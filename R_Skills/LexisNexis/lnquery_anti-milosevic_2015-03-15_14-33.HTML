<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Serbia's elections near, Eve-Ann Prentice meets a leading member of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of Slobodan Milosevic's chief opponents will not be out campaigning against the Yugoslav President during next weekend's presidential and parliamentary elections in Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, Ivan Marovic, 26, will be settling down to a new life - as a soldier in the Yugoslav Army. One of the leading lights in the student-led resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor, the mechanical engineer was posted to Barr in Montenegro to begin his compulsory national service ten days ago. But he will almost certainly not prove an easy recruit for any Serbian drill-sergeant looking for unquestioning obedience.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sitting in a pavement cafe outside the central Belgrade headquarters of the Otpor </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recently, Marovic spoke to me, in near-perfect English, about the goals and tactics of the youth-based organisation that aims to overthrow the Serbian regime. The group has seen a phenomenal growth in the past year, from a few hundred members in December last year to 100,000 today, according to Marovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blue-uniformed, armed police hovered uncomfortably close as he spoke. A huge banner with the organisation's symbol of a clenched fist billowed in the breeze as it hung from a first-floor window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor (meaning Resistance) is not a political party, yet it has galvanised huge numbers of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbs. Though most of its supporters are still young, what started as a student protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 1988 is attracting the unemployed and some pensioners. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is throwing its weight behind the main opposition candidate standing against Milosevic in Sunday's poll, Vojislav Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marovic spoke in a blisteringly hot Belgrade as trolley-buses thick with grime and seemingly held together with bits of twine carried those lucky enough to have jobs off to their workplaces. Bomb damage to factories after last year's Nato airstrikes, along with the effects of sanctions, have cost many Serbs their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is against this background of daily grind that many young people of Serbia have united. The cafes seem as busy as ever, but a closer look reveals that many customers are lingering over a single coffee. Ill-paid university professors take second jobs driving trolley-buses and schoolteachers have been known to rummage in dustbins for food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many are worried that Serbia is on the brink of another war, this time against Montenegro, the only other republic, with Serbia, to make up federal Yugoslavia. Four other republics - Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia - have seceded in the Balkan upheavals of the past decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Milosevic earlier this year led moves to change the constitution to allow himself to be elected by the federal Parliament for two more terms, an act seen as being calculated to infuriate Montenegro's leaders, who have been straining at the leash since before last year's bombing campaign by Nato. Many think that they still have years of Milosevic's rule to come, along with unending international hostility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ivan Marovic knew in July that he would be called up by the Army this month, yet he claims that his absence from the political fray will make no difference to Otpor. &quot;We have made sure that our organisation does not depend on one person,&quot; he says. &quot;So whoever gets arrested or killed or goes over to join the Government does not hurt Otpor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This philosophy has helped the group to cope with increasing harassment by the regime in the run-up to Sunday's elections. On September 4, plainclothes and uniformed police raided Otpor's Belgrade headquarters and carted off two computers, as well as thousands of T-shirts, posters and badges. &quot;I keep the business cards only of people in the regime in our offices so that only they can be linked to us if the cards are seized,&quot; says Marovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On September 9, Marovic was given a rousing send-off to his year in the Army at a street party in Belgrade's main shopping street. The next day, more plainclothes police descended on Otpor's headquarters with the intention of carrying off more of the organisation's equipment - but this time their haul consisted of empty cardboard boxes. The police were also far rougher with the Otpor activists inside the headquarters building, slapping faces and pushing members about, Otpor said last week. A photographer had his camera seized when he was stopped while driving a car emblazoned with an Otpor sticker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organisation says 350 of its supporters have been arrested in recent months, albeit most of them briefly, and that 100 have been beaten up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our main goal is to make the transition of our society into a true democracy, with political and economic stability. There are two conditions for this: the removal of the Milosevic regime and free and fair elections,&quot; says Marovic. &quot;We encourage people to stand and fight for their rights, to be politically active.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor espouses peaceful resistance, however: &quot;There can be no change by violent methods,&quot; says Marovic. &quot;Violent change would only give us a new Milosevic. Otpor is more a state of mind than an organisation as such.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is the young who seem to be more willing to risk the ire of the regime by campaigning against the Government of Milosevic, and Otpor's rise has helped to reveal a growing generation gap. Many of Otpor's young members are the children of active or tacit supporters of the ruling Socialist Party. This is because many older people still see socialism as an antidote to the fascism that blighted the Balkans during the Second World War, and partly because they are weary of conflict after a decade of civil strife and sanctions in the region. Older people also remember years of comparative wealth and ease in the 1970s and 1980s, when Yugoslavia was regarded with envy by the people from other socialist countries before the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is interesting that the young are not afraid,&quot; says Marovic. &quot;The police have started searching our apartments, and since most of us live with our parents, it is our parents who are afraid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nenad Sitarica is a 22-year-old political science student and a core Otpor member in Belgrade. His father is a candidate for President Milosevic's Socialist Party in the elections. &quot;There is a big generation gap,&quot; says Sitarica. &quot;My father has been a member of the party since he was 16.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many young educated Serbs have already made new lives abroad; others plan to go. Some have turned to the Orthodox Church, with a surge in young people becoming priests and nuns, to their parents' chagrin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Marovic will stay on when he completes his national service: &quot;I considered living abroad, but I would feel defeated if I left. This country is worth fighting for. If you had a parent in a mental hospital, you would still visit him, you would not leave home.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a setback to efforts to unseat Slobodan Milosevic, an opposition leader denounced rivals in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and said his followers would boycott joint rallies aimed at forcing the Yugoslav president to step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, head of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accused another opposition group led by Zoran Djindjic of pushing the country to civil war by refusing offers of early elections to end the political crisis that followed the 78- day NATO bombing campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the latest episode in a persistent rift between the opposition groups. The rift has long frustrated efforts to topple Milosevic, whose confrontational policies have dragged this country into four disastrous wars that have left Yugoslavia in economic ruin.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic wants to accept the Milosevic government's offer of early elections this fall. Djindjic and his allies, by contrast, insist that Milosevic step down immediately and make way for a transitional government pending new elections under international supervision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic, a former deputy prime minister, dismissed Djindjic's Democratic party as ''gentlemen who do not want elections, who do not seek a political agreement, who prefer to count rifles and dead Serbs instead of ballots.'' He made the comment in an interview with a provincial television station that was distributed yesterday by the independent news agency Beta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview published Saturday by the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Draskovic warned that ''if there aren't elections, there will be a civil war.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're very, very close,'' he said.  ''And I'm against another war at all costs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic rejected Draskovic's accusations and hinted that Draskovic may not be serious in demanding that Milosevic go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are not seeking co-operation with the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (alone) but with all those who want Milosevic to leave,'' he said in a statement carried by Beta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Those who want Milosevic to leave should tell the people so outright,'' Djindjic said. ''And if they don't want him to leave, they should say so as well.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rift between Draskovic and Djindjic has reared its head before. Three months of massive protests in 1996 and 1997 swayed Milosevic but did not topple him. Then, like now, rifts appeared in the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, an estimated 150,000 people turned out here for the biggest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally in the capital in years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic was jeered when he echoed the Milosevic government's call for early elections. He blamed the hostile reception on ''militant Djindjic activists'' and said his party would henceforth boycott rallies organized by the Alliance for Change, a coalition of opposition groups including Djindjic's Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They will see how many supporters they have when Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stops courting them and filling up the squares where they stage their rallies, because the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> no longer has a reason to be there,'' Draskovic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cautioned the opposition to be careful of making promises to the public that it cannot fulfill. During Thursday's rally, Djindjic gave Milosevic 15 days to resign or ''the whole of Serbia will rise up'' in street protests and a general strike will be called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A comparatively small party, New Democracy, has appealed for unity among Milosevic's opponents. It said the three existing concepts for reform, a transitional government, political pressures and early elections ''are not mutually exclusive.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That party was once allied with Milosevic but has turned to the opposition in recent years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his 12 years in power, whenever Slobodan Milosevic has been on the ropes, most of the punches have been thrown here in the Serbian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is where the Serbian leader called out Yugoslav Army tanks and used tear gas eight years ago to put down a violent demonstration against state-controlled television, the key lever in his control of public opinion. It was here that the depth of urban middle-class revulsion with Mr. Milosevic's rule was shown to the world in three solid months of daily street demonstrations in the winter of 1996-97.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Belgrade, so far, has been a conspicuous wallflower in the growing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that has found expression across Serbia in the last two weeks. This city has about a fifth of Serbia's population and about 40 percent of its educated middle-class, yet all the action has been in the boondocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With rallies in smaller cities across Serbia, the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has tapped frustration among restive army reservists, who are home from the lost war in Kosovo and, for the most part, unpaid for their trouble. Discontented Serbs also say they fear for their future in the collapsed postwar economy, are weary of international isolation and are shamed by crimes committed in their name in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Belgrade's city council argued itself into paralysis this week over the question of Mr. Milosevic's resignation, city leaders in three cities -- Novi Sad, Nis and Sombor -- quickly approved resolutions demanding that he step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delay in Belgrade's involvement in this season's round of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations does not derive from any lack of ambient animus toward the Yugoslav President, who has been indicted as a war criminal and has lost four straight wars while turning once-prosperous Serbia into the basket-case economy of Eastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the streets here on Friday night, it was difficult to find a citizen of Belgrade, young or old, middle-class or poor, who did not believe the time had come for Mr. Milosevic to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to see him strung up and hanging in the center of town,&quot; said Ivan Tarla, 23, a film student at the University of Belgrade. &quot;We are ready to go out into the street, but we need very clear goals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fractured opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Serbia is not planning demonstrations in Belgrade until late August precisely because it does not yet have a unified set of goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Milosevic, meanwhile, is attending to his main instrument of control -- the same state-controlled television that Belgraders demonstrated against en masse in 1991. He will rebuild the bombed television headquarters in the capital, officials say, before the bridges that NATO smashed all over Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the largest single opposition party -- the only one that can guarantee the daily presence of tens of thousands of demonstrators on the streets of the capital for weeks on end -- has not yet joined the Alliance for Change, the coalition of smaller opposition parties that is organizing rallies against Mr. Milosevic outside Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- led by Vuk Draskovic, the self-proclaimed &quot;king of the streets&quot; and an on-again, off-again critic of the Milosevic regime -- is sitting on its hands for the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic, who briefly served as a deputy minister in Mr. Milosevic's Government before being fired in the middle of the Kosovo war, has said the time is not yet ripe for demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls indicate that in the aftermath of the Kosovo war, Mr. Draskovic's party gained strength and won the support of about 15 percent of Serbia's population, far more than any other opposition group. His party leads a coalition that runs city hall in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Probably more important, he controls a Belgrade television station, Studio B, a widely watched alternative to state television in the capital. Leaders of smaller opposition parties say they must gain better access to Studio B to whip up mass enthusiasm for demonstrations in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic's personal political ambitions seem to be keeping his party out of the streets. He holds a grudge against Zoran Djindjic, the key leader of the Alliance for Change. The bad blood grows out of Mr. Djindjic's boycott of an election two years ago, when Mr. Draskovic ran for President of Serbia. Badly needing those opposition votes, he finished a poor third.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His advisers say Mr. Draskovic has decided that the only way to force Mr. Milosevic from power is for a strong individual politician to rise above a decade of confused infighting among multiple small and ineffectual opposition parties and give Serbs one clear alternative. That alternative, in their view, is none other than Mr. Draskovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of the Alliance for Change, while resentful of what they say is Mr. Draskovic's self-involved brand of politics, do not dismiss his importance -- especially in street demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need Mr. Draskovic's support,&quot; said Slobodan Vuksanovic, a senior strategist in the Alliance for Change. &quot;We need him because of the number of people he can deliver and because of Studio B. Belgrade is the heart of Serbia in a political sense. Everything depends on the success of the demonstrations there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Vuksanovic said that in Belgrade, unlike most of the rest of Serbia, the organizational structure of the ruling and opposition parties is strong and relatively well disciplined. To pull off a series of major demonstrations that is big enough not to be disrupted by Mr. Milosevic's police or by supporters of the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, he said, the Alliance for Change has no choice but to try to ally itself with Mr. Draskovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Successful rallies in the boondocks, then, are a way of convincing Mr. Draskovic and members of his Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that if they stand on the sidelines for too long they may be left out altogether in divvying up power in a post-Milosevic Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were signals this week that the strategy is beginning to work, as a surprisingly passionate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bubbled up in the least likely of Serbian towns. In the southern city of Leskovac, long dominated by Mr. Milosevic's supporters, more than 20,000 people filled the streets on Monday. The protest was followed by smaller demonstrations throughout the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Startled and anxious to cash in on popular sentiment, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decided on Wednesday to help locals in Leskovac organize their demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of Mr. Draskovic's party conceded in Belgrade that they had underestimated grass-roots anger at the Milosevic regime. As for future rallies, they seemed to be opening a door that Mr. Draskovic, just two weeks ago, slammed shut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vuk knows when the time comes,&quot; said Ognjen Pribicevic, a political adviser to Mr. Draskovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Belgrade, it seems many people are ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will be the first in the streets because I have had enough,&quot; said Mira Angelic, 50, a lawyer. &quot;Right now, there is no spark to start the fire. But I think it is a question of days and weeks. The spark eventually has to come from Belgrade.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SERBIAN OPPOSITION leaders claimed yesterday that Friday night's anti -government rally was evidence that the pro-democracy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was building the momentum to remove Slobodan Milosevic from power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seventeen opposition leaders, including Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his rival Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party, stood on the same platform and were cheered by the 100,000 people who packed Belgrade's Republic Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our lives are not lives any more after the last 10 years of Milosevic rule. The isolation we face makes us think that we live in a plague-infected country&quot; said Mr Draskovic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rally was the opposition's first joint protest since its leaders united behind a much-publicised accord in January to call for early free and fair elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local elections are due this year and the crucial parliamentary elections next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The opposition no longer has any choice. This rally cannot and must not be ignored,&quot; political analyst Srdjan Bogosavljevic told independent Belgrade radio B292.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign has &quot;achieved such a level of support that the opposition has no right to betray public expectations,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miroljub Labus, head of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> G17 group, said that the rally had &quot;sent a message both to the government and the opposition. The regime got a message that many people are absolutely dissatisfied with what is happening nowadays, and that they are expecting changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aleksandar Vucic, Serbia's information minister, claimed he &quot;heard nothing intelligent&quot; from the opposition leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;After the rally, I am convinced we will win in the coming elections,&quot; said Mr Vucic, of the ultra-nationalist Radical Party, which is allied with Milosevic's Socialists and the neo-communist JUL party, which is led by Mr Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs Markovic, in turn, lambasted the opposition leaders as &quot;monstrous advocates of violence and of complete war against political opponents&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A recent survey by the Belgrade Institute for Social Sciences showed that the united Serbian opposition would have 46 per cent of votes if the elections were held now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ruling coalition of the Socialists, JUL and the ultra-nationalists of Vojislav Seselj would obtain only 23 per cent of votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost 20 per cent of voters would be undecided, while a little under 12 per cent of voters would not go to the polls, the survey found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forced off the air by state seizure of their studios, Belgrade's independent broadcasters were reduced Thursday to reading the nightly news from a balcony of City Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news anchors had to pause each time they read out Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's name Thursday night, however, as a crowd of about 10,000 demonstrators below demanded his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Slobodan, save Serbia,&quot; the protesters chanted. &quot;Kill yourself!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbian riot police fired tear gas and beat protesters for a second night in a row after some in the crowd set fire to garbage bins and threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers who blocked a march through the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 12 people were treated for minor injuries following the skirmishes, which lasted for more than an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests, brief clashes with riot police have become more of a violent ritual than a sign of the long-awaited uprising that protesters repeatedly called for again Thursday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The balcony news readings included a statement issued by Serbia's interior ministry police, who said four officers had been injured, two of them seriously, in the first night of unrest Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 60 injured protesters had gone to emergency rooms for treatment, the news reader also told the jeering crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition leaders told the crowd they would hold daily demonstrations until Milosevic gives in to their demand for early elections, but they have made that rallying cry before, only to call off protests as interest lagged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest confrontation with Milosevic -- sparked by the Serbian government's seizure of Yugoslavia's main independent television and radio stations in the dead of night -- has failed to draw crowds even half as large as several previous protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A leading critic of Milosevic, Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief Vuk Draskovic, didn't attend Thursday's rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His main rival in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democratic party chief Zoran Djindjic, attended but didn't speak. Four minor opposition figures spoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's increasing repression is &quot;confirmation that we are in a state of emergency,&quot; said Vukasin Petrovic, a 24-year-old leader of the democracy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called Otpor -- Resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accused Hadzi Dragan Antic, one of Milosevic's closest family friends and editor in chief of the state-run Politika publishing house, of &quot;leading the war against&quot; Otpor as head of a secret &quot;crisis headquarters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International condemnation of the Serbian government's seizure of independent broadcasters Studio B and Radio B2-92, including sharp words from the United States and European Union, fell on deaf ears in Milosevic's regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government moved to silence the last independent broadcaster with a signal strong enough to reach Belgrade -- the capital of Yugoslavia and its dominant republic, Serbia -- by jamming Radio Pancevo's transmission from a nearby suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Vojislav Seselj, who co-signed the decree authorizing Studio B's seizure, told a news conference Thursday that he hopes more independent broadcasters and print publications will be closed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bulldozers are back, and this time they've got the Untouchables behind them. The excavation machines are symbols of the mass uprising that drove out Slobodan Milosevic on Oct. 5, clearing the way for a new Yugoslav government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now the student-based Otpor </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which played a leading role in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign, has brought back the bulldozers, this time on giant black-and-white billboards and posters plastered all across the Yugoslav capital. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The posters carry a warning for both the country's old and new guard: &quot;We are watching you.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The message makes clear that Otpor has not thrown its lot in with the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, the political alliance that dominates the new federal government and backs new President Vojislav Kostunica. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our opinion is that those guys from DOS, they are all politicians from Milosevic's time. Some of them are politicians from Tito's time,&quot; said Otpor co-founder Dejan Randic, referring to Yugoslav post-war leader Marshal Josip Broz Tito. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And we don't have any need to be connected in some kind of government.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The posters also tell members of Mr. Milosevic's long-ruling Socialists and their allies, many of whom still hold key state and business positions, that they are not off the hook. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor, which is the Serbian word for resistance, has formed a group of lawyers and legal experts to gather evidence of corruption and crime committed under Mr. Milosevic by the bosses of factories, businesses and public authorities across the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some Otpor activists liken the new group to the Untouchables led by Eliot Ness, who battled gangsters and enforced prohibition in 1920s Chicago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aleksandar Curcic, one of the lawyers in the group, which is formally named the Bureau for Enforcing the Truth, says there are many differences between the new team and the Untouchables, but notes one common factor: the potential to make dangerous enemies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You can only compare us in terms of the risk we are taking in the pursuit of justice,&quot; he said in an interview at Otpor's central Belgrade headquarters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People in their teens and early 20s, wearing jeans and bomber jackets, hang around the two-room office. A pile of crumpled Otpor posters lies in a corner of a sparsely furnished room. A list of activists' mobile-phone numbers is posted on one wall. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group of about 30 lawyers is in the early stages of collecting evidence, having started in the past couple of weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About 40 people arrive every day, bearing tales of corruption and crime that went unpunished under Mr. Milosevic, Mr. Curcic said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their stories range from tales of fraud or financial mismanagement to beatings of pro-democracy campaigners. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new group aims to banish the climate of fear that existed under Mr. Milosevic and his repressive state apparatus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Previously, there was a situation in which citizens were afraid of directly pointing fingers at criminals,&quot; said Mr. Curcic, who got to know the student activists because he defended them in court in the Milosevic era. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Now is the time when citizens should point out these things,&quot; he said. &quot;And it's much easier for citizens to do this with an organization in which they have confidence. Otpor is an organization like that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commentators agree Otpor gave a fresh and credible appeal to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when it emerged a couple of years ago, unsoiled by the squabbling and allegations of corruption associated with the former president's established opponents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now DOS leaders want a chance to go to work, and worry that Otpor's latest campaign could turn people against them as they are just getting started. But the activists are unrepentant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was a people's revolution and the political parties are responsible for our future. And we wanted to say that there must be some kind of pressure group in this situation on both sides,&quot; explained Mr. Randic, an electronics student. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Otpor will broaden its activities, seeking to help end Yugoslavia's years of isolation by fostering links with neighbouring states, until recently considered the country's sworn enemies, and organizing student exchange programs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group, which recently won MTV's Free-Your-Mind award at a ceremony in Stockholm, has two more campaigns in the works. One will warn people against turning back to the Socialists and the other will urge young people to vote in the Dec. 23 elections in Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The home town of President Slobodan Milosevic was the focus of a major clampdown on opposition to his rule across Serbia yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police arrested an opposition leader, journalists and members of the youth resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and set up checkpoints on all roads in and out of Pozarevac - where the Yugoslav president grew up and has a home - to prevent opposition supporters and political leaders arriving for a major opposition rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But about 100 members of the youth resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Otpor, and other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activists slipped past the cordon to interrupt a hastily convened counter-meeting set up by officials in Pozarevac's central square.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By mid-afternoon, it was the scene of an extraordinary standoff, with the banner-waving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protesters on one side and Socialist party officials from the city seeking to address 100 or so party stalwarts on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small group of men in black trousers, black leather jackets and sunglasses - the usual garb of men working as Milosevic family bodyguards - moved to within inches of the jeering protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators did not shift or back away, but continued distributing leaflets and brandishing their flags and placards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One 23-year-old Otpor protester said: &quot;We want to show our resistance to the system. Milosevic is afraid of the youth of Otpor. We have parents. We have relatives. We have so many people who know us and know we are not the terrorists which the regime calls us. We just want to live like ordinary people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hundred yards from the standoff, the Serbian Minister of the Interior, Mr Veljko Stoiljkovic, watched, as did several dozen young men wearing T-shirts with the Serbian national flag. It was as if they might be waiting for a signal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pozarevac is a haven for the Milosevic family and its enterprises. Several domestic and foreign journalists and cameramen, who had also slipped into the town through the police cordon, watched as the standoff continued. Every minute threatened to explode into violent confrontation, if either side made a wrong move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities had sought in every way to block the rally, held on Victory Day, which traditionally celebrates the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. A lorry taking stage and sound equipment into the town was stopped en route shortly after midnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An opposition leader, Mr Nenad Canak from the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina, was arrested early yesterday morning on his way from Novi Sad to Pozarevac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Belgrade, opposition leaders held an emergency meeting after coaches they had ordered to take them to the rally failed to turn up or were sent back to Belgrade by police at checkpoints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The non-government radio station B292 and the Belgrade television station Studio B, controlled by the opposition Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were taken off the air. Opposition leaders said they would hold a major demonstration in the capital within days to protest at yesterday's events.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BERLIN, FRIDAY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first stirrings of revolution that have begun in Serbia against President Slobodan Milosevic's leadership are raising hopes that the end of his reign is nigh. But there are also fears that the end will bring still more traumatic upheaval to the Balkans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbian democrats are mobilising for a &quot;velvet&quot; revolution similar to those in other eastern European countries. But concern is growing that Mr Milosevic and his fanatical supporters will resist change with force and that Serbia's transition to democracy will come only after a &quot;crimson&quot; revolution - with the spilling of more blood.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grass-roots hostility to Mr Milosevic's leadership, which has inflicted a decade of conflict and misery on the people of the former Yugoslavia, is emerging across Serbia. The strength of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> feeling and the speed with which it is emerging suggest that he is facing the prospect of a mass uprising. Brutal suppression may be the only means left open to him to keep his grip on power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His 10-year rule of Yugoslavia has been characterised by his determination to maintain personal power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disastrous military adventures he launched in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo have greatly diminished his standing with the Serbian people. But Mr Milosevic has consolidated his grip by building a formidable state security structure. Most observers believe this agency will remain loyal to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cautioning against hopes for his speedy demise, the NATO military commander, General Wesley Clark, said: &quot;He still has his hand on the sinews of power in Serbia. He controls the army. He controls the police, including a very effective and brutal secret police network. He controls the media and he controls the economy and finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see that the opposition is fragmented and weak. It's been traumatised by a decade of President Milosevic's manoeuvring, dividing the opposition, suborning the opposition, and basically his campaign of covert terror against them.&quot; General Clark said it was difficult to &quot;predict with assurance&quot; that President Milosevic will be overthrown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alarming signs have emerged in the past few days that attempts to mobilise a peaceful push for change will bring a violent response from Mr Milosevic's supporters. Already Serbs have seen the first clashes between the two camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the southern town of Prokuplje, where 4000 people marched in the streets, protesters clashed, trading punches and sending tensions soaring. A shot was fired over the crowd from the local headquarters of Mr Milosevic's Socialist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Leskovac, a stronghold of the Socialist Party where large protest rallies have confirmed the depth of anger, demonstrators attacked the home of the local party leader and Milosevic supporter, Mr Zivojin Stefanovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Leskovac demonstrations are seen as important because they appear to have been a spontaneous action of local people. Most other recent demonstrations were organised by various opposition groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spark for the Leskovac demonstrations came from a 31-year-old television technician without any history of political activism. Last Friday night Ivan Novkovic interrupted the televising of a basketball match to broadcast a recorded message accusing the party leader, Mr Stefanovic, of abusing his authority, appointing cronies to head local companies and destroying the local economy. Mr Novkovic was arrested and sentenced to 30 days' jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His action has created a scramble by Opposition parties to tap into the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sentiment in his own political stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has also highlighted the great weakness of the campaign to oust Mr Milosevic and the reason his position appears to be secure, at least for the time being: the Serbian opposition remains divided and leaderless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign observers believe the first real test of whether the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can become a serious threat will come when Serbia's most respected political figure returns to Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former central bank governor Mr Dragoslav Avramovic, who has played a key role in the creation of the Alliance for Change </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Serbia, may have the best chance of bringing together the divided nation.</SPAN></P>

Gillian Sandford reports from Belgrade</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Serbian cartoonist Corax is famous for a caricature that he drew before the NATO bombing. It shows Slobodan Milosevic and his wife desperately hanging on to the minute-hand of a clock, trying to hold back time as the midnight hour approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid all the sound and fury of recent weeks in Serbia, the hands of that clock have continued to move. The clock kept ticking when Serbia's government silenced and crippled leading non-government media. It kept ticking when armed police fired tear gas at protesters and besieged hundreds in Belgrade City Hall. It continues ticking as the authorities threaten a stringent antiterrorism law.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all the uncertainties of Serbia, as the regime and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> forces plan and strategise, the clock marks time towards one crucial event. According to the constitution, local and federal elections have to be held by the end of this month. That deadline has triggered the escalation in tension across Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media provide a crucial battleground prior to the local elections in which Milosevic needs to reclaim a swathe of town halls that the opposition now holds; most importantly, he needs to wrench back the capital. Control of information is a major asset in this political fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police stormed the Studio B building in Belgrade, silencing the leading opposition voice in the capital, they did so with a formal approval signed by Serbia's two deputy prime ministers who gave a series of reasons for taking over the station. Studio B is still broadcasting, but content is controlled by the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Studio B building housed all Serbia's leading non-state media: both non-government radio and the most popular newspaper in Yugoslavia, Blic. These are now operating but in a much constrained form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blic, with a previous circulation of 200,000, is now unable to find presses to print more than 75,000 - the state owns presses and controls paper supply. The Belgrade radio station, Index, is again broadcasting news, but police are yards away from their offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Milosevic regime now has a far tighter grip on information. It possesses the only two country-wide television stations: Radio Television Serbia (RTS), widely viewed as the mouthpiece of the regime, and TV Politika. Studio B had the potential to reach much of Serbia, but it has now been neutralised as an opposition voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veran Matic, spokesman for the independent media organisation ANEM, fears the next move of the regime will be to shut down opposition radio and TV outlets outside of the capital, following the Belgrade clampdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editor of Blic, Veselin Simonovic, is sharply critical of the political opposition in Serbia, who, he says, ratcheted down the protests against the storming of the Studio B building and left journalists and youth activists from the resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor in the front line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those in the front line are journalists and members of the youth resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. That's not a normal situation,&quot; he said. &quot;We accepted a risk all these years when we put out the paper, but being in the front line is not the job of journalists, it's the job of opposition political parties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists are exposed because of the lack of leadership from the country's divided political opposition, says Simonovic. He admires citizens in Belgrade who were willing to risk their safety to protest against the media clampdown but says: &quot;I condemn the behaviour of the opposition, who, perhaps because of fear, perhaps because they can't find a unified position, succeeded in virtually stopping the protests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most popular </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> force to emerge over recent weeks has been the student group Otpor(meaning &quot;resistance&quot;). According to insiders in Otpor, polling from Milosevic's own party now shows that Otpor far outstrips the ruling Socialist party in popularity. They say Otpor has 28 per cent of popular support and Milosevic has just 14 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regime has publicly branded Otpor activists as traitors, terrorists and NATO agents, and is now threatening to introduce a stringent anti-terrorism law. Analysts say this could give the government the same powers it had during the martial law of the NATO bombing. Power to arrest and hold suspects indefinitely; power to clamp down on the press; it might also include the power to disarm civilians who hold guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radical activists within Otpor and in the ranks of the political opposition are urging a campaign of civil disobedience that would be enacted across Serbia. Those town halls controlled by the opposition could use their power, they argue, to shut down bus services, close facilities and bring their communities to a standstill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otpor is seeking to recruit supporters from its home base, the universities, and is actively courting students who were previously apathetic or disillusioned with political protest. &quot;Our aim is to radicalise and mobilise students,&quot; said Otpor activist Branko Ilic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regime has responded by curtailing the university year in a bid to curb activism. Only examination students with identity cards can now pass into their faculty buildings. Many Otpor activists want to move towards an immediate campaign of civil disobedience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zarko Korac, a Belgrade academic and leader of one of the smaller opposition parties, would support such a move, but says the larger parties who control the town halls across Serbia are concerned about the risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Otpor has a second, long-term strategy outlined by an activist and young lawyer, Slobodan Homen. The Milosevic regime has always sought to exist within the letter of the law. He has deployed security forces - police and army - in the cause of defending the country and upholding the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People in Serbia expect to have the right to vote, although an increasing number of them are disillusioned with both the government and opposition and almost half tell pollsters they don't know or won't vote in elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homen claims potential voters who say they are undecided or are not going to vote are almost all opposition supporters. Otpor will use its youngsters in towns and cities across Serbia to get that electorate out - and plead with them to give the opposition a chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That way, he believes, a peaceful transfer of power can be achieved, and if a Hague indictment needs to be finessed to help further a bloodless transfer, he says he would accept that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are fighting for demands like free and fair elections - and with those demands we can gain the support of the police and the army, because we are defending the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is he so certain that the forces of security will back off? &quot;It's very hard to explain to a soldier in a tank that he has to shoot people who are demanding elections,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gillian Sandford in Pozarevac, Serbia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The home town of Slobodan Milosevic was the focus of a major clampdown on opposition to the rule of President Slobodan Milosevic across Serbia yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police arrested an opposition leader, journalists and members of the youth resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and set up checkpoints on all roads in and out of Pozarevac - where the Yugoslav president grew up and has a home - to prevent opposition supporters and political leaders arriving for a major opposition rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But around 100 members of the Youth Resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Otpor, and other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti -Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activists slipped past the cordon to interrupt a hastily convened counter-meeting set up by officials in Pozarevac's central square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By mid-afternoon, it was the scene of an extraordinary stand-off, with the banner-waving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protesters on one side and Socialist party officials from the city seeking to address 100 or so party stalwarts on the other.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A small group of men in black trousers, black leather jackets and sunglasses - the usual garb of men working as Milosevic family bodyguards - moved to within inches of the jeering protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The demonstrators did not shift or back away, but continued distributing leaflets and brandishing their flags and placards, bearing the clenched fist symbol of Otpor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One 23-year-old Otpor protester said: 'We want to show our resistance to the system. Milosevic is afraid of the youth of Otpor. We have parents. We have relatives. We have so many people who know us and know we are not the terrorists which the regime calls us. We just want to live like ordinary people.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A hundred yards from the stand-off, the Serbian minister of the interior, Veljko Stoiljkovic, watched, as did several dozen young men wearing T-shirts with the Serbian national flag. It was as if they might be waiting for a signal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pozarevac is a haven for the Milosevic family and its enterprises. Marko Milosevic runs the Madonna disco, which has the reputation as the hottest nightclub in the Balkans, a cybercafe and coffee shop called Passage in the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of President Milosevic's friends from childhood in Pozarevac have become significant figures in his regime. The interior minister is among this group, as was Zika Petrovic, the recently assassinated head of Yugoslav Airlines JAP, who was gunned down in Belgrade just over a week ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several domestic and foreign journalists and cameramen, who had also slipped into the town through the police cordon, watched as the stand-off continued. Every minute threatened to explode into violent confrontation, if either side made a wrong move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The authorities had sought in every way to block the rally, held on Victory Day, which traditionally celebrates the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. A lorry taking stage and sound equipment into the town was stopped en route shortly after midnight yesterday, said Dra gan Curcija, an official from the opposition democratic party in Pozarevac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An opposition leader, Nenad Canak from the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina, was arrested early yesterday morning on his way from Novi Sad to Pozarevac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Belgrade, opposition leaders held an emergency meeting after coaches they had ordered to take them to the rally failed to turn up or were sent back to Belgrade by police at checkpoints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The non-government radio station B292 and the Belgrade television station Studio B, controlled by the opposition Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were taken off the air. Opposition leaders said they would hold a major demonstration in the capital within days to protest at yesterday's events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The incident that sparked this crisis happened last week in Pozarevac, when three members of the Otpor </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> became involved in a fracas with bodyguards of Milosevic's son Marko. They were arrested, held beyond the maximum legal detention period and appeared to have been beaten when they appeared before an investigating magistrate on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One, Radoje Lukovic, had a 10cm head wound, the other two were in bandages with bloodstained pads around their eyes, said their lawyer, Borivoje Bokovic of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They had been released, but yesterday they were arrested again, with a freelance reporter for non-government media who works in Pozarevac and is a brother of one of the three.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Atop a private terrace overlooking the Danube River and a picturesque Belgrade skyline, the leaders of Serbia's heretofore splintered opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gather regularly to discuss a collective strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The serene atmosphere of this secret club provides a surreal setting for the discussions of violence and civil disobedience which are being plotted over wine, slivovitz and barbecued pork.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the factions propose divergent policies, the consensus is a solitary goal: the immediate overthrow of President Slobodan Milosevic's regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The owner of this establishment is Jovan Mandic, a former power company executive who has already paid a heavy price for challenging ''the regime.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, Mr. Mandic assisted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrators by ordering a power black-out of Belgrade during a 200,000-strong candlelight procession. For his actions, Mr. Mandic lost his top-level job and was beaten severely for 48 hours by the Yugoslav police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undeterred, Mr. Mandic has since dedicated his efforts to the ''removal of the communists,'' and he has tirelessly networked to co- ordinate the various Milosevic opponents into a unified voice. His private club is frequented only by invited ''intelligentsia'' and political activists.  From these meetings, the strategies are developed that culminate in the organization of student demonstrations and widespread general strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until recently, Mr. Mandic's ''club'' had put its support behind the various registered political parties, but that is no longer the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Among the population, these so-called opposition leaders have lost all credibility,'' said Mr. Mandic. ''It is time for a new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and an entirely fresh leader.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In pursuit of this objective, the club has openly embraced the creation of the new OTPOR (resistance) and helped to organize the recent mass demonstrations. As for a new leader, the club has chosen to support a political neophyte named Milan Protic, a charismatic 45-year-old university professor. Last week Mr. Protic and 100 influential signatories registered as an official political party, thereby creating the 16th such organization currently seeking a measure of popular support in Serbia. In an effort to gain a higher moral ground, the club has successfully enlisted the support of orthodox priests from Halkidiki, the Serbian religious region located in Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other end of the spectrum, the club intends to establish the Protic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a ''serious resistance force'' in the forthcoming two weeks. ''There will probably be a rash of executions in the next 10-14 days,'' said one club member. ''Killing people is the only way to get the regime's attention.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With their opposition showing the first signs of establishing a united front, Slobodan Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party could be facing a very tough time. The Yugoslav president is currently embattled on several fronts that are beyond his control and damaging to what is left of his popular support. One year after it was signed, several key terms of the Kosovo Peace Agreement with NATO have yet to even be partially adopted, making a mockery of Mr. Milosevic's claims of a ''victory.'' So far, NATO officials have refused to allow the Serbs any of the rights to enforce sovereignty over Kosovo as was outlined and agreed to in the peace proposal. The Kosovo Liberation Army has nominally been ''disarmed,'' albeit reconstituted as the Kosovo Protection Corps, yet Serbian military and border guards have still not been allowed back into (what is still officially recognized as) the Yugoslavian sovereign territory of Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second major factor affecting Mr. Milosevic is the tremendous strain put on his bankrupt treasury by the ongoing NATO sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to problems with the economy and political unrest, the Milosevic regime was dealt another blow last week when Bulgaria announced it would open a separate diplomatic mission in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite all the mounting pressures, it will be necessary for the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to create the climate required for fundamental change. At this point, the option of an armed revolution is no longer being discounted. The club believes that the army (excluding the senior brass) would support a coup. When asked about the tragedy of Serbs killing Serbs in a civil war, Mr. Mandic replied, ''We would consider it to be Serbs versus communists.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite growing popular anger, the Yugoslav Presidnet's lust for power, and lack of opposition unity, mean there could be more bloodshed to come, reports Herald Correspondent Geoff Kitney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE first stirrings of revolution in Serbia against the authoritarian leadership of President Slobodan Milosevic are raising hopes his brutal reign may be coming to an end. But there are fears the end will be the beginning of more traumatic upheaval to the Balkans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Serbian democrats mobilise in the hope of making a &quot;velvet&quot; revolution - similar to the peaceful transfer of power from Communist dictatorship to liberal democracy that occurred in other eastern European countries - there is growing concern Milosevic and his fanatical supporters will resist change with force, forcing the uprising instead to become a &quot;crimson&quot; revolution, stained with much blood.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grassroots hostility to Milosevic, who has inflicted conflict and misery on his people, is flourishing across Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its strength and the speed with which it is emerging suggest he faces the real prospect of a mass uprising. But Milosevic is unlikely to go quietly. His 10-year rule of Yugoslavia has been characterised by a ferocious determination to maintain his personal power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disastrous military adventures he has launched in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo have greatly diminished his standing with the Serbian people. But Milosevic has built a formidable state security structure that most observers believe is likely to stay loyal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alarming signs have emerged in recent days that street protests will be met with violent resistance from Milosevic's supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the southern Serbian town of Prokuplje, where 4,000 people marched in the streets, anti- and pro- Milosevic demonstrators clashed, trading punches. Shots were fired into the air from the local headquarters of Milosevic's Socialist Party. In the city of Leskovac, a stronghold of the Socialist Party where large protest rallies have confirmed the depth of anger against Milosevic, demonstrators attacked the home of the local party leader and Milosevic ally, Zivojin Stefanovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western observers see the Leskovac demonstrations as important because they appear to have been the spontaneous action of local people. Most other recent demonstrations were organised by opposition groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spark for the demonstrations in Leskovac was the action of a 31-year-old television technician without any history of political activism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Friday night Ivan Novkovic interrupted the televising of a basketball match to broadcast a recording of himself accusing Mr Stefanovic of abusing his authority, appointing cronies to head local companies and destroying the local economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Novkovic was arrested and sentenced to 30 days' jail, but his action appears to have turned him into a local hero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident created a scramble by opposition parties to try to tap into the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sentiment in his own political stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this has highlighted the great weakness of the campaign to oust Milosevic and why his position appears to be secure for the time being at least - the Serbian opposition remains divided and leaderless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign observers believe the first real test of whether the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can combine and become a serious threat will come when the man regarded as Serbia's most respected political figure returns to Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dragoslav Avramovic, a former governor of the central bank who has played a key role in the creation of the Alliance for Change </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Serbia, is regarded as the person who may have the best chance of bringing divided opposition parties together</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">under single leadership. He is due to return next week after receiving medical treatment in Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a newspaper interview he warned that street protests against Milosevic would not lead very far without a united strategy for replacing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned that because of the war crimes charges Milosevic faces, he would be unlikely to give in to demands for his resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Avramovic said the only way Milosevic might agree to stand aside would be if he were given some form of guarantee he would not end up before the UN war crimes tribunal in the Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prospects the Western alliance might agree to such a guarantee seem remote. Whether Serbia's opposition leaders would be inclined to offer Milosevic such protection is also doubtful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That leaves him with a very strong motive for retaining power, and using whatever means he has to.</SPAN></P>

The demonstration was announced by Mr Mladjan Dinkic (35), leader of the Group 17 organisation of independent Yugoslav economists. He hopes to bring together the two main opposition figures, Mr Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mr Zoran Djindjic of Serbia's Democratic party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fifteen Serbian opposition parties yesterday chose the nationalist leader of the Democratic party of Serbia as their candidate to run in September against the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We unanimously decided to name Vojislav Kostunica as our joint candidate,&quot; Dusan Mihajlovic, leader of the New Democracy party, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party officials met in Belgrade to make their decision after crisis talks with the biggest opposition party, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO), which had nominated its own candidate on Sunday despite appeals not to risk splitting the opposition vote by going its own way.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SPO leader, Vuk Draskovic, said that he had not changed his mind about his candidate, the Belgrade mayor Vojislav Mihajlovic, who the rest of the opposition fear will split the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vote in the September 24 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Kostunica, chosen by the other parties because his nationalism reflects popular opinion in Serbia, yesterday abandoned his acceptance condition that Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller republic, would stop its boycott of the vote. The public was expecting him to run, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A recent opinion poll gave Mr Kostunica greater popularity than President Milosevic, while the Belgrade mayor backed by Vuk Draskovic has not even appeared on pollsters' lists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democratic party leader, Zoran Djindjic, said Mr Draskovic would not discuss a joint candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Mihajlovic said that Mr Draskovic's insistence on his own presidential runner meant that he could not join their candidate lists for local elections, also due September 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We unanimously supported the idea of going together with SPO to all elections, but after the SPO came out with its separate presidential candidate, we decided that a coalition is impossible at one level if there is competition at another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Djindjic said Mr Kostu nica's advantage was that he could travel to Montenegro and Kosovo, whereas Mr Milosevic could not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Montenegro's pro-western authorities have agreed to cooperate with the UN war crimes tribunal. It has indicted Mr Milosevic for war crimes committed by Serb forces last year in Kosovo before Nato bombing forced the withdrawal of the Yugoslav army from the province, which mainly ethnic Albanian .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our candidate can go everywhere,&quot; Mr Djindjic said. &quot;And where can Mr Milosevic go? To his bunker. Well, let him win in his bunker; we will win in Serbia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the right, meanwhile, the ultra-nationalist Radical party has proposed Tomislav Nikolic, its vice-president and Yugoslav deputy prime minister, as its presidential candidate for September. Reuters</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Misha Savic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Belgrade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YUGOSLAV'S top general has labelled increasingly vocal opponents of President Slobodan Milosevic as traitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accusation comes amid growing infighting on the part of opposition leaders seeking to oust Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who call for a forceful ouster of the legally elected authorities . . . cannot count on people's support,&quot; General Dragoljub Ojdanic, the army chief of staff, said in remarks published on Sunday by the pro-government daily Politika.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement was his first since opposition leaders began organising </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies nearly three weeks ago, trying to capitalise on discontent spurred by the country's recent defeat by NATO and de-facto loss of Kosovo province to NATO troops and its ethnic Albanian majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbs regard Kosovo as the medieval birthplace of their state, though 90 percent of its present population is ethnic Albanian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the task of us all now to preserve the stability of the country because there are many sold souls, Western vassals, who want to take power by force and take the country into a new catastrophe,&quot; Gen Ojdanic said. &quot;But they won't have any support from our people.&quot; The general is one of five top officials, including Milosevic, indicted on war crimes charges by an international tribunal for alleged atrocities in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daily protests against Milosevic and his government have spread over much of Serbia, mostly organised by an opposition coalition known as Alliance for Change. But one prominent opposition politician has stayed out of the mainstream </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and yesterday launched his own, separate push to oust Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, head of Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke to a 15,000-strong crowd of supporters in the central Serbian town of Kragujevac, demanding Milosevic's resignation but at the same time distancing himself from other opposition leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While outlining essentially the same demands as the rest of opposition, Mr Draskovic accused the other leaders of radicalism and of risking a civil war in Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Draskovic has vacillated between alliance with the opposition and co-operation with Milosevic. After leading some of the strongest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests in the past, Mr Draskovic briefly served as deputy Yugoslav premier before he was fired for criticising the Government during the Kosovo conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The traditionally fractured opposition in Serbia has failed in several past attempts to topple Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with weeks of rallies by opposition supporters, there have been scattered protests by army reservists, called up during the 78-day NATO air-strike campaign and the escalated fighting against armed ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The reservists demand to be paid for their service in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the southern city of Nis, about 100 reservists demonstrated for a third consecutive day yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They later decided to suspend their protest and see if the army would deliver on its promise to pay them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of their representatives, Miodrag Stankovic, threatened &quot;much more radical protests&quot; if their demands were not met.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IF HIS face gives the appearance of having been smashed repeatedly into a brick wall this is because it once was, on the orders of the man against whom he has just seriously reoffended. Having already been tortured by Slobodan Milosevic's special police, Vuk Draskovic will be feeling nervous about what retribution he might face this time for his rebelliousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic, the former Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister, has just been sacked by President Milosevic for offences that one hardline member of government described as treasonable. Is he brave or crazy? A bit of both, say those who know him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Draskovic was sacked, NATO leaders saw hope in his conciliatory public statements. They thought Draskovic may be acting as a message carrier from Milosevic, putting out feelers for a political dialogue to resolve the conflict.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Milosevic killed this hope by dumping Draskovic they said it showed cracks were beginning to develop in the Serb leadership and that Draskovic's dissent was a symptom of Serbian people's growing weariness with the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if NATO is now waiting to see a dissent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> form around Draskovic, and for this to help speed the end of the war, it is making yet another misjudgment about the internal affairs of Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Draskovic's actions have created discussion of issues that were not being discussed previously. But Draskovic is too damaged to be a leader of any dissent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and NATO's bombing campaign has made Milosevic stronger than he has ever been. I don't believe he is under any serious internal pressure to cave in to NATO's demands,&quot; one observer of Belgrade politics said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of a dissident </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> emerging to challenge Milosevic's leadership is attractive to NATO. Without internal pressure there is no reason for Milosevic to negotiate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ball is in NATO's court, and, if it is also not prepared to compromise - which it insists it will not - its only option is the military one. And unless it is prepared to mount a ground force invasion - which it also insists it has no intention of doing - it is stuck with no alternative but to continue the air campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just as NATO's belief that Milosevic would agree to negotiate after the first few bombs fell proved to be wishful thinking so, it seems, is the idea of an internal uprising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spotlight that fell this week on Draskovic exposed the opposite of what NATO thought it saw: It revealed just how tragically threadbare are the opposition forces to Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The disastrous thing about the future outlook for politics in Belgrade is that Vuk Draskovic is probably the best alternative leader available. He is half mad, untrustworthy, has no consistent set of beliefs or objectives and is probably corrupt,&quot; said someone who once worked with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe there is any prospect of Vuk being able to rally the people to challenge Milosevic. He might have been able to do that a few years ago, but he betrayed us and our hopes for democracy.&quot; There are a lot of pro-democracy, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> people in Belgrade who blame Draskovic as much as they blame Milosevic for the fact that their country is now at war with the free world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, as leader of the largest opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Party, Draskovic joined with other opposition figures to form the &quot;Zajedno&quot; (Together) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coalition. The coalition contested local government elections and won sweeping victories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic claimed the election results were rigged and attempted to annul them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgraders took to the streets in protest, and for more than 80 successive days, they staged marches and rallies in the city centre. Crowds of 100,000 and more turned out. Draskovic led and his followers chanted &quot;Vuk, Vuk, Vuk&quot;. It was a heady chant - Vuk means wolf in Serbo-Croatian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at one of these rallies, one of Draskovic's supporters saw something that dismayed her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The students had organised a rally at which they did not want to have any politicians speak. They wanted it to be a statement from the students, not a platform for the politicians to make speeches. Vuk and Danicsa (his wife) arrived. He wanted to speak, but was told this was not possible. Danicsa went crazy. `Who do you think you are stopping my husband speaking? He is much more important than any of you'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She told one of his bodyguards to push away the students, who were blocking his way, which they did very roughly, and he got up and spoke. I could see he wasn't really so different to Milosevic and she was like Mira Markovic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic's party was committed to free enterprise, Westminster-style democracy, restoration of community values, and to taking Yugoslavia into the European mainstream, including aiming for membership of the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic was a monarchist who advocated the return of the Serbian royal family and a nationalist with a deep emotional attachment to Serb culture, but he strongly opposed the militaristic nationalism of Milosevic. This opposition landed him and Danicsa in jail in 1993 at the height of the war in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both were tortured, and Danicsa was forced to watch as Vuk had his face repeatedly smashed into the wall of his cell. They were freed after they went on a hunger strike. Milosevic had feared they might become martyrs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its democratic platform, when the party took control of the Studio B television station in Belgrade, Draskovic fired all staff members who were not party supporters. Still, Studio B did become an alternative voice to the propaganda-filled Serbian state media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The powerful political ambition of Draskovic and his wife that was revealed at the student rally in 1996 set him on a collision course with other key opposition figures who had joined with him to form Zajedno.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He fell out with Zoran Djindjic and Vesna Pesic, the other two most influential pro-democracy politicians, and the coalition fell apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The splintering of the opposition allowed Milosevic to play his opponents off against each other. When Milosevic switched from the presidency of Serbia to the presidency of Yugoslavia in 1997, the Opposition squabbled about who should oppose him in the presidential election. Draskovic ran and split the opposition vote, allowing Milosevic to win comfortably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Milosevic reasserted his political dominance Draskovic faded from prominence for a while, pursuing instead his other career as a writer. The chain-smoking former hope of the democracy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> turned instead to the security situation in Kosovo. Draskovic shared the prejudices of many Serbs against ethnic Albanians (prejudices reciprocated by the ethnic Albanians). One of his novels, a best-seller, depicts ethnic Albanian Muslims as criminals. He also wrote of the threat posed to Serbia by the population growth of ethnic Albanians and advocated a system of taxes to impose big penalties on couples with more than four children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic publicly backed Milosevic's hard line against the ethnic Albanian separatists, a stand which further disillusioned his former supporters. Then in January this year, as NATO intensified it threats to bomb Serbia if Milosevic did not withdraw his forces from Kosovo and make a political deal with the ethnic Albanians giving Kosovo autonomy, Draskovic accepted an offer from Milosevic to join the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister, a move that allowed Milosevic to prove Serbs were united behind him on his Kosovo strategy and to use Draskovic's links with the West to give the impression of being willing to maintain a dialogue about the future of Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is not the slightest doubt that Vuk allowed himself to be used by Milosevic,&quot; said one diplomat. &quot;He saw the chance to get the access to power that he had always wanted, decided that Serb solidarity over Kosovo was a good cover for his ambition, and he sold out for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the politician who had been the great hope of Yugoslav democrats went and sat at the same Cabinet table as the brutal dictator who ordered his torture six years earlier and his former mortal political enemy, the ultra-nationalist leader of the Serb Radical Party, Vojislav Seselj. He seemed not to find this too uncomfortable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I saw him in Belgrade just after the NATO bombing started. He and Danicsa were at one of the daily rallies in the main city square, in the company of the indicted Bosnian war crimes suspect Arkan and his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Draskovic's decision this week to warn that Serbia could not win the war with NATO, accuse the state media of lying to the Serb people, and suggest that the leadership would have to accept an armed international peacekeeping force in Kosovo, was an attempt to rescue some of his credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps he believed he should try to position himself for the opportunities that might develop should Milosevic lead his country to complete collapse and total military defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that it is now clear he was not speaking with any authority from Milosevic, and given that there is no evidence of any significant internal dissent, there seems to be no other logical explanation for saying things that virtually guaranteed he would be dismissed and putting himself at real physical risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, the diplomat said, if that was his plan he was as deluded about his ambition as NATO was about his dissenting voice representing a serious challenge to Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no future with any of the current party leaders,&quot; he said. &quot;The best the people can hope for is that the current crop are swept away by the war and a whole new generation replaces it. Until that happens I think the prospects for the Serb people are going to be bleak.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KRAGUJEVAC: Thousands of Serbs demonstrated massive support for opposition leader Vuk Draskovic when they turned out yesterday for yet another </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally in Kragujevac, about 120km south of Belgrade, followed a massive protest rally against Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That rally was organised by a coalition of opposition groups which Mr Draskovic has refused to join.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday's rally, led by by former Belgrade mayor Zoran Djindjic, was also in Kragujevac and attracted about 10,000 people. Yesterday's rally, in the city's central square, was attended by about 15,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Draskovic has refused to join forces with Mr Djindjic's coalition, called Alliance for Changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's rally was the first organised by Mr Draskovic's party, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which had previously rejected street protests as a way to oust Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After all (the) misfortunes that have happened to this nation in the last 10 years, and especially after the Kosovo shame and pain, all reasons order the first man of this state, the President of Yugoslavia, to step down,&quot; Mr Draskovic told supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The SPO wants and demands this resignation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few policemen attended the rally, but reporters were stopped and briefly checked by a police patrol on a road leading to the city, which has a population of 170,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally began with the old Serbian national hymn, God Give Us Justice, sung by a church choir, after which a minute of silence was held &quot;for all those who gave their lives in the latest unfortunate war&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tribute was followed by protesters shouting: &quot;Slobo, you have betrayed Kosovo&quot;, referring to the Belgrade troops' withdrawal and the ensuing Serb exodus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters waved Serbian and party flags, while a huge placard saying &quot;One for all,&quot; with Mr Draskovic's photo, covered the first rows, as some demonstrators carried torches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests came as the United Nations war crimes tribunal's appeals court said it could bring new charges against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for his role in Bosnia's 1992-95 war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I certainly expect that our ongoing investigations in Kosovo may lead to expanded charges against the persons who are currently indicted,&quot; tribunal chief prosecutor Louise Arbour said yesterday at the end of a three-day visit to Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic and four associates already have been indicted for war crimes in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pristina, a KFOR spokesman said peacekeeping troops had discovered what appeared to be a mass grave. Thirty bodies were exhumed yesterday by soldiers from the Kosovo Liberation Army in the British sector north-east of Pristina.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIONEER PARK in central Belgrade has taken on the appearance of a film set for a low-budget Balkan war movie: men dressed in the uniforms of a king's army idle beside their khaki-coloured tanks, rousing martial music blares out of a loudspeaker and kitsch portraits of the Serbian royal family hang from trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For much of the last week, as Belgrade showed its ambivalence about supporting anti-government demonstrations, the 300 monarchists in the park - a mix of Serbian irregulars, peasants and factory workers - never faltered in their determination to see the fall of the authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of them support the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO) the main force behind Depos, an alliance of opposition parties and political associations calling for Serbia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, to go.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Depos rally outside parliament got off to a less than auspicious start eight days ago when only 60,000 people turned out to witness a spectacle of the heir to the Serbian throne and the Orthodox church's patriarch backing the alliance's demands. The organisers had predicted half a million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the capital's mood one of resignation, people trickled to the rally over the next few days, leaving speakers with little more than the Pioneer Park royalists as an audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a final SPO rallying call brought 100,000 people - including republicans, nationalists and monarchists - marching through the streets and the procession has been repeated night after night, with new groups joining in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the weekend about 500 smartly dressed doctors and nurses headed for Belgrade television, seen as the president's main propaganda tool. Hundreds of heavily armed police, supported by armoured personnel carriers and fire engines with water cannon, waited for orders to intervene should the rally get out of hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sitting outside his tent in Pioneer Park, Dragan Jokic, a student aged 24, from the Serbian copper mining town of Bor, said: &quot;If Slobo doesn't leave, the UN will not lift its sanctions - that will be a disaster for Serbia.&quot; He predicted that even those who support the president will start turning against him. &quot;When people haven't enough money to buy food they'll come to Belgrade in their millions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic has so far managed to stem discontent outside the capital by guaranteeing that the state will buy this year's harvest at higher than average prices, and ensuring that factory workers sacked because of lost orders continue to receive their pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Depos knows that it has yet to win overwhelming support, it - like Dragan in the park - believes that soon the authorities will be hard pressed to offset the impact of sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When the fuel runs out and we don't have enough chemicals to make the water clean for drinking, Milosevic will be in real trouble,&quot; said Ilija Radulovic, a senior SPO official. &quot;Once the people start suffering they won't have time for his lies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia Serbia's largest opposition party Sunday nominated its own candidate to oppose Slobodan Milosevic in September elections, ignoring appeals to rally behind a common standard-bearer and bolstering chances the autocratic president will hold onto power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nominated Belgrade's opposition mayor, Vojislav Mihailovic, to run for president of Yugoslavia. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had previously said it would boycott the Sept. 24 presidential and local elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's other opposition groups have said they will support a common candidate to oust Milosevic, and the decision by the larger Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will likely mean a split opposition vote and possibly victory for Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement released after a meeting of its ruling board on Sunday, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demanded the other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parties support Mihailovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope that those parties will not boycott our presidential candidate, a candidate of the largest opposition party, or nominate someone else just to prevent his victory,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serb opposition parties had scheduled negotiations for today on the candidate issue but the talks were called off, said Zoran Djinjic of the Democratic Party, the second-largest opposition group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest of the opposition is expected to support Vojislav Kostunica, leader of the small, center-right Democratic Party of Serbia. Kostunica has not agreed yet to run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica said Sunday he will accept the candidacy only if the pro-Western administration in Montenegro, which with much larger Serbia forms the Yugoslavian federation, participates in the balloting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans to take part in presidential and local elections, it has said it would participate in the parliamentary ballot only if the pro-Western Montenegrin parties do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the government of Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic has refused to take part in the elections, despite pressure from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials fear Milosevic might use lack of cooperation as a pretext to try to oust Djukanovic and intervene militarily in Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the pro-Western parties abstain, Milosevic's supporters in Montenegro, who make up roughly half of that republic's 600,000 people, could secure a majority in the federal parliament.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's possibly even more nationalist than Milosevic, yet Vojislav Kostunica may yet be ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOJISLAV Kostunica is one of the gloomiest men I know. This may be an advantage for a new president of whatever remains of Yugoslavia. Even if the miracle happens and Slobodan Milosevic goes without bloodshed, gloom will still be in order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;new&quot; Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will have a ruined economy, like Romania after 1989; a burden of guilt, like Germany after 1945; ubiquitous corruption, like Russia today; and still unresolved ethnic-territorial issues, like, well, old Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who is the leader upon whom such a heavy burden may fall? A large man, quiet-spoken, painstakingly analytical, Dr Vojislav Kostunica (pronounced Kosh-TOON-it-sa) talks more like an academic than a politician. Until 10 years ago, he was just that a politically engaged constitutional lawyer and political scientist. Now 56, he has been an active party politician only since the age of 45, when non-communist party politics became possible in 1989.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first time we met, at the time of the last great </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations, in 1996-97, he took me to an old-fashioned restaurant in central Belgrade and told me that he really believed in Yugoslavia. The original Yugoslavia, that is, the Serb-dominated unitary kingdom between the two world wars. (His father was an officer in its royal army.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was, he said, or should have been, an exercise in British-style nation-building under a constitutional monarchy. Look how the King had given his first son a Serb name, his second a Croatian name and his third a Slovenian one rather as British monarchs deliberately called their heir the Prince of Wales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the other nationalities of former Yugoslavia would find that a very rose-tinted view. But no, he didn't believe in the restoration of the monarchy. The pretender to the throne, Prince Alexander, barely speaks Serbian, he said. Now he believed in the need for &quot;asymmetric federalism&quot; as a solution for Kosovo, Montenegro and Vojvodina, and perhaps also for the Serb Republic in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he explained to me at length his plans for the &quot;regionalisation&quot; of Yugoslavia. At rather boring length, I must say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Kostunica is a very serious man. Solid. Consistent. Knowledgeable and capable of sophisticated rational argument. Principled, too. But hardly a bundle of fun. Short on charisma. Nor is he a great believer in the politics of the street. That time, he told me how he saw unhappy echoes of 1968 in the street demonstrators cult of spontaneity, their belief in &quot;the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; as an end in itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the man whose future, and with it the future of all south-eastern Europe, now depends on his ability to lead a peaceful, inventive, effective </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of mass protest and civil disobedience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late 1998, we talked in the office of his tiny opposition party, the Democratic Party of Serbia. His spartan offices seemed virtually empty, as if a removals van was about to arrive. Under the harsh neon light, the talk was all of Kosovo, and how its future inside Serbia must be secured by constitutional, peaceful means. Ordinary, decent Serbians would be dismayed at what Milosevic was doing there, he said. In an election held under supervision of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Milosevic could be defeated. Fat chance, I thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year later, after the war and the NATO bombing, which he criticised fiercely, the office seemed even more spartan and bare. Other opposition politicians clearly had plenty of money from somewhere and Belgrade gossip would soon tell you from where but not Serbia's Dr K.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, he was furious with the United States, and with Britain. &quot;Blair! Cook!&quot; he spat out the names with contempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he went on, &quot;I know they are not the West. Fortunately, there is also Simon Jenkins [the London Times columnist who criticised the Kosovo war], Henry Kissinger [whom he clearly took to be another war critic], Noam Chomsky and Harold Pinter!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, as our papers say, a &quot;moderate nationalist?&quot; Well, what is a moderate nationalist? Some old Yugoslav hands, shocked by his strong support for the Bosnian and Kosovo Serbs, say he is as bad as Milosevic. Some even say he is more deeply nationalist than the post-communist opportunist Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is both true and completely false. It's true that he has been more seriously and consistently concerned about the fate of the Serbian nation than Milosevic. That is one of the reasons he was purged from Belgrade University in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other, happier places and times he would be a conservative, romantic patriot, of the kind frequently encountered in the British Conservative Party (and it has some pretty rose-tinted views of the national past, too). In this unhappy place and time, he has said and done things he should regret: being photographed holding an automatic weapon among Kosovo Serbs, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I have no doubt that he is genuinely moderate and what matters is his moderation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difference between him and Milosevic is that between day and night. This is not just because Kostunica is supported by a coalition of less nationalist democrats. It's because he is himself, in his whole style and intellectual formation, profoundly committed to civilised, peaceful, constitutional means. And one lesson of Europe's terrible 20th century is that the means you embrace are as important as the ends. Perhaps more important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a man who is passionate about the rule of law, who believes in elections, institutions, negotiations. He is also a man who, precisely because he is a Serbian patriot or nationalist sees that the only future for his country lies in a return to Europe. Whether he can become a popular leader of a peaceful, negotiated revolution, we shall see. But human beings can grow with a great challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made a fine beginning at the post-election victory rally last week. Addressing his &quot;dear, brave fellow citizens, free people&quot;, he said: &quot;We are fighting for democracy and democracy is based on truth, not on lies. The truth is that we have won this election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mentioning the support of Russia and the European Union but pointedly not the US he promised a country &quot;in which only the will of the people and the law will be sacred&quot;. Then he addressed a skilful message to rank-and-file members of Milosevic's Socialist party: &quot;We will not act as did your leaders: we will not hound people who have opposing opinions; we will not burst into other people's houses ... we will not remove the property of the people from the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an equally dignified but conciliatory appeal to the police and army, he concluded, &quot;We will defend the country, we will defend ourselves, because we have freed ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History makes the most unlikely heroes. Serbia's Dr K may yet be one.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the people's revolution was triumphing in Yugoslavia, Serbs in Australia disputed how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the local community has been.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Predrag Vucinic, who says he is the local representative of Mr Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia, accused Serbs in Australia of failing previously to support the democratic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr George Marinkovic, founder and publisher of The Serbian Voice, a twice-weekly paper distributed throughout Australia, said this was &quot;completely wrong&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Vucinic, who came to Australia eight years ago and now lives in Canberra, said there were about 100,000 Serbs in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbian organisations had often demonstrated against the Western powers and even the Australian Government, but any demonstrations against Milosevic had been very small.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that when he had made </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> statements on radio while living in Melbourne, many Serbs had called saying, &quot;How can you say such things against our president?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he came to Australia, the Democratic party had given him permission to be its representative and try to establish a branch. &quot;But because support was so strong for Milosevic I wasn't able to establish a successful branch here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He predicted that many Serbs who had backed Milosevic would now try to say they had been supporters of the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Marinkovic said local Serbs had demonstrated against Milosevic, he being one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, yesterday said he would send a message to the Russian President, Mr Vladimir Putin, asking him &quot;to exercise the undoubted influence he has on President Milosevic to urge a peaceful surrender of power and authority&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KRAGUJEVAC, Yugoslavia -- Despite protests and petitions calling<BR>for the ouster of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, there<BR>is a growing sense here that he will not be forced to resign anytime<BR>soon -- if at all.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's looking bleaker every day,&quot; said Miroslav Djankovic, 44,<BR>an unemployed autoworker. &quot;There's a lot of hype but no clear<BR>answer in sight.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apathy was evident over the weekend when only 15,000 of the<BR>168,000 people in this southern Serbian city showed up for the<BR>first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally by Vuk Draskovic, the charismatic opposition<BR>leader of the Serbian Renewal Party. Up to 50,000 people had been<BR>expected.<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other protests in the Serbian cities of Leskovac and Kraljevo<BR>also have fizzled despite repeated calls for large turnouts.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reasons are clear: Serbia's already fragmented opposition<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is growing further apart than ever, and Milosevic is<BR>moving quickly to consolidate his power.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyone who thinks this is the beginning of the end needs to<BR>hold his tongue,&quot; independent political analyst Predrag Simic<BR>said. &quot;Let's be realistic: The opposition is too weak to take<BR>advantage of the situation, and Milosevic is not going to step<BR>down and feed the pigeons in the park.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To quell rising discontent, Milosevic on Sunday began paying thousands<BR>of Yugoslav army reservists who have been protesting for back<BR>wages. The soldiers, who had been seen by opposition leaders as<BR>key to forcing Milosevic to resign, immediately called off their<BR>demonstrations.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has just lost its support,&quot; Gen. Dragoljub<BR>Ojdanic, the army's chief of staff, said in an interview. &quot;We're<BR>confident now that our soldiers and police do not want to be part<BR>of their civil war for change. They're placid now, and we expect<BR>them to stay that way.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a clear sign of support for Milosevic, Ojdanic also warned<BR>in public remarks that opposition leaders who demand the president's<BR>ouster are risking a &quot;new catastrophe&quot; and &quot;cannot count on<BR>people's support.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Ojdanic's first public statement since opposition leaders<BR>began organizing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies just over two weeks ago.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the task of us all now to preserve the stability of the<BR>country because there are many sold souls, Western vassals, who<BR>want to take power by force and take the country into a new catastrophe.<BR>But they won't have any support from our people,&quot; he said.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appeared to be referring to Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic<BR>and other opposition leaders who have been organizing near-daily<BR>rallies against Milosevic.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ojdanic also praised his troops for their &quot;great contribution<BR>in defending freedom, honor and dignity of our country in the<BR>recent NATO aggression.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general is one of five top government officials, including<BR>Milosevic, indicted on war crimes charges by an international<BR>tribunal in connection with atrocities against ethnic Albanians<BR>in Kosovo.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Milosevic aides said Sunday that the president<BR>was rewriting election laws that would replace the current proportional<BR>representation system, which tended to favor small opposition<BR>parties, with a new, unspecified program that would favor larger<BR>ones.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To exploit the change, his Socialist Party is expected to link<BR>up with the Yugoslav Left Party headed by Milosevic's wife, Mira<BR>Markovic, and with the Serbian Radical Party of ultra-nationalist<BR>Vojislav Seselj to form a new, larger voting bloc. He then could<BR>call for early elections in October that could shut out opposition<BR>groups that now control many small Serbian towns, Draskovic aides<BR>said.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Milosevic, although under enormous pressure, intends to fight<BR>for his presidency,&quot; Belgrade's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">VIP News Report </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">quoted<BR>Milosevic aides as saying. &quot;The opposition and the people are<BR>not going to win.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic, in an apparent attempt to court Milosevic's government,<BR>told protesters this weekend that it was &quot;not necessary&quot; to<BR>call for the Yugoslav president to step down immediately.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, he said a transitional government should be set up under<BR>Milosevic to end economic sanctions against the country. He also<BR>urged protesters to &quot;forgive&quot; and &quot;reconcile&quot; with Milosevic<BR>supporters.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic, who has shifted his alliances between the opposition<BR>and Milosevic's government, then went on to blast other opposition<BR>leaders in the umbrella group Alliance for Change.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, which blames Milosevic for the country's international<BR>isolation and shattered economy, has spearheaded the demonstrations<BR>and petitions across the country that have called for his ouster.<BR>More protests are planned.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't need daily rallies. We don't need petitions. We need<BR>reconciliation,&quot; Draskovic told the stunned crowd. &quot;Don't waste<BR>your time with them. It is time to forgive.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters at the weekend rally, many of whom arrived ready to<BR>join a national uprising to oust Milosevic, walked out halfway<BR>through Draskovic's speech, saying they were disillusioned. Several<BR>were crying.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others across the country echoed similar feelings Sunday. Many<BR>said they no longer would participate in the protests because<BR>it would do little good unless the opposition is united.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Milosevic can sleep comfortably now,&quot; says Svetlana Maslarovic,<BR>31, a Belgrade secretary. &quot;He knows this is the greatest opportunity<BR>we've had to overthrow him, and it looks like we're about to blow<BR>it.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Serbia, Aug. 19</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tens of thousands of people gathered on a hot night in front of the Federal Parliament to demand the resignation of President Slobodan Milosevic, but they heard an extremely mixed set of messages from rival leaders of the democratic opposition here on how to get the job done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A crowd of at least 50,000 people -- some estimates exceeded 100,000 -- represented the largest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally since NATO's air war against Yugoslavia, which forced Belgrade's troops out of Kosovo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the opposition's rivalries and clashing strategies were also on display, with the drama of the night being the effort of Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the largest party in the opposition, to hijack a rally he had sworn he would not attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a clumsy bit of political fakery booed by many in the crowd, Mr. Draskovic, who had withdrawn his name from the list of speakers, essentially crashed the rally, coming on stage surrounded by bodyguards, in response, he said, to the demands of his supporters in the crowd. His ploy was an almost exact re-creation of a sudden appearance by Mr. Milosevic at a rally on the same spot 10 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Draskovic was almost forced by the size of the turnout to attend, he also criticized many of the ideas of other opposition leaders, saying that early elections under fair conditions were the only sensible way to change Serbia and finally oust Mr. Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic commands more voters than any other opposition politician, up to 18 percent of the vote in recent polls, more than those who favor the parties of Mr. Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic, combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition politicians had been wary of calling a rally in sophisticated Belgrade, where huge street protests against Mr. Milosevic in 1996 and 1997 failed to bring him down. But the numbers tonight were enough to give the opposition a lift, despite its divisions, showing the disgust of many people at their current isolation and poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the people are also disillusioned by the divisions among opposition leaders, they said, and those were on clear display.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizers of the rally -- the Serbian Orthodox Church and Group 17, a confederation of economists and professionals -- are calling for Mr. Milosevic to resign and appoint a transitional Government of experts to serve for a year and then organize new elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leader of the Democratic Party, Zoran Djindjic, Mr. Draskovic's prime rival, called for Mr. Milosevic and the Government to resign within 15 days or face mass protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they are still there after 15 days then Serbia will go out into the streets, not only in Belgrade, but in all towns, in 50 towns on the same day,&quot; Mr. Djindjic said. &quot;Everybody will go out into the streets with one single message -- we will stay here until you go. It's either Milosevic or Serbia, there can be no third solution. This time we will go to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Draskovic heaped scorn on the idea of a transitional government of experts -- &quot;of people no one had heard of a week ago&quot; -- and said that it was clear now that Mr. Milosevic would never agree to it. Mr. Draskovic also scoffed at the idea of a new Government formed in the streets, through civil unrest, saying: &quot;It's dust in the eyes of the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic called for early elections in November, as Mr. Milosevic's spokesmen are themselves suggesting, in their own effort to divide the opposition, but then urged street pressure to insure early elections if Mr. Milosevic does not grant them. And he called on &quot;all responsible leaders of the opposition&quot; to support his ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One speaker for the Alliance for Change called for a new demonstration in Belgrade on Aug. 28, while another, for the Group 17, called for a new demonstration here on Sept. 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaving the rally, Zoran Stankovic said: &quot;The only real message is change. It's time for this Government to go.&quot; But he said Mr. Milosevic could only benefit &quot;when the opposition leaders speak in so many voices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One important political leader of the Alliance for Change coalition, Nenad Canak, leader of the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina, said in an interview: &quot;The rally was fine concerning the number of people and their energy. But it was not O.K. in terms of the absence of vision, of how to focus this energy in a serious way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the rally gathered, Government officials continued to float the idea of early Serbian elections, perhaps as early as the first week of November, creating further divisions among the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alliance for Change is not ready for elections and not especially eager for them, so the Government would be calling their bluff. Mr. Draskovic, however, favors early elections to capitalize on better polling numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But new elections would not affect the position of Mr. Milosevic, whose single, four-year term as Yugoslav President runs through July 2001. While the opposition is calling for his resignation or removal, early elections may divert the population from that goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Normally elections for the Serbian parliament and municipalities would take place in 2001, while federal parliamentary elections would take place in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be difficult for the self-styled &quot;democratic opposition&quot; to oppose new elections, though its leaders would like any vote to be supervised by outside observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and would also like to see freer, more open news media, especially television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Elections are the best way to sober political drunks,&quot; Mr. Milosevic's party spokesman, Ivica Dacic, said today. &quot;Our stand is that there are many more important things than elections. But if the other political parties say elections are necessary we are ready to go to elections. But they want to come to power without elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vojislav Seselj, leader of the ultranationalist Radical Party that now helps rule both Serbia and Yugoslavia, said separately today that he favored early elections to resolve Serbia's post-Kosovo troubles. He said there was no agreement with other ruling parties to call them but there was a deal to hold them if the opposition wanted them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are even going so far as to say, 'Let the opposition parties name a date for the elections and we will call them,' &quot; he said. Mr. Seselj then, impishly, suggested that local elections come first -- since the opposition has its only power base in cities across Serbia won in local elections in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They took their seats only after street protests against election fraud forced Mr. Milosevic to back down -- while saving his own seat, of course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic's power base is the city of Belgrade, with its powerful television station, Studio B. His rivals believe that he would do almost anything to retain the station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So to divide the opposition further, Government officials leaked a story that Mr. Draskovic had met Mr. Milosevic secretly on Monday to discuss early elections and to agree not to speak at the rally. Mr. Draskovic angrily denied the entire story, as did his top aides, one of whom said &quot;it would be idiotic&quot; to have had such a meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic aides suggested that the leak was from Mr. Djindjic. Whatever the truth, the leak succeeded in further poisoning the relationship, if that were possible, between Mr. Draskovic and Mr. Djindjic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Milosevic is a master political tactician,&quot; said one senior Alliance official sadly. &quot;He's great at changing the subject and buying time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, early elections are a serious risk for Mr. Milosevic. The Government, whose support is weak after the loss of Kosovo, could lose its majority in the Serbian parliament if the opposition could ever mount a united, professional campaign. And there is reliably said to be a debate inside the Government about the wisdom of early elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some senior Government officials expressed confidence privately today that they would win a majority or could create one, despite all their problems, while some senior opposition officials also believe, with despair, that Mr. Milosevic, his wife and Mr. Seselj could retain power in a coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waiting longer, until winter bites hard and the country is inevitably short of heat and electricity due to inefficiency, sanctions and NATO air strikes, could only harm the Government's standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government had made various efforts, both subtle and crude, to cut down the size of the rally. On Wednesday night, state television announced the arrest of a Montenegrin man possessing &quot;a highly explosive device&quot; with a timer and warned of other possible bombing attacks at &quot;massive public gatherings,&quot; urging caution on citizens and on parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government ordered the payment of overdue pensions for today and moved the televising of a popular lottery program from Saturday night to tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the police did not interfere with what was a peaceful rally and were not much in evidence, though riot police were stationed in buildings should they have been needed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Belgrade keeps the hardliners, says Eve-Ann Prentice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slobodan Milosevic bolstered the power of hard-liners in Yugoslavia yesterday in a government reshuffle, which came one week before a planned anti government rally in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was said that President Milosevic had hoped to bring in politicians from across the board in an attempt to persuade the West that the new regime would be more democratic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, after six weeks of talks, opposition parties such as the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> led by Vuk Draskovic, have rejected an invitation to join the new Government. Instead, extra power has been given to the Serbian Radical Party, which is headed by the ultra-nationalist Vojislav Seselj, and the Yugoslav United Left, led by Mr Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic. Mr Seselj had vowed to leave the Government after Nato troops entered Kosovo in June.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new Government comes as plans are being finalised for what is expected to be a large </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protest in Belgrade next Thursday. The rally is being supported by the Serbian Orthodox Church, which this week renewed calls for the Yugoslav President's resignation, and by both main opposition groups, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Alliance for Change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One casualty of the reshuffle was Zoran Lilic, a Deputy Prime Minister and the Yugoslav President before Mr Milosevic took over the position two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reshuffle was seen as a move by Mr Milosevic to reinforce his power base in the face of the growing demands for his resignation. Seven ministers were dismissed and twelve brought in, including five members of the Radical Party. All the new ministers, including those with the task of dealing with the outside world, are on a European Union list of more than 300 senior officials and businessmen barred from travelling to the West, as were the ministers they replace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic yesterday addressed the new Government, saying: &quot;Our aim is to continue successfully with the process of current reforms, contribute to an accelerated pace of economic development and increase productivity and living standards.&quot; It had the opportunity of taking &quot;some effective and brave steps&quot; in the interest of all the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democratic Party described the new Government as &quot;nothing new and nothing good&quot;. It added: &quot;By this move, the regime has sent two messages. To the world it is saying: 'Forget about any co-operation with Yugoslavia.' And to its citizens it is saying they are facing a difficult winter and further impoverishment without heating and electricity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON, July 11</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its clear desire to see President Slobodan Milosevic ousted, the Clinton Administration is finding it difficult to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the opposition protests that have bubbled up across Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of new leadership in Serbia is as troubling as it is important, not only because Mr. Milosevic has been indicted on charges of war crimes, Administration officials said, but also because without the participation of Serbia, it will be hard to build a stable Balkans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But for the moment, a wait-and-see attitude prevails in Washington, even though the Clinton Administration has made clear that it considers Mr. Milosevic an international outlaw who should be brought to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main problem, Administration officials acknowledge, is that they are wary of the current slate of opposition leaders who might succeed Mr. Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the Administration had a favorite, they concede, its ability to advance that person decisively is limited. Further, after 11 weeks of NATO bombing, even tacit support from Washington might only taint a successor's standing with the Serbian public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus Administration officials say they are being careful not to back anyone in particular, and have instead decided to stick with their policy of simply trying to isolate Mr. Milosevic and generate hardship for his powerful circle of cronies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said they were disillusioned with the leaders who galvanized crowds in Belgrade against Mr. Milosevic in the winter of 1996-97.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One official said the Administration has written off as an &quot;opportunist&quot; Vuk Draskovic, one of the leaders of the 1996 street demonstrations, who then joined Mr. Milosevic in government and is now out of the government again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another leader of that period, Zoran Djindjic, who remained in opposition and hid in Montenegro during the Kosovo war, is not favored by Washington either, said a senior Administration official involved in trying to find some cohesion in the emerging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials say they believe that Mr. Djindjic lacks the necessary support and leadership skills to propel the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We shouldn't pick a winner,&quot; this official said, as he left for Europe with plans to meet some </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activists, whom he refused to identify. &quot;The Europeans are making a dramatic mistake by picking Djindjic as their poster boy. He has very little support. We should let the people pick a winner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In trying to foster an opposition to Mr. Milosevic, the Administration faces tough hurdles, some of which are an outgrowth of having just waged a war against Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States no longer has an embassy in Belgrade, and has no plans for one, according to the State Department. This makes contact with opposition-party mayors in towns where the protests have sprung up almost impossible. Even with an embassy in 1996, American officials had trouble forging links to the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A still tougher hurdle is the unusual nature of the Milosevic regime.  &quot;Mr. Milosevic is an ultra-nationalist,&quot; said James R. Hooper, executive director of the Balkan Action Council, an independent group specializing in Balkans policy. &quot;He's not a Communist like those in Eastern Europe who were held in power by the Soviet Union.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here the roots go very deep,&quot; he added. &quot;Lots of Serbs have given real or passive support. There have been few regimes like this before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The closest similarity could be made with fascist Italy or Nazi Germany, Mr. Hooper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another uncertainty is the Yugoslav Army. Mr. Milosevic has repeatedly purged its ranks, leaving his ciphers at the top. But historically, the army has been a proud institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disgruntled army reservists, talking darkly about the war in Kosovo and bitter about their lack of pay, took part in some of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies last week, particularly in Leskovac, a longtime stronghold of the Yugoslav leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what practical effect their participation would have in the coming months was difficult to judge. &quot;The Yugoslav Army does not have a history of coups,&quot; a senior Administration official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tactic most favored for encouraging the unrest appears to be isolating the Belgrade Government. With a little pressure here, a little pressure there, the hope is that Mr. Milosevic will asphyxiate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Administration is beginning to discuss how to help out some areas of Serbia where opposition party mayors are in power. Reconstruction aid has been ruled out for Serbia but humanitarian aid will be considered, President Clinton has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way to make humanitarian aid set an example against Mr. Milosevic would be to organize the restoration of power at a hospital in a municipality where the opposition is in control, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another isolation tactic is of symbolic importance. Much of Mr. Milosevic's standing with his own people was bolstered by the continual bustle of international figures who came to visit him, often on &quot;last ditch&quot; missions to warn against his policies, which would then be transformed on Serbian television into spectacles aggrandizing Mr. Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, those visits have dried up. And he, his family and his inner circle are marooned inside Serbia. Mr. Milosevic rarely traveled anyway, but now there are few places he can go, without being arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of personal annoyance to his tight-knit family -- consisting of Mr. Milosevic, his wife, Mirjana Markovic, their son, Marko, daughter in law, Milica, and daughter, Marija -- was the recent refusal by the Greek Embassy in Belgrade to grant Marko Milosevic a visa for travel to Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to accounts in Belgrade, the young Mr. Milosevic, who carries a diplomatic passport, applied for a visa to Greece after the Kosovo war. After about 10 days, according to one account, the Greek Embassy returned the passport without explanation and without a visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 300 of Mr. Milosevic's cronies, most of whom hold sizable bank accounts and property holdings abroad, are on a visa ban list created by the European Union before the NATO air strikes. Some of these people, including Bogoljub Karic, the owner of Serbian banks and a television station that toes the Milosevic political line, are getting restless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Karic is reported to have been turned back at the Serbian border with Hungary and is known to be complaining around Belgrade that he is unable to tend to his investments in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alongside its isolation strategy, the Administration is also trying to provide the Serbian opposition with some encouragement and role models for behavior. Mr. Clinton intends at the end of the month to attend a one-day jamboree planned for Sarajevo of 30 Western European and Balkan leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be a day, Administration officials predict, of grand proclamations of a new dawn for the Balkans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Absent there will be Slobodan Milosevic. Present will be Milo Djukanovic, President of Montenegro, the second-largest republic in Yugoslavia. It was Mr. Djukanovic who broke with Mr. Milosevic two years ago and received moral and financial support during the Kosovo war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days, he is the State Department's model of an opposition leader.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE YUGOSLAV government has accused the opposition leader Vuk Draskovic of being a French spy and of wanting civil war. As Mr Draskovic prepared to host a strategy meeting for opponents of President Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav Information Minister, Goran Matic, also claimed that he was merely a puppet of the US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Draskovic had several talks with the French intelligence service where he asked for money ... and in 1999 offered himself to co-operate with any foreign service for an adequate amount of money, ready to do what they expect from him,&quot; Mr Matic said. &quot;We should not be surprised if the ... meeting brings an initiative to offer Nato a partnership. This would pardon the commanders and executors of the crimes committed during the aggression against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.&quot; Mr Draskovic'saide, Predrag Simic, dismissed the allegations as &quot;scandalous&quot; and aimed at undermining today's meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government is trying to divert attention from all the tragedies and disasters in our country for which they are responsible,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic's Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO), is to lead 16 major opposition parties and groups, including the Alliance for Change, at the gathering, which will discuss how to force Mr Milosevic to call early elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SPO officials do not exclude the possibility of calling for joint mass protests, a strategy the party did not support when the Alliance started </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti -Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies last year. A spokesman for SPO, Ivan Kovacevic, said: &quot;The time has come now for all forms of battle against the regime.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He may have led his nation into three losing wars and earned indictment<BR>as a war criminal, but Milosevic also has demonstrated an uncanny<BR>instinct for political survival.<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After NATO airstrikes, Milosevic was weak and ready to fall,<BR>but the opposition wasn't ready,&quot; political commentator Bratislav<BR>Grubacic says. &quot;Milosevic doesn't have a single idea to step<BR>down. He is under no pressure internally.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one level, Yugoslavia is little changed from before the war.<BR>Electricity supplies have returned to normal. The cafes along<BR>Belgrade's main pedestrian boulevard are full, and McDonald's<BR>has even added a franchise to its local outlets.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't mean the Yugoslav leader lacks political problems.<BR>Analysts say a student-led resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called Otpor seems<BR>especially to have spooked the regime. Likewise, polling by the<BR>Medijum agency over the past year showed that 51%-59% of Serbs<BR>want Milosevic to resign.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a May survey, 62% of those queried said Serbia, which with<BR>Montenegro makes up the Yugoslav federation, is heading in the<BR>wrong direction.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not difficult to see why. Persistent gasoline shortages mean<BR>that cars wait routinely in three-block-long lines to fill up<BR>at the Jugopetrol filling station in the Novi Belgrade neighborhood.<BR>Young people at soccer games serenade one another with chants<BR>of &quot;Slobo, save Serbia and kill yourself.&quot; Goran Pitic, a prominent<BR>economist, reckons that after a decade of warfare and political<BR>turmoil, it will take Yugoslavia perhaps two decades to build<BR>its economic output back to what it was in 1989.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reminders of the NATO-Yugoslavia war over the separatist province<BR>of Kosovo linger in the devastated government buildings downtown<BR>along Kneza Milosa, which locals have nicknamed the &quot;street of<BR>death.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yugoslav Information Minister Goran Matic scoffs at the polls<BR>as &quot;foolish.&quot; He adds, &quot;We'll see in the election.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This fall, Yugoslavia is scheduled to hold elections for municipal<BR>and federal parliamentary offices. Opposition figures worry that<BR>with the United States preoccupied by a presidential campaign,<BR>Milosevic might crack down on dissent without fear of strong U.S.<BR>response.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prospects for a fair election are further clouded by:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A proposed &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; law that would allow the<BR>police to jail individuals for up to 30 days before charging them<BR>with a crime.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Ongoing strategy disputes within the habitually querulous<BR>opposition.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Indications that Montenegro's government, long at odds<BR>with Milosevic, might boycott the parliamentary contests.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several opposition parties are running on a united electoral ticket,<BR>which enjoys a solid lead over Milosevic's ruling coalition in<BR>major polls.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the largest single opposition party, the Serbian Renewal<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which has about 10% support, has quit the ticket.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a widespread assumption that the real showdown won't<BR>come until next year's elections for Serbian republic offices.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> charismatic leader,<BR>says a fair political contest is impossible. The Yugoslav president<BR>has tightened controls on universities and the independent press.<BR>Milosevic wants to use rigged elections to legitimize his rule,<BR>according to Draskovic.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major opposition worry is the proposed anti-terrorism law, which<BR>the regime says is needed to battle </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violence such<BR>as the recent shootings of prominent political figures. Opposition<BR>leaders say the measure's expansive police powers and broad definition<BR>of &quot;terrorism&quot; could herald the rise of a police state.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milan Protic, a U.S.-educated academic leading a small </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">party, says the opposition must contest the elections. &quot;We are<BR>limited to the democratic path,&quot; Protic says. &quot;We can't get<BR>into a power struggle; we do not have any power.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political skirmishing is accompanied by a striking fatalism<BR>on the opposition's part. With the prospect of being turned over<BR>by his successor to war crimes prosecutors at the Hague, Netherlands,<BR>almost no one thinks Milosevic can be dislodged peacefully:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;There is absolutely no theoretical possibility that<BR>Milosevic will lose power through elections,&quot; says Predrag Simic,<BR>an adviser for Draskovic.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;I can't imagine a normal way for him to go,&quot; says<BR>Dragan Soc, Montenegro's justice minister. &quot;He closed every door<BR>for a peaceful solution.  . . . My impression is his decision<BR>is to rule even if the cost is his life.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;I don't have any illusion that we can get rid of Milosevic<BR>without casualties,&quot; says Cedomir Jovanovic of the Democratic<BR>Party of Serbia.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who favor a regime change concede they essentially are waiting<BR>for a military coup or a deal that would send Milosevic and his<BR>powerful wife, Mira, into exile in return for immunity from war-crimes<BR>prosecution.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matic denounces such talk as &quot;ridiculous propaganda . . .<BR>clearly stupid.&quot; Officially, Washington says it won't bargain<BR>with an indicted war criminal.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic and his opponents agree on one point: Both want to see<BR>the U.S. policy of isolating Yugoslavia scrapped. A travel ban<BR>keeps the regime's government and private supporters penned inside<BR>Serbia. Financial sanctions bar Yugoslavia from accessing international<BR>credit markets.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some democracy activists say that by strangling the economy, sanctions<BR>have eviscerated the pro-democracy middle-class and given Milosevic<BR>an excuse for the many hardships of daily life.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic, meanwhile, is said to believe that any new U.S. administration<BR>might rethink its Balkans policy.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The (next) American administration -- it doesn't matter which<BR>(political party) -- can't have a worse policy than this one,&quot;<BR>Matic says. &quot;They bombed us for three months, eight years of<BR>sanctions, made Nazis out of Serbs. What else can they do? Just<BR>throw the atomic bomb?&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KRAGUJEVAC: Thousands of Serbs demonstrated massive support for opposition leader Vuk Draskovic when they turned out yesterday for yet another </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally in Kragujevac, about 120km south of Belgrade, followed a huge protest rally against Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That rally was organised by a coalition of opposition groups which Mr Draskovic has refused to join.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday's rally, led by by former Belgrade mayor Zoran Djindjic, was also in Kragujevac and attracted about 10,000 people. Yesterday's rally, in the city's central square, was attended by about 15,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Draskovic has refused to join forces with Mr Djindjic's coalition, called Alliance for Changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's rally was the first organised by Mr Draskovic's party, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which had previously rejected street protests as a way to oust Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After all (the) misfortunes that have happened to this nation in the past 10 years, and especially after the Kosovo shame and pain, all reasons order the first man of this state, the President of Yugoslavia, to step down,&quot; Mr Draskovic told supporters. &quot;The SPO wants and demands this resignation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few policemen attended the rally, but reporters were stopped and briefly checked by a police patrol on a road leading to the city, which has a population of 170,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a clear sign of support for Milosevic, the head of the Yugoslav army warned in remarks published yesterday that opposition leaders who demanded the President's ouster were risking a &quot;new catastrophe&quot; and &quot;cannot count on people's support&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement by General Dragoljub Ojdanic, the army's chief of staff, was his first since opposition leaders began organising </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general is one of five top government officials, including Milosevic, indicted on war crimes charges by an international tribunal in connection with atrocities against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests came as the United Nations war crimes tribunal's appeals court said it could bring new charges against Milosevic for his role in Bosnia's 1992-95 war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I certainly expect that our ongoing investigations in Kosovo may lead to expanded charges against the persons who are currently indicted,&quot; tribunal chief prosecutor Louise Arbour said yesterday at the end of a three-day visit to Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic and four associates already have been indicted for war crimes in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pristina, a KFOR spokesman said peacekeeping troops had discovered what appeared to be a mass grave. Thirty bodies were exhumed yesterday by soldiers from the Kosovo Liberation Army in the British sector north-east of Pristina.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PANCEVO, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Srdjan Mirkovic, a 39-year-old lawyer and democracy activist, was sworn in as mayor of this run-down industrial city in February 1997 as the result of a nationwide street uprising against Slobodan Milosevic, who was then president of Serbia. Every day for nearly three months, he had joined thousands of people in the streets of Pancevo, shouting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> slogans and accusing his government of election fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar scenes took place all across Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, after Milosevic supporters reacted to opposition election victories in dozens of towns and municipalities by announcing &quot;corrected&quot; results that kept power in the hands of the ruling Serbian Socialist Party. The street protests received worldwide coverage and were widely seen as a key moment in Yugoslavia's tortured transition from Communist dictatorship to a free-market democracy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, two years after he led the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests here, Mirkovic is organizing his fellow citizens to defend themselves in the event of NATO bombing attacks. The turbulent events of the winter of 1996-97 and the euphoria that swept Pancevo when it became clear that Milosevic had been forced to back down have been all but forgotten as residents focus their attention on a new enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody in their right mind has to be against the bombing of our cities,&quot; Mirkovic said. &quot;The longer this bombing continues, the stronger Milosevic becomes and the weaker the position of the political opposition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pancevo -- a city of 120,000 people that was a frontier post for the Austro-Hungarian Empire across the Danube River from Belgrade -- has been targeted by NATO bombs several times over the past two weeks. Targets have included a fertilizer factory, a light-aircraft plant and an important oil refinery, all situated close to residential areas. Local people say that two Pancevo residents -- 50-year-old Dusko Bogosavljev and 30-year-old Mirko Dimitrevic -- were killed during the attack on the refinery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deaths cast a pall over Pancevo. Mirkovic canceled nightly concerts he had organized to rally the population against the NATO attacks, and he is now advising residents to leave if they feel afraid. At the same time, he is warning of an &quot;ecological catastrophe&quot; if NATO bombs hit one of the large stockpiles of dangerous chemicals stored near the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pancevo residents' nerves have been rattled further by a number of recent NATO bombing accidents, including one that heavily damaged the town of Aleksinac in central Serbia last Monday, killing at least 10 people. &quot;That's the kind of mistake we are afraid of,&quot; said the mayor. &quot;A similar mistake here could cause thousands of casualties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preoccupied with their own problems, few people here seem to have much time for the agony of the ethnic Albanian refugees who have fled Kosovo or gone into hiding in the mountains since the NATO airstrikes began on March 24. They have been driven from their homes by Serb-led army, police and paramilitary forces who seem determined to alter forever the ethnic makeup of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians had outnumbered Serbs 9 to 1. The official news media here have depicted the exodus as being caused by the NATO bombing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Pancevo residents with access to Western satellite channels, such as CNN and Britain's Sky News, cannot bring themselves to condemn their own government. The televised scenes of refugees fleeing Kosovo are &quot;dreadful,&quot; said Snazena Sokolovic, who works at the oil refinery as a translator and was raised in Kosovo. She contended, however, that the situation there deteriorated sharply after NATO began its air offensive. &quot;NATO is following a strange kind of logic,&quot; she said, &quot;they say they want to stop the killing, but you don't stop killing by killing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coalition in Pancevo has a 37-28 majority on the city council. But Mirkovic and other democracy activists fear their position will be much weakened if the war ends with a tightening of Yugoslavia's international isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world's preoccupation with the plight of the Kosovo refugees strikes many Pancevo residents as hypocritical, given the fact that much less world attention was paid a quarter-million ethnic Serbs when a Croatian army offensive drove them from the Krajina region of Croatia in the summer of 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody is talking about the Serbian refugees from Croatia and Bosnia,&quot; said a Belgrade radio journalist who gave his name only as Dragan. &quot;They are just talking about Albanian refugees; it is disgusting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now at least, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> forces in Pancevo have managed to remain relatively united. Mirkovic is a member of a moderately nationalist, republic-wide party known as the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which governs here in a coalition with the pro-Western Democratic Party of Serbia. Across the republic, the political alliance that forced Milosevic to recognize the results of the local elections in Pancevo and other towns fell apart a few months later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vuk Draskovic, has now joined forces with Milosevic and was appointed a deputy prime minister in January. His longtime political rival, Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic, remains in opposition, but his standing has been severely undermined by the NATO offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The biggest loser in this war is my party,&quot; said Djindjic, who became mayor of Belgrade thanks to the opposition victory two years ago but was forced to resign within six months after a quarrel with Draskovic. &quot;Our entire political identity is closely tied to Europe and America. For most people here, Europe has become identical with NATO, which is identical with bombs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., however, that he would hold his first rally Saturday in the central Serbian town of Kragujevac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Valjevo, 72 kilometres west of the capital, Belgrade, protesters broke through a glass door and briefly occupied part of the city administration building. Police arrived and there was some scuffling as they pushed the demonstrators out of the building.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After sitting on the sidelines for weeks, Serbia's most powerful opposition leader, the charismatic and bombastic Vuk Draskovic, called on his supporters today to join him in &quot;massive rallies all over Serbia&quot; as part of the growing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public pressure on Milosevic -- which has been building since he agreed last month to withdraw Serb-led government forces from Kosovo and let NATO peacekeepers in -- is entering a new, potentially explosive stage. Opposition figures are warning darkly of a possible bloody showdown or civil war, just as Milosevic's allies are heightening their rhetoric, calling government opponents and some media figures spies, traitors and lackeys of the CIA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic, the self-styled &quot;czar of the streets,&quot; who drew tens of thousands of people into central Belgrade 2 1/2 years ago to demonstrate against the Milosevic government, had avoided overtly supporting protest rallies led by other opposition figures in several Serbian towns and cities over the past two weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said today that the wait-and-see period is over and that he is prepared to confront the Milosevic government with huge street protests beginning Saturday in the central city of Kragujevac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic's participation adds a new dimension to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> drive. His Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the second-largest party in Serbia after Milosevic's Socialist Party, controls the city government of Belgrade and, perhaps most importantly, operates an influential television station called Studio B.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this tightly controlled society, a television station can be a crucial tool of repression or of revolution. Thus far, Studio B -- like the pro-Milosevic state-run television stations -- has provided little or no coverage of demonstrations organized by other opposition leaders, but it is expected to cover Draskovic's first rally in great and sympathetic detail. Since no other opposition figure has control of a television station, the broadcast propaganda war will be fought by only two combatants, Draskovic and Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the weeks before, during and immediately after the NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia, Draskovic offered mixed signals of his political intentions. He had served for a time as a deputy premier in the Milosevic government and was critical of the NATO air campaign, but he was forced to resign after declaring publicly that Milosevic had lied to the nation by claiming that government forces were winning the war in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview today, Draskovic vowed not to repeat his mistakes of years past, when he spoke in romantic terms of a return of the Serbian monarchy -- not to rule, but as a symbol of the state. This time, he said, he is going after the votes and voices not only of his core supporters, but also of those Serbs who have supported Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike other opposition leaders, Draskovic asserted that it is not productive to threaten Milosevic and his inner circle with arrest for alleged war crimes against ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo. He said that talking about revenge and arrests was a way to lose potential supporters who have sided with Milosevic and supported his nationalist policies for the past 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By calling for anti-government demonstrations, however, Draskovic is moving toward open conflict with the Yugoslav leader -- a maneuver that could backfire if Milosevic and his government were to respond by attempting to strip his party of power in Belgrade or to seize control of its television station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, any effort to topple Milosevic could be handicapped by continued squabbling among opposition leaders. A ready illustration of this is the fact that the leader of the opposition Democratic Party, Zoran Djindjic, has also called for an anti-government demonstration in Kragujevac -- on the day before the Draskovic rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as they seek to play down their differences, Draskovic and Djindjic took shots at each other in separate interviews today. Djindjic said, nonetheless, that his party, along with other opposition groups, plans to stage up to 20 protest rallies around Serbia in coming weeks, culminating in a mass rally in Belgrade in August. Draskovic's plans also include large-scale street demonstrations in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic acknowledged that the public mistrusts all politicians and parties and simply wants someone to lead them toward change. &quot;What we have had this last 10 years,&quot; Djindjic said, referring to a decade of Milosevic's rule in Serbia and Yugoslavia, &quot;is a kind of sick political life. What the people want now most is something fresh, something that says, okay, here is the first step, and we will figure out the rest as we go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Belgrade today -- after they were blocked by police on Monday -- youthful members of the opposition group Alliance for Change began gathering signatures on a petition calling for Milosevic to step down. At a table set up on a main boulevard, thousands of people signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is my country, my city, and I think everyone should sign this paper,&quot; said Goran Djordjevic, an unemployed laborer. &quot;I say what everyone should say, that things must change, and soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Support for the effort was not unanimous, however. One of the young signature collectors, Branimir Kuzmanovic, said that several men had ripped down their signs and flags and punched two of his colleagues. &quot;But we did not want to incite them,&quot; he said. &quot;There are all sorts of lunatics now, on the left and on the right.&quot; Kuzmanovic said he just wants &quot;normal people&quot; to sign the petition. Vuk Draskovic issues a public challenge to Milosevic. (Photo ran in an earlier edition) Belgrade residents sign a petition demanding the resignation of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. &quot;I say what everyone should say, that things must change, and soon,&quot; said one of the thousands who came forward.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frustrated by high unemployment, inflation, years of political turmoil, and ruinous wars, tens of thousands of Serbs rallied last night in protests designed to topple President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across Yugoslavia, Serbs waved placards and chanted slogans, but the protests were lackluster compared with demonstrations of just a month ago, and Serbs seemed uncertain how to drive Milosevic and his cronies from power. Serbs are brimming with skepticism, and none of the disparate opposition leaders has yet captivated a nation in economic and social chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The protests are the last hope that something will change in this country,&quot; a law student, Tamara Draskovic, 22, said. &quot;But I'm not very enthusiastic. We tried rallies two years ago, and failed. I'm disappointed that the opposition leaders are not united. . . . We can't change anything if we're fighting amongst ourselves.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protest organizers said daily demonstrations would continue until Milosevic stepped down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's grip on the government, media and police has been so strong since 1989 that, even amid four lost wars and widespread public anger, the Yugoslav leader has consistently crushed dissent. The big egos and political squabbles of opposition leaders have often helped him. Political analysts have said that Milosevic's regime was severely weakened by last spring's NATO bombings, but that bickering opposition politicians failed to seize the opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alliance for Change, is headed by Zoran Djindjic, a former Belgrade mayor, and includes economists, professors and a former Yugoslav army general. The other major player, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is led by a charismatic writer, Vuk Draskovic. The two men were coalition partners three years ago, but they have become bitter enemies, and their animosities have left the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rudderless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a kind of perverse situation in which [Milosevic] is afraid of spontaneous protests from the people, but the people are afraid to do something,&quot; the general manager of the Belgrade Times news service, Bratislav Grubacic, said. &quot;You have a complete stalemate. Nobody knows what to do. Nobody knows how to take power. They're hoping some miracle of God might help us: some lone assassin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a gloomy dusk, with rock music, whistles and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> posters, 20,000 gathered in the rain in Republic Square. Traffic stopped, and police watched intently as opposition leaders took microphones, and waxed fiery in the floodlights. Similar scenes unfolded in Nis, where 10,000 turned out, and in Novi Sad, where 7,000 braved the weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers, who had hoped for much larger crowds, said rallies would be held in 30 cities and towns by the end of the week. Just a month ago, 100,000 people filled the streets of Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition leaders are hoping to rekindle revolutionary passion by adding a touch of political theater to future rallies. Some of them will feature &quot;public trials in absentia&quot; held for members of Milosevic's regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is only the beginning of a difficult struggle to free Serbia first from fear, then from the regime,&quot; Djindjic said at the rally, which was boycotted by Draskovic. &quot;Only with persistent and long-lasting peaceful protests in the streets will we be able to topple the regime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawyer, Goran Zoric, huddled under an umbrella as the Belgrade protest began. He watched people pass wearing paper masks with Milosevic's face crossed out. He did not expect to be moved by speeches and gestures. He just wanted to show his disdain for Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not here as a member of any political party. I'm here as an unhappy citizen,&quot; Zoric said, rubbing rain off his beard. &quot;It's hard to list all the mistakes Milosevic has made. We all feel endangered. . . . We've been robbed in all possible ways.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All Serbs have been battered by the collapsing economy. Unemployment is 50 percent. Hyperinflation is setting in. Grocery prices have soared by more than 20 percent in the last three weeks. And the United Nations is predicting that Yugoslavia's power plants will experience 30 percent to 50 percent shortages in electricity this winter. Humanitarian organizations are saying that many Serbs might freeze to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bankrupt Yugoslav state can no longer pay pensioners. Instead, retired schoolteachers, mill workers and bus drivers are receiving coupons to cover future electricity bills. The move is a ruse, according to pensioners, who say they need real money to buy food and clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're dealing with a regime right now whose priorities are not providing services to the people,&quot; said Stephen Tull, manager of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Belgrade. &quot;The urban poor population is really going to suffer this winter. You can see people digging through dumpsters all over Belgrade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hardships, along with the war in Kosovo and two months of NATO bombing, have embittered Serbs, but they have done little to cause hope for change. A recent poll found that only 10 percent of the population believed that the protests would bring new leadership. Forty-two percent said they expected Milosevic to remain in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We understand that people are still a bit skeptical,&quot; said Alexander Djukic, who led 88 days of failed student protests against Milosevic in the winter of 1996. &quot;Maybe they're a little disappointed with things. We made mistakes [in the earlier protests], but in the meantime we've lost so much as a people and a state. . . . At this point, political parties are not important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition organizers such as Djukic are baffled by how far Yugoslavia has drifted away from Europe and the West. The Yugoslav government now counts Libya as one of its biggest allies. And Serbian Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj recently expressed friendship with Iraq &quot;for the heroic resistance of the Iraqi people for the independence of their land and against American hegemonism as our common enemy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As rain fell harder at the rally, Branka Sandic held her husband's hand, and listened for words of courage, and demanded a better life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the desire for change,&quot; said Sandic, a pediatrician and mother of two, who earns $120 a month. &quot;The people are exhausted by the economy. There's nothing in stores. We used to travel, and now we can't. . . . Now we're in a prison, a ghetto. Nobody in the world wants to take us in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otpor - a youth and student-based activist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - has been gaining support across Serbia since it became public in November last year. It claims to have at least 20,000 members and organises protests that provoke and challenge the regime.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days many leading regime officials, including the Serbian police chief, Mr Vlajko Stoiljkovic, have branded Otpor members as &quot;terrorists&quot; and &quot;fascists&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say the decision of Mr Cosic (79) to join Otpor provides it with credibility and legitimacy because of his stature in the country. He is a renowned novelist and anti-fascist writer whose ideas have led many people to call him: &quot;father of the Serbian nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Cosic was sitting at one of his favourite restaurants in Belgrade on Tuesday morning when a student leader of Otpor, Mr Vukasin Petrovic (24), decided to approach him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said, 'Good Morning'. He immediately began praising us, saying that we were doing a good job. 'You are the future of this country', he said to us. I asked him if he would like to join, and he said, 'Yes, with pleasure',&quot; recalls Mr Petrovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Cosic later told local journalists: &quot;My decision to join Otpor is to offer human and moral support to those young people who are motivated by patriotism, democracy and civilised behaviour and who do not want to accept the system that exists at the moment, and a society without hope. I believe that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor does not only oppose the present situation but also fights for a free, prosperous and humane society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Cosic was among the authors of a memorandum written by academics of the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts in 1986. This was highly influential in fomenting nationalist thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His nationalist ideas provided a climate of opinion that Milosevic could then manipulate,&quot; says Prof Srbijanka Turajlic, a member of the Otpor Council - a group of respected advisers to the youth </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But she welcomed his membership of Otpor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many liberals will be uncomfortable with Mr Cosic's membership of Otpor, because of his close past links with Mr Milsoevic. He was president from June 1992 to June 1993, at the start of the Bosnian war when Mr Milosevic was President of Serbia and some believe Mr Cosic could have sought to exercise the authority vested in his office to try to prevent it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [SRM] said it had reversed an earlier decision to boycott the September 24 presidential and local elections, and nominated Belgrade's opposition mayor, Vojislav Mihailovic, to run for president.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a move threatens to hand victory to Milosevic by further splintering the opposition, the rest of which has said it will nominate its own presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement released after yesterday's meeting of its main board, the SRM demanded that the other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parties support Mihailovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope that those parties will not boycott our presidential candidate, a candidate of the largest opposition party, or nominate someone else just to prevent his victory,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest of the Serbian opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> however, is expected to support Vojislav Kostunica, leader of the small, centre-right Democratic Party of Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiations on the issue between all opposition parties, scheduled for today, were later called off after Zoran Djinjic, who heads the second-largest opposition party, expressed doubts that any agreement could be reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had plenty of time for negotiations,&quot; Djinjic, head of the Democratic Party, said. &quot;Our problem is that we were not able to unify goals with SRM.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other opposition leaders have said the talks should be held as planned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHEN the tired young police officers discarded their riot shields and tear-gas cannons to join the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators the whole world cheered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After 13 years of dictatorship the very foundations of Slobodan Milosevic's power was swept aside in the course of a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began shortly after sunrise on Thursday morning when the military roadblocks were knocked over to allow the convoys of jubilant protesters from central Serbia to converge on the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every available road into Belgrade was choked with vehicles. People lined the streets with signs and flags to welcome the revolution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The atmosphere was likened to the world's longest wedding convoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbs of all ages -- the young, the old, the peasants, the academics all carried stickers with the message &quot;A better Serbia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At midday giant speakers were being erected in Republika Square and young street sellers were marketing badges with the clenched fist symbol of the student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the excitement and sense of anticipation spread throughout the city, the crowd swelled to more than 200,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By early afternoon they were peacefully entertaining themselves with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c9">Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> songs in a celebration of the impending revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, it was the pudgy Milosevic who first used mass rallies to propel himself to power in the mid-1980s when he was just another colourless Communist Party official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Displaying the same political skill which has kept him one step ahead of his rivals and his enemies in the West, Milosevic inspired public demonstrations of support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Backed by his wife, Mira Milosevic, he seduced his countrymen by repeatedly playing to their sense of nationalism and over-riding hatred of Croats and Moslems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He unleashed in his people hatreds that would cost them hundreds of thousands of lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mira was Slobodan's childhood sweetheart from their home town of Pozarevac, south-east of Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are described as the classic example of the &quot;banality of evil&quot;; a term first used to describe Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He was a small-town, ambitious, clever but essentially uninteresting Communist wannabe,&quot; said one who knew Mira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Without her he may have risen no higher than being head of a local post office Communist cell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today the treacherous couple have just about run out of options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The running joke in Yugoslavia is that Mira would prefer to be shot than see out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">her days in a rogue state where she may be denied her penchant for carefully coiffed wigs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, it is believed the pair would ideally prefer to retreat to Russia to live out the remainder of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the newly elected Kremlin president is not expected to ignore Western leaders who will react strongly against any country which offers to protect the indicted war criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This leaves only China, Iraq, Libya and North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The American military is reportedly monitoring Yugoslav airspace for any unusual air traffic like a Falcon or DC-10 which have often been used by Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nato aircraft are believed to be under instructions to force any aircraft carrying the disgraced dictator to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, after a lifetime surrounded by the tight-knit Serbian community, many observers predict life in a foreign land could be too much to bear for Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both his parents committed suicide and with the people of Serbia baying for blood this may ultimately be considered the couple's best option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Thursday's demonstrations began peacefully by 2pm the crowd was restless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surrounded by thousands of police in riot gear the demonstrators began throwing rocks at the parliament and several hundred stormed into the rear of the 84-year-old building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police responded by firing tear gas into the crowd which retaliated by setting fire to the police cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the violence was limited and short lived. The demonstrators sensed the reluctance and nervousness of the police to follow orders and put down the uprising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A busload of special police in blue uniforms inched its way through the crowds, the police at times acknowledging the uprising with victory salutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the loud speaker the voice of an opposition spokesman could be heard above the noise of the crowd declaring victory over the parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have the parliament building. It is ours. Long Live Serbia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the frenzy, the offices of Mrs Milosevic were ransacked and, as a political trophy, an expensive brown leather chair was carried out of the building and dumped into a bin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Immediately afterwards, against a backdrop of thick acrid smoke, a lone protester climbed silently onto the plush upholstery and ceremoniously urinated over it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At 4pm gunshots rang out through the centre of the city and ambulances were heard winding their way through the frenzied streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By this stage the world's leaders, who until now had been glued to the dramatic live coverage on television, were beginning to stir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Washington, President Bill Clinton declared the US stand &quot;with those trying to get their country back&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> British Prime Minister Tony Blair stepped out into the autumn sunshine in London and demanded Milosevic leave office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Your time is up. Go now. Don't wait until there has been more death and destruction,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crowd in Belgrade then turned its anger on the state-run Radio Television Serbia which had virtually ignored opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica during the lead-up to the September 24 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By nightfall it was in flames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is the last time that Serbia and Yugoslavia will bleed for its freedom,&quot; said one protester. &quot;Milosevic's main crime is that he did not listen to his people, and hid in his bunker. He ran politics as though he was the only person in Yugoslavia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The extraordinary eruption of people power was the culmination of eight days of procrastination by Milosevic who refused to accept the outcome of the presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government dominated federal election commission admitted that Milosevic's rival had won 48% of the vote to his 38% but it called for another poll because his challenger had fallen short of 50%.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia--Pro-democracy forces claimed sweeping victory Saturday in Serbia's parliamentary elections, declaring that they now have a mandate to remove the last vestiges of Slobodan Milosevic's regime in Yugoslavia's main republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Opposition of Serbia, led by Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica, announced it had won about 64 percent of the vote, compared to about 13 percent for Milosevic's Socialists. The ultranationalist Radical Party trailed with about 8 percent in the elections in Serbia, the larger of two republics that make up Yugoslavia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DOS claim was based on a count of about 40 percent of the votes. The Socialists confirmed the results, drawing some comfort from the fact that they will be the largest single party in the parliament because DOS is an 18-party coalition that many political observers expect to break up in the coming year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who did everything to make the Socialists disappear from the political scene were not right,&quot; Socialist Party general-secretary Zoran Andjelkovic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest loser was the neo-communist Yugoslav Left Party of Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, which won less than 1 percent of the vote, the initial results showed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exit polls and unofficial returns also showed that the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> led by Vuk Draskovic--for years the undisputed leader of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">--won only 4 percent of the vote, not enough to make it into parliament. Draskovic's party had refused to join the Kostunica coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the election results hold, Serbia will have its first non-Socialist government in half a century, since World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Center for Free Elections and Democracy, a leading non-governmental monitoring group that conducted exit polls, predicted that in the 250-member parliament, Kostunica's coalition would take 176 seats, the Socialists 36, the Radicals 23 and--in the biggest surprise--15 seats would go to the Serbian Unity Party of indicted war crimes suspect Zeljko Raznatovic, who was assassinated in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official returns were not expected until today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election afforded Kostunica the opportunity to complete the revolution set in motion when he defeated Milosevic for the federal presidency Sept. 24. Milosevic refused to accept the result and called for a runoff, triggering riots Oct. 5 that forced him to concede defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's allies continued to control the government of Serbia, which accounts for more than 90 percent of Yugoslavia's population of 10 million. The Serbian government also controls the key levers of power such as the judiciary and the 60,000-strong Serbian police.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Belgrade - Undaunted by police beatings, opponents of the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, took to the streets in protest again yesterday, following clashes on Christmas Eve between pro- and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> crowds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Five were hospitalised, including one man who remained in a critical condition after being shot in the head during the disturbances by a supporter of Mr Milosevic's ruling Socialist party (SPS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than a month of street protests against Mr Milosevic had gone without violence until Tuesday, when the SPS arranged to bus supporters into Belgrade for a rally at the same time and place as the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vuk Draskovic, leader of the opposition Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Tuesday's events let the genie of violence out of the bottle and marked &quot;the beginning of civil war in Belgrade&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The harder Mr Milosevic tries to shore up the credibility of his SPS as a party ruling Serbia by popular consent, the more events conspire to prove him wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another figleaf was peeled away when Mr Milosevic's party rallied only 40,000 supporters in Belgrade under police protection on Tuesday, after boasting it would mobilise half a million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Snow, bitter temperatures, icy streets and the memory of Tuesday's running battles yesterday did little to dampen the students' enthusiasm, although their numbers were down substantially from the 200,000 who demonstrated on the previous day. In Serbia, Christmas is celebrated on 6 January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blowing whistles and horns and chanting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> slogans, protesters snaked through the centre of the city, drawing waves and cheers of support from many onlookers in office and residential blocks along the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington and Paris warned that they held Mr Milosevic responsible for Belgrade's street violence. The German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, said any more violence would damage Serbia's efforts to reintegrate with Europe. Western governments spent much of the last year praising Mr Milosevic as a responsible world leader for his work in support of the Bosnian peace agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still firmly in control of all institutions of government, including state television, the army and police, Mr Milosevic shows no sign of surrendering power voluntarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diplomats say Russia would probably block any effort by the UN Security Council to pressure Mr Milosevic by reimposing economic sanctions on Serbia, which were lifted earlier this year in the wake of the Bosnia peace deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His ability to use force now has been virtually vetoed by US-led Western threats of reprisals and also by hints of reluctance on the part of the security forces to get too involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monitors listening to police radios during the clashes on Tuesday heard commanders ordering their men to use minimum force, even when they or SPS supporters were taking a beating from opposition activists of the Zajedno (Together) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like everyone else who works for the Serbian state, the police are paid only when the government can find the cash and therefore have less interest in preserving it. The army, which used tanks to save Mr Milosevic and quell anti-government protests that cost two lives in 1991, has stayed silently on the sidelines in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The idea that the SPS might ditch Mr Milosevic rests on the theory that the thousands of party members who hold every worthwhile job in the state apparatus and the economy have too much to lose to relinquish power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their wealth has been milked from the labour and looted from the bank accounts of ordinary Serbs, as Zajedno never tires of telling its supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Out of power, they would be held accountable for the destruction of former Yugoslavia and the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, which have reduced Serbia's people to economic ruin.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Helen McCabe reports on Yugoslavia's revolution against 'the Butcher of the Balkans'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is the last time that Serbia and Yugoslavia will bleed for its freedom'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN the tired young Serbian police officers discarded their riot shields and tear gas cannons to join the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, the whole world cheered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 13 years of dictatorship, the very foundations of Slobodan Milosevic's power was swept aside in the course of a single day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began just after sunrise on Thursday morning when the military roadblocks were knocked over to allow the convoys of jubilant protesters from central Serbia to converge on the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every available road into Belgrade was choked with vehicles. People lined the streets with signs and flags to welcome the revolution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The atmosphere was likened to the world's longest wedding convoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbs of all ages -- the young, the old, the peasants, the academics -- all carried stickers with the message, &quot;A better Serbia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At noon the giant speakers were being erected in Republika Square and young street sellers were marketing badges with the clenched fist symbol of the student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the excitement and sense of anticipation spread throughout the city, the crowd swelled to more than 200,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By early afternoon they were peacefully entertaining themselves with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> songs in a celebration of the impending revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, it was the pudgy Slobodan Milosevic who first used mass rallies to propel himself to power in the mid-1980s when he was just another colourless Communist Party official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Displaying the same political skill which has kept him one step ahead of his rivals and his enemies in the West, Milosevic inspired public demonstrations of support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backed by his adored wife, Mira, he seduced his countrymen by repeatedly playing to their sense of nationalism and over-riding hatred of Croats and Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He unleashed in his people hatred that would cost hundreds of thousands of them their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mira was Slobodan's childhood sweetheart from their home town of Pozarevac, south-east of Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are described as the classic examples of the &quot;banality of evil&quot;; a term first used to describe Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a small-town, ambitious, clever but essentially uninteresting Communist wannabe,&quot; said one who knew Mira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without her he may have risen no higher than being head of a local post office Communist cell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the treacherous couple have just about run out of options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The running joke in Yugoslavia is that Mira would prefer to be shot than see out her days in a rogue state where she may be denied her penchant for carefully coiffed wigs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, it is believed the pair would ideally prefer to retreat to Russia to live out the remainder of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the newly elected Kremlin president is not expected to ignore Western leaders who will react strongly against any country which offers to protect the indicted war criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This leaves only China, Iraq, Libya and North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American military are reportedly monitoring Yugoslav airspace for any unusual air traffic like a Falcon or DC-10 which often have been used by Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nato aircraft are believed to be under instructions to force any aircraft carrying the disgraced dictator to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, after a lifetime surrounded by the tight-knit Serbian community, many observers have predicted life in a foreign land could be too much to bear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both his parents committed suicide and, with the people of Serbia baying for blood, this may ultimately be considered their best option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Thursday's demonstrations began peacefully, by 2pm the crowd was restless. Surrounded by thousands of police in riot gear, the demonstrators began throwing rocks at the parliament and several hundred stormed the rear of the 84-year-old building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police responded by firing tear gas into the crowd, who retaliated by setting fire to cars. But the violence was limited and short-lived. The demonstrators sensed the reluctance and nervousness of the police to follow orders and put down the uprising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A busload of special police in blue uniforms inched their way through the crowds, at times acknowledging the uprising with victory salutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THROUGH a loudspeaker the voice of an opposition spokesman could be heard, above the noise of the crowd, declaring victory over the parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have the parliament building. It is ours, long live Serbia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the frenzy, the offices of Mrs Milosevic were ransacked and, as a political trophy, an expensive brown leather chair was carried out of the building and dumped into a bin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately afterwards, against a backdrop of thick acrid smoke, a lone protester climbed silently on to the plush upholstery and ceremoniously urinated over it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 4pm, gunshots rang out through the centre of the city and a fleet of ambulances were heard winding their way through the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By this stage the world's leaders, who until then had been glued to the dramatic live coverage on television, were beginning to stir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, President Bill Clinton declared the US stood &quot;with those trying to get their country back&quot;. British Prime Minister Tony Blair stepped out into the autumn sun in London and demanded Milosevic leave office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your time is up. Go now. Don't wait until there has been more death and destruction,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd then turned its anger on the state-run Radio Television Serbia which had virtually ignored opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica during the lead-up to the September 24 election -- by nightfall it was in flames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the last time that Serbia and Yugoslavia will bleed for its freedom,&quot; said one protester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His main crime is that he did not listen to his people, and hid in his bunker. He ran politics as though he was the only person in Yugoslavia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extraordinary eruption of people power was the culmination of eight days of procrastination by Milosevic who refused to accept the outcome of the presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government-dominated Federal Election Commission admitted that his rival had won 48 percent of the vote to his 38 percent but it called for another poll because his challenger had fallen short of 50 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public anger was fuelled by the suspicion of vote rigging, which observers estimated meant the real support for Kostunica was more like 52 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final straw was a decision by the constitutional court to declare the entire poll invalid, therefore raising the spectre of new elections at a time of Milosevic's choosing. Of course, he would have remained in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the court has to do now is determine that there have been no elections at all and the opposition invented them,&quot; said one opposition worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poster reflected the universal anger at the court's decision: &quot;It's no use: one plus one still make two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this time the anger was being channelled into a historic insurrection which was carried across Serbia in a wave of confidence and goodwill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president who put his country through three wars -- Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo -- today finds himself deserted not only by the rest of the world but also by his police force, his army, the propaganda unit he set up and, most importantly, by his people.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro-democracy forces claimed a sweeping victory Saturday in Serbia's parliamentary elections, declaring they now have a mandate to remove the last vestiges of Slobodan Milosevic's regime in Yugoslavia's main republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Opposition of Serbia or DOS, led by Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica, announced it had won about 64 per cent of the vote, compared to about 13 per cent for Milosevic's Socialists. The ultranationalist Radical Party trailed with about eight per cent in the elections in Serbia, the larger of two republics that make up Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We declare triumphant victory,&quot; said DOS spokesperson Cedomir Jovanovic as coalition leaders uncorked champagne. &quot;With the two-thirds majority in the parliament we will be able to change the character of this country.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DOS claim was based on a count of about 40 per cent of the votes. The Socialists confirmed the results, drawing some comfort from the fact that they will be the largest single party in the parliament because DOS is an 18-party coalition that many political observers expect to break up in the coming year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who did everything to make the Socialists disappear from the political scene were not right,&quot; Socialist Party general secretary Zoran Andjelkovic said. &quot;I'm sure we'll have 20 per cent of the votes in the end and we'll be the strongest opposition party in the parliament.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest loser was the neo-communist Yugoslav Left Party of Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, which won less than one per cent of the vote, the initial, unofficial results showed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exit polls and unofficial returns also showed that the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> led by Vuk Draskovic -- for years the undisputed leader of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- won only four per cent of the vote, not enough to make it into parliament. Draskovic's party had refused to join the Kostunica coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Centre for Free Elections and Democracy, a leading non-governmental monitoring group that conducted exit polls, predicted that in the 250-member parliament, Kostunica's coalition would take 177 seats, the Socialists 35, the Radicals 23 and -- in the biggest surprise -- 15 seats would go to the Serbian Unity Party of indicted war crimes suspect Zeljko Raznatovic, also known as Arkan, who was assassinated in Belgrade in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official returns were not expected until Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's pretty clear we have won,&quot; said Zoran Djindjic, a Kostunica ally slated to become Serbia's first non-Communist prime minister since the Second World War. &quot;We will win the elections, but a huge job comes afterward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apparent victory affords Kostunica the opportunity to complete the revolution set in motion when he defeated Milosevic for the federal presidency Sept. 24. Milosevic refused to accept the result and called for a runoff, triggering riots Oct. 5 that forced him to concede defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's allies continued to control the government of Serbia, which accounts for more than 90 per cent of Yugoslavia's population of 10 million. The Serbian government also controls the key levers of power such as the judiciary and the 60,000-strong Serbian police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic reconstruction of Serbia and Yugoslavia will be completed after these elections,&quot; Kostunica said as he cast his ballot. &quot;We are continuing what we began in September. I am convinced that the results will enable us to carry on with the work ... to rebuild the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without a strong party to back him, Milosevic, who has been indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal, is now vulnerable to prosecution in Serbia for 13 years of rule that impoverished Yugoslavia and turned it into a pariah state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The elections show that people want a decisive showdown with the former regime,&quot; said pro-democracy leader Zarko Korac. &quot;The Democratic Opposition of Serbia needs courage to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gradimir Nalic, a candidate for Serbia's new police minister, said, &quot;There will be arrests, but only according to the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial reports indicated voter turnout was about 60 per cent, about 10 per cent less than in September's Yugoslav elections, according to poll watchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marko Blagojevic, an official with the Centre for Free Elections and Democracy, said observers noticed no major irregularities. Monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe also said the vote went smoothly. During Milosevic's era, irregularities were common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rare controversy at the polls was caused by invisible spray that was applied to the fingers of voters to prevent multiple voting. Many elderly voters refused to cast their ballots after rumours that the spray was radioactive and caused impotence, the centre said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An hour after polls opened, Milosevic cast his ballot with his wife in the upscale Dedinje district in Belgrade, where he lives in a villa under heavy security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Escorted by several bodyguards, the gloomy-looking Milosevic declined to comment, saying only, &quot;I wish all a Happy New Year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethnic Albanians in both Kosovo and in areas of southern Serbia bordering the province boycotted the vote. A great majority of them want independence, and consider the elections invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kosovo's capital, Pristina, hundreds of ethnic Albanians demonstrated Saturday in front of UN headquarters to protest a decision by international officials to allow Kosovo Serbs to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kosovo was the only region in Serbia where the Socialist Party defeated pro-democrats. Kosovo Serbs traditionally have been supporters of Milosevic.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, March 18, 1991</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yugoslavia's central government began fighting back today against an attempt by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to disenfranchise the Yugoslav collective presidency, which commands the army and mediates disputes among this hybrid country's six constituent republics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking for the eight-member presidency, the republic of Macedonia's representative on the body, Vasily Tupurkovski, called Milosevic's action an &quot;extremely serious&quot; disruption of the decision-making power of the Yugoslav government and insisted that the Serbian leader's combative tactics would fail. &quot;Nobody can legally block the work of the presidency,&quot; Tupurkovski said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Milosevic declared that his Marxist government no longer recognizes the authority of the presidency and ordered the members from Serbia and three Serbian-dominated jurisdictions to quit, provoking a constitutional crisis. The only one of the four who refused to obey -- the representative from the Serbian province of Kosovo -- was fired today by the Serbian legislature, but Tupurkovski rejected that action, saying that only Kosovo's assembly had such authority.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To pull Yugoslavia back from the brink of disintegration, Tupurkovski called for an urgent meeting of central government leaders and the heads of the six republics on Thursday. Serbian officials said they did not know if Milosevic or any representative of Serbia, the largest and most populous of the republics, would attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even while defending the authority of the presidency, Tupurkovski acknowledged that it had no contact with leaders of the Yugoslav army in the previous 48 hours, and there is widespread concern here that the Serb-dominated military might support Milosevic in a countrywide martial-law crackdown. Milosevic's public dispute with the presidency erupted after he had failed repeatedly to induce the body to order the army to take &quot;emergency measures&quot; against anti-communist street protests in Serbia and separatist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in other Yugoslav republics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbian leader's renegade action comes at a time when this patchwork country is splitting at the seams with ethnic tension. The northwestern republics of Croatia and Slovenia are threatening secession unless central-government control is fundamentally loosened, a prospect that Serbia had long opposed. The two republics, both led by strongly nationalistic, democratic governments, have stopped paying federal taxes and have mobilized large local militias as a defense against possible intervention by the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the Yugoslav airline, JAT, announced that it has suspended all flights between Belgrade -- the capital of both Yugoslavia and Serbia -- and Zagreb, capital of Croatia. There also were reports of two large explosions in the Croatian town of Knin, where a well-armed Serbian minority, under the apparent control of Milosevic, has been skirmishing for months with Croatian police. Serbs in Knin announced an hour after Milosevic's attack on the presidency Saturday that they were &quot;seceding&quot; from Croatia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic, 49, an authoritarian politician who blends militant Serbian nationalism with rigid communism, appears to have been backed into a corner by street protests and chaos in Serbia's state-controlled economy and seems to be trying to shore up his regime with appeals to ethnic sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yugoslav army is led by Serbian generals, some of whom are passionate supporters of Milosevic, and ethnic violence could provoke a military crackdown and thus force an end to the Serbian protests. Such conflict, particularly between Serbs and Croats, also would trigger an explosion of Serbian nationalism, which could prop up Milosevic's popular support as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in Belgrade, as the labyrinthine conflicts within the federal government ground on, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> among students and intellectuals appeared to be gaining ground. Disaffected journalists from Politika, the largest Serbian daily and one that Milosevic controls, held an emotional rally to demand truth in Serbian journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want our newspapers to stop spreading hatred in Serbia, to stop provoking confrontation across Yugoslavia,&quot; said Vladimir Stefanovic, a Politika reporter. &quot;We have stooped to the lowest level in our history. We now want the managing director and chief editors to step down immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another newspaper, Borba, published an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> statement from a political group formed last year by Yugoslavia's prime minister, Ante Markovic. Journalists here described it as the most damning summation of Milosevic's impact on Serbia ever published.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The personal regime of Slobodan Milosevic has entered into the final stage of its agony,&quot; the statement said. &quot;Milosevic has attempted to blame Yugoslavia for all the failures and defects of his policies . . . [and is now trying] to annul the effect of the democratic breakthrough made during street demonstrations at which his policies were spontaneously rejected by the Serbian people. His policies contain all the paradoxes of his personality -- verbal commitment to Yugoslavia, while in fact he is trying to destroy it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YUGOSLAVIA'S top general branded opponents of President Slobodan Milosevic as traitors yesterday, amid growing in-fighting among opposition leaders seeking to oust the Yugoslav leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Those who call for a forceful ouster of the legally elected authorities ... cannot count on the people's support,&quot; General Dragoljub Ojdanic, the army chief of staff, said in remarks published by the pro-government daily Politika.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement was his first since opposition leaders began organising </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti -Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies nearly three weeks ago, trying to capitalise on mounting discontent spurred by the country's defeat by NATO and the loss of Kosovo to NATO troops and its majority ethnic Albanians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is the task of us all now to preserve the stability of the country because there are many sold souls, Western vassals, who want to take power by force and take the country into a new catastrophe,&quot; Gen Ojdanic said. &quot;But they won't have any support from our people.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The general is one of five top officials, including President Milosevic, indicted on war crimes charges by an international tribunal for alleged atrocities against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daily protests against Milosevic and his government have spread over much of Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One prominent opposition politician, Vuk Draskovic, has stayed out of the mainstream </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and on Saturday launched his own push to unseat President Milosevic. Mr Draskovic, head of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke to 15,000 supporters in the central Serbian town of Kragujevac, demanding Mr Milosevic's resignation but at the same time distancing himself from other opposition leaders, accusing them of risking civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic's speech was carefully calculated to unite Yugoslavs who want to topple Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To appease Montenegro, he did not mention the Serbian monarchy; to attract disaffected members of Milosevic's Socialist Party, he stressed a revenge-free transition of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Some people say that the time is coming when Milosevic and all the leaders of his regime must go to jail, that their children will spend day and night visiting their parents in jail. The Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says no to that. We cannot rebuild this country on hate and revenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Those types of statements come from people who have never felt the boot of this regime on their backs, nor have they seen their jails and basements. I was a target of that. Tens of thousands of our members have lost their jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic called on President Milosevic to resign. But adding &quot;we should want more than that&quot;, he called for the establishment of a transition government leading to elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He stressed the importance of avoiding a civil war, &quot;the greatest evil which exists&quot;, and said political change must come peacefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Immediately after the rally, one man was beaten unconscious as fighting broke out between youths of opposing political parties. Youths from the Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the fight broke out after a group of communists threw rocks and bottles at them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Street scuffles are becoming common at political events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this week, a group of opposition activists collecting signatures on a petition calling on Milosevic to resign were beaten by a gang of unidentified men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which represents a moderate nationalist wing of the Serbian opposition, draws inspiration from pre-communist iconography. Some of its leaders wear beards and moustaches in the fashion of pre-Second World War Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some in the crowd wore Serbian peasant hats, a nationalist symbol, and chanted &quot;We want a king,&quot; referring to crown prince Tomislav Karadjordjevic, who lives in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chose for its first rally the anniversary of the death of the Second World War Serbian nationalist hero, Draza Mihailovic, who was killed by communists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The more progressive wing of the opposition led by the Alliance for Change, a coalition of small parties, held a rally in Kragujevac on Thursday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally, however, was much larger and better staged, with busloads of its supporters being brought in from neighbouring villages and towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was basically a slap in the face to the alliance,&quot; said a Serbian journalist who attended both rallies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CACAK, Serbia, Oct. 8</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Townspeople here cheered their mayor today in the street and paraded a yellow bulldozer around the main square for the television cameras in celebration of their part in the revolt in Belgrade that secured their election victory and forced Slobodan Milosevic from power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People from Cacak, one of the most determinedly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> places in Serbia, were at the core of the tide of people who gathered in the capital, Belgrade, on Thursday and overran the federal Parliament and state television station.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Velimir Ilic, the town's popular mayor and a well-known figure in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that opposed Mr. Milosevic, said two officers who were members of an elite police unit in Belgrade and two more in Cacak had helped to coordinate a mass defection of the police as the crowd, spearheaded by off-duty army paratroopers, rushed the Parliament building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a personal contribution from Cacak,&quot; said Mr. Ilic, 49, a broad-shouldered, energetic man who led 10,000 people from his town 60 miles north to Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was coughing badly -- he said he was still suffering from the canister of asphyxiating gas that a policeman shoved down the back of his track suit that day -- and said he had bruises on his arms and back from police batons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the table in his modest offices today, there was a huge basket of lilies from a local flower shop. The card read: &quot;Thank you for everything you have done for us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ilic, long a leading member of the opposition Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> until he fell out with its leader, Vuk Draskovic, said he had always urged concrete action in opposing the Milosevic government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said Mr. Draskovic and other opposition leaders had dismissed his &quot;revolutionary ideas.&quot; But this time, he said, he headed for Belgrade determined to push for a confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was fed up with these long meetings,&quot; he said, &quot;where there's just talking and nothing happens and Milosevic stays in power. I wanted to do something. At a rally here the day before, I told the crowd, 'It's victory or death.' We were fed up living in a Milosevic state. We were sick of watching state Radio Television Serbia, and we swore we would march to RTS even if we got killed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He rallied a 12-mile-long column of cars and trucks and set off from Cacak at 7:30 in the morning for Belgrade. Among the workers, students and truck drivers, he had organized a core team of tough young men and, crucially, off-duty members of the police and the army, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They took bulldozers and trucks to help break through police blockades and in case they needed to build their own barricades. For weapons they took three truckloads of stones, said Dragan Kovacevic, the regional chief of Mr. Ilic's New Serbia Party, who accompanied him at the head of the column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ilic said: &quot;We established a team of young professionals, paratroopers from the Yugoslav Army and young policemen, and we coordinated this with the most elite units of the Interior Ministry Police in Belgrade. We got martial arts experts and professional boxers to join us. We even had plainclothes police coordinating with nearby towns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The off-duty policemen used their walkie-talkies to give the demonstrators crucial warnings of police efforts to block the procession to Belgrade, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That in itself caused problems, as some demonstrators accused them of being police informers. &quot;I had to address the people several times and tell them, 'The police are with us,' &quot; Mr. Ilic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the march to Belgrade they tried to persuade the police to let them through and even join them. Once they were in central Belgrade, the paratroopers and tough young men -- along with members of Otpor, a student resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and even former paramilitaries in the crowd -- spearheaded the lunge for the Parliament building, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That provoked a battle with the police, who fired tear gas and even opened fire on some demonstrators. That confrontation provided the stimulus and the huge crowd took on a life of its own, burning cars, Parliament and the television building, which had not been part of his plan, Mr. Ilic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said his personal agreement with two special policemen from Belgrade, and two from Cacak, had caused major elements of the police in the capital to join the side of the demonstrators. As several hundred thousand people converged in front of Parliament at 3 p.m. and started to clash with the police, his contacts refused orders to move against the demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a certain moment they refused the orders of their superiors and were trying to persuade their colleagues too,&quot; Mr. Ilic said. He said a few influential men in the units had been on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> side before the demonstration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They told us: 'Just keep on going. Sustain the pressure until 3:30 p.m., and then we'll get the order to charge and we'll refuse,' &quot; he said, jumping half off his chair with excitement as he recounted the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Mr. Ilic said, he was scared all along that his agreement with the police was some kind of trap. He had developed contacts with those men during the last few months, but as the election campaign proceeded, he came under heavy police surveillance, including searches of visitors and of his bodyguards' homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already last year, during the NATO bombing campaign, he had to go into hiding after protesting that the army had brought antiaircraft weaponry into the center of Cacak. He was accused by the government of being a traitor and undermining the country's &quot;combat readiness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He took to the hills in southwestern Serbia and hid for 43 days in the woods, and even once in a haystack. When he returned home at the end of the war, he was greeted as a hero by a crowd of some 20,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the last month, he said, he has not slept in his house for fear of arrest. Then one of the special police in Belgrade invited him to stay with him for safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought it was a set-up,&quot; he said, but he accepted. It proved to be an important test of trust. Another test was a warning his police contacts supplied of orders they had to move into the Kolubara coal mines against striking miners on Wednesday. They urged Mr. Ilic to gather a large number of demonstrators to rush to the support of the miners and push through the police barricades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ilic said he had not told other leaders of the democratic opposition of his contacts with the police and paratroopers or of his plans for the big rally in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But once the Milosevic opponents were inside Parliament, he introduced the Democratic Party leader, Zoran Djindjic, and the former army chief of staff, Momcilo Perisic, to the paratroopers. &quot;I told them these men did it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he warned that Mr. Milosevic remained a threat and his party could still fight back. &quot;It is not finished,&quot; he said. &quot;Milosevic is very dangerous. They are buying time and working intensively, and if they feel the moment is right, they could go on the attack.&quot;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ONLY A FEW months ago, Belgrade residents rushed to central Milosa Velikog Street to view the damage to government buildings caused by Nato air raids, aimed at ending the Serbian crackdown in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In front of the same charred buildings on Wednesday night, thousands of city demonstrators ran into cordons of hundreds of police, who brutally halted an opposition march heading towards the villa of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police, in full riot gear, beat up 20 protesters, scattering the demonstration, and arrested 13 opposition activists during the night.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the first police intervention in nine days of peaceful marches organised by the opposition grouping, the Alliance for Change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milan St Protic, a leader of the alliance, suggested to reporters yesterday that the police aggression showed that &quot;Milosevic is nervous&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senior members of the alliance vowed to continue staging regular peaceful protests and to avoid violence at all costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The marches, by tens of thousands of protesters, have been small compared with the mass </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations of 1996 and 1997. In the earlier unrest, the police - considered to be the President's &quot;Praetorian guard&quot; - waited for weeks before using force against protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It remains a mystery why the police went to such lengths to stop the marchers this week when they were more than a mile away from Mr Milosevic's official residence at Dedinje. It is common knowledge here that he has not lived there since it was wrecked by Nato missiles in April. Many doubt that he lives in Belgrade at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vuk Draskovic's Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the biggest opposition party, which has stayed away from the protests so far, strongly condemned the police violence yesterday, saying the use of force showed that the regime was &quot;virtually demanding a bloodbath in Serbia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For months now, a public debate has been continuing over whether the crisis in Serbia will descend into civil war, or even end in the violent overthrow of Mr Milosevic, similar to the downfall of Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania a decade ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One side believes that Mr Milosevic will not hesitate to use force to quell the protests and stay in power - causing inevitable bloodshed. Others disagree, saying that growing poverty, combined with deep animosity towards the Yugoslavian leader and his powerful wife, Mira Markovic, could lead to events similar to those in Romania in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is agreement on one point - that Mr Milosevic is not ready to go willingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbian official media described Wednesday's violence as an attack by &quot;a group of hooligans; sympathisers of the alliance for Nato&quot; against the police, who were carrying out their &quot;regular duties&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Interior Ministry issued a statement saying that &quot;among the perpetrators were known criminals, drug addicts and hooligans who make trouble at sports events&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the leaders of about 18 opposition parties, including the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the rival Alliance for Change, held their first round -table talks aimed at agreeing conditions for any future elections in Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a long process, but it can, step by step, lead to the final result - a joint stand by the opposition in Serbia,&quot; said Vuk Obradovic of the Alliance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vojislav Kostunica, whose shoe-leather campaign and reputation for honesty made him the choice of a nation fed up with Slobodan Milosevic, was sworn in today as the new president of a deeply divided Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kostunica, a 56-year-old constitutional lawyer, won presidential elections on Sept. 24, but he was propelled into office by a popular revolt sparked by Mr. Milosevic's manipulation of the results. Hundreds of thousands of protesters overwhelmed Serbia this week, forcing an end to Mr. Milosevic's 13-year rule, which brought his shrinking country war, isolation and poverty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Looking pale and weary, Mr. Kostunica took the oath of office today before the newly elected federal Parliament, swearing to uphold Yugoslavia's &quot;integrity, sovereignty and independence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a wandering acceptance speech, Mr. Kostunica praised the workings of Serbia's new democracy, where finally political differences might be worked out peacefully. &quot;Today political parties are replacing one another in power,&quot; he said. &quot;Everything is peaceful, and Yugoslavia and Serbia have joined the community of democratic nations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he got a swift foretaste today of the difficulties that he confronts. The scene at the 1970's-era conference center -- chosen as an alternative to the federal Parliament, which was burned in the revolt on Thursday -- was chaotic. Legislators, many of them accompanied by burly bodyguards, negotiated furiously about a future federal government, one result of a half-finished revolution that was bogging down in legal wrangling and political bargaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Mr. Kostunica's problems will be to guide a loose coalition of 18 disparate opposition parties that have never run anything larger than a city. But he must also work to maintain the very Yugoslav Federation over which he presides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He must deal with the problem of restive Montenegro, which has moved a long way toward independence, and of internationally run Kosovo, whose largely Albanian population wants only to be free of any connection with Belgrade, no matter what foreign powers might think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kostunica's inauguration was delayed when his supporters, citing fraud in the presidential vote, disputed the number of parliamentary seats they were awarded, while members of Mr. Milosevic's coalition members fought to keep their Montenegrin allies on board and thus preserve their majority. The Montenegrins appeared to remain with Mr. Milosevic's coalition for now, but gave hints that they might soon switch to Mr. Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new president has floated the idea of a unity government of experts on the federal level that could include members of other parties that had backed Mr. Milosevic, like the Socialist People's Party from Montenegro, and even Mr. Milosevic's party itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In trying to gain a majority for his parliamentary allies, Mr. Kostunica has the complex task of trying to court both pro- and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> factions in Montenegro: the Montenegrin Socialists, and the Montenegrin president, whose boycott of the September elections left his party with no seats in the federal Parliament. Mr. Kostunica also knows that the Constitution, altered in a day by Mr. Milosevic in July, must be changed again to keep Montenegro inside Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There remains great bitterness toward the Milosevic government, with Socialist Party headquarters being trashed in at least 20 cities across Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, at the Parliament, a student who belonged to the Otpor, or Resistance, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and served in the army during the Kosovo war confronted two senior Milosevic men, Ljubisa Ristic and Goran Matic, for denouncing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as terrorist. &quot;I'm a member of Otpor,&quot; said Filip Isajlovic. &quot;I was in Kosovo last year. And I will never, ever forgive you for the words and names you called us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working out new relationships with the rest of Europe and the United States, which have welcomed Mr. Milosevic's downfall with full-throated delight, could be comparatively easy, despite questions over the extradition of Mr. Milosevic and other Serbs to The Hague on charges they committed war crimes in Kosovo and Bosnia. The West is eager to help Serbia with financial and other aid and has promised to begin lifting some sanctions against Yugoslavia -- though not the most damaging ones -- as early as Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the federal legislators gathered here this morning, there were reports by witnesses that Mr. Milosevic's son, Marko Milosevic, had flown on a Yugoslav Airlines flight to Moscow, YU-132, with his wife, Milica, and his son, Marko. His uncle, Borislav Milosevic, is Yugoslavia's ambassador to Moscow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ida Kovacevic, a stewardness on the plane, said in an interview after the flight returned here: &quot;Marko came in as an ordinary passenger. He acted normally, and we acted normally. There was no special treatment.&quot; She confirmed that his wife and son were also aboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgraders noted gleefully today that in his resignation speech on Friday night, Mr. Milosevic said he wanted &quot;to spend more time with my family, especially my grandson, Marko.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He should go join them soon,&quot; said Vesna Mitic, standing today staring at the burned-out Parliament building where legislators can no longer meet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Meri Locani said: &quot;I wouldn't even let him go to Russia. Why did he let all this happen? If people have a chance, they would hang him and his wife here in the square.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she heard Mr. Milosevic's resignation speech, Mrs. Locani said, &quot;I was so happy, as happy as I've ever been.&quot; She wiped at her eyes. She has a paraplegic daughter, Savina, 27, she said, adding: &quot;I'd be the happiest person in the world if she could walk. But in the last few days I was so happy. It was almost as if she were walking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Milosevic remains here, with stated ambitions to continue in politics as the Socialist Party leader, which makes many uneasy. Aleksandar Tijanic, Mr. Milosevic's former spokesman who became a critic of his rule, said today: &quot;As long as Milosevic remains on the Serbian political scene and shows a desire to be politically active, he represents a threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Milosevic &quot;represents the political interests&quot; of all those not in the democratic opposition, Mr. Tijanic said in an interview. But more important, &quot;he's also the supreme commander of the net of paramilitaries, para-police and para-financial interests&quot; that have thrived with and supported him and his wife, Mirjana Markovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Milosevic can pull some strings,&quot; Mr. Tijanic said. &quot;These cannot bring down the new government, but can keep it in constant instability and keep the public of Serbia in a constant state of tension.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Mr. Kostunica's main challenges, Mr. Tijanic said, is to enforce his authority over the opposition coalition and prevent any revolutionary bypassing of the law. &quot;He should break down party interests in the coalition, because he won as the candidate of Serbian political opinion, and not as their candidate,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more powerful Serbian Parliament, which has supported Mr. Milosevic and whose members are not scheduled to face election until next year, is to meet on Monday. Maneuvering there with two parties that have been sometime allies of Mr. Milosevic could alter the face of the Serbian government, but exactly who will now control that legislature remains uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the Serbian Parliament will recognize Mr. Kostunica, and may fire the Serbian Interior Minister, a key Milosevic ally, and abolish a draconian information law.  But Mr. Kostunica and his allies must also begin to control the Serbian ministries that are now beholden to Mr. Milosevic and his coalition. The opposition is moving &quot;minister by minister, institution by institution,&quot; trying to establish cooperation, a party leader said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the Greek and Norwegian foreign ministers flew to Belgrade today for the hastily arranged inauguration ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greek minister, George Papandreou, and his government have tried to be intermediaries between Serbia and the rest of Europe, and between Mr. Kostunica and the Milosevic government. Mr. Papandreou said the end of Mr. Milosevic's rule ushers in &quot;a new era in relations between Yugoslavia and Europe.&quot;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key opponent of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic insisted on early elections yesterday and criticized rivals for seeking civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections are &quot;the only realistic concept that could lead to the fall of this regime,&quot; Vuk Draskovic told a news conference.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic blasted plans by other parties to organize an all-out uprising against Milosevic in the next two months, saying it could only lead to civil war and help Milosevic stay in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The opposition must fight for conditions for democratic elections. We can demonstrate, but only to demand democratic elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His demand for early elections, rather than Milosevic's resignation and the formation of a transitional government has split Serbia's fractious opposition parties. Their failure to unite in the past has ruined other chances to oust Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPPOSITION UNITY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic's main rivals, Zoran Djindjic and his Alliance for Change, have spearheaded </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies throughout Serbia since June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of opposition unity was discussed yesterday in Montenegro between Djindjic, former general Vuk Obradovic and U.S. Balkan envoy James Dobbins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A member of the opposition delegation, Vladan Batic, told Beta news agency the Serbs told Dobbins they would work to overcome divisions within the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic rejected the idea of a Milosevic-organized election, saying the government would rig the vote. Milosevic's Socialist party last week indicated they would push for early elections as soon as November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, a group of Yugoslav army generals reiterated earlier warnings the army will intervene if there is violence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of pupils in Yugoslavia stayed away from school yesterday in the first wave of a nationwide blitz of strikes and protests aimed at forcing president Slobodan Milosevic to accept election defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The school boycotts came in advance of a large demonstration planned for central Belgrade last night to launch a mass protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> similar to those that helped strangle hard-line regimes across Eastern Europe in the past decade.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 2,000 students waved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> banners and paralysed the centre of Nis, Serbia's third largest city. In one Nis high school only the principal was left inside as pupils poured onto the streets chanting: 'Save Serbia and kill yourself, Slobodan.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'I know why you are not in school today. You refuse to accept injustice,' Nis Mayor Zoran Zivkovic told the pupils at a rally. He urged parents to join their youngsters on the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similar walkouts - joined by shopkeepers and others - were staged in several other cities, including the opposition strongholds of Cacak and Kragujevac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Serbia must stop in order to go forward,' an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leader, Zoran Djindjic, told protesters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratic Serbia will protest!&quot; he cried. &quot;In the streets, the schools, the universities, the factories, the theaters. . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic is a leader of an opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> thrust suddenly into the international spotlight as the first serious challenge in years to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. For the last 13 days, the opposition has led huge demonstrations against Milosevic's moves to undo its recent victories at the polls.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's demonstrations were the biggest since Milosevic came to power in 1987. An estimated 150,000 people marched through the capital, aiming eggs and firecrackers at city hall and state TV. The rally began when about 15,000 students took to the streets, and it grew throughout the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the fight for democracy and our future,&quot; said Milica Panic, 23, a law student, as she joined a long column of marching youths. &quot;It is not just a fight for election results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet as products of Serbian politics, the principal leaders of this fledgling opposition have little training in authentic democracy and, in the past, have voiced the same strident nationalism that fueled the bloody disintegration of the former Yugoslavia. Their experience and background raise questions about their ability to sustain the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and to govern should they ever gain power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic Party, who is quickly emerging as the most capable opposition leader, campaigned on behalf of the political party of indicted war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic during September elections in neighboring Bosnia. And Draskovic formed a paramilitary army in 1991 to battle independence-seeking Croats. He and Djindjic have renounced violence, but their statements over the years have been contradictory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The daily protests have been large and impressive. Tens of thousands marched through Belgrade again Friday, chanting &quot;Let's go, all out attack!&quot; and pelting Milosevic's office building with red paint and eggs. The opposition coalition, known as Zajedno (Together), announced that it would launch labor strikes starting tomorrow in an effort to widen the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to include unions and workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the protests have been dominated by students, pensioners and middle-class professionals. For the opposition to have a significant impact on Milosevic's leftist authoritarian regime, it must attract blue-collar support, analysts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few observers here expect the opposition to succeed in toppling Milosevic, who is seen by the West as a guarantor of last year's Bosnia peace accord. He retains control over a loyal, 80,000-member police force and almost all media. But his decision to annul opposition victories in municipal elections Nov. 17, which triggered the protests, has seriously damaged his international credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If opposition parties eventually do gain some local power, diplomats fear a period of instability and municipal chaos. The opposition - largely inexperienced and unskilled in the ways of municipal management - would face a hostile federal government that will make running the cities a nightmare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal government still would control state coffers and such crucial resources as heating oil. Diplomats say one reason Milosevic is so adamant against sharing power is that such an arrangement would give foes a better view of rampant corruption that his cronies engage in through state-favored companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zajedno coalition's mandate would be limited politically as well. The ultranationalist Radical Party and Milosevic's Socialists would continue to control large blocs at the federal and local level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also questionable whether the coalition could remain united.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where Draskovic, 50, is an emotional symbol and a charismatic firebrand, Djindjic, 44, is a handsome, brainy pragmatist. Political and personality clashes have marked their relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born at the end of World War II to partisans who had fought the German occupation, Draskovic was one of the first proponents of a Greater Serbia, the idea of uniting Serbs throughout the Balkans in a single state. Milosevic mastered the concept and used it as motivation for wars in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic came to reject war, however, was branded a traitor by Bosnian Serbs, and was jailed and badly beaten by Milosevic's security forces in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the current protests appear to have given him a renewed focus, he has a reputation for flip-flopping on issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic, whose apparent victory in the Belgrade mayoral race this month was annulled by Milosevic, studied in Germany with Marxist intellectuals in the 1970s, landed in legal trouble back home in Yugoslavia because of his student activism, and then rose to the leadership of the Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Draskovic, Djindjic has had conflicts with Milosevic involving what he regarded as Milosevic's abandonment of Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia. He maintained ties to Karadzic and the Bosnian Serbs throughout the war, and he was a frequent guest in Karadzic's Bosnian headquarters of Pale.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN A massive show of defiance of President Slobodan Milosevic, more than 150,000 people filled a downtown square of the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, on Wednesday night to show their support for the opposition presidential candidate, Vojislav Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final pre-election rally for Mr Kostunica, of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), was notable for his down-to-earth words that struck a chord with many. &quot;I am an ordinary man, like most of you. I don't want to change the world. My intention is to change this country with you,&quot; he told the cheering audience.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We all want to live in an average country, where everything is average. Nothing like the past decade that brought us wars, refugees, isolation, sanctions, criminal Nato bombing. We want a state where the authorities will be afraid of the people, and where people will not be afraid of the regime, poverty and violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their hands clenched into fists, the symbol of the popular student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor (Resistance), thousands responded with &quot;Save Serbia from this madhouse, Kostunica&quot;. Many people wore Otpor shirts or others that said: &quot;We're stronger&quot; or &quot;There's a way out&quot;. Women's groups gave away aprons with the inscription &quot;It's time to clean up Serbia&quot;. Many people carried simple flyers that said &quot;He's (Milosevic is) done&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Kostunica described Yugoslavia as being &quot;a hostage of a single man&quot;. &quot;If I were this man, I'd step down, but Milosevic does not want to do so.&quot; To the crowd that booed whenever Mr Milosevic's name was mentioned, he added: &quot;Our credo is people. Their credo is power. Power at all costs, until the last Serb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Veterans of many </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests could not recall such a civilised and dignified rally for the past decade. Pensioners had brought their grandchildren, young couples came with their babies. The police maintained a low-key presence and traffic was blocked from the streets around the parliament building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Kostunica had his only chance to appear on state controlled Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) on Wednesday. Under the electoral law, he was allocated a one-hour slot. He walked from the few hundred yards from RTS to the rally. Witnesses said the building echoed with the applause of the employees, who cheered Mr Kostunica as he left. &quot;Something like that has never happened before,&quot; an RTS employee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the crowds peacefully dispersed after the rally, Ivana Stajic, 20, a Belgrade student said: &quot;I hope Kostunica wins. For years now, I have known only Milosevic. I don't know what it feels like to start the day without thinking of him and the problems he brought us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, some expressed doubts. &quot;It doesn't matter if Kostunica wins here... Many outside Serbia support Milosevic... he suits many,&quot; one middle- aged man said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opinion surveys show Mr Kostunica holding a significant lead against Mr Milosevic. Fears are mounting that the President would not concede a loss and could try to stay in power by rigging the vote or imposing martial law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- In a massive outpouring of opposition sentiment, masses of Serbs took to the streets of this capital last night to demand the resignation of President Slobodan Milosevic and call for democratic change in Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ignoring the government's last-minute political manoeuvers and veiled warnings of violence aimed at limiting attendance, the crowd clogged a vast area in front of the Yugoslav federal parliament building, waved opposition party flags and chanted slogans against Mr. Milosevic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estimates of the size of the crowd varied wildly, from a low of at ''least 50,000'' to a high of ''more than 150,000.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally, the largest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstration here since a series of protests against alleged election fraud in late 1996 and early 1997, proceeded peacefully despite tense moments shortly after it started when a tear gas grenade exploded in the crowd and briefly scattered protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Red bandits!'' yelled angry demonstrators after the tear gas exploded, a reference to the communist origins of Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party of Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaker after speaker called for the resignation of Mr. Milosevic, who has held power for the past decade, first as president of Serbia and since 1997 as president of the Yugoslav federation. Serbia is the dominant republic in the federation, which also includes Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the speakers was Vuk Draskovic, the mercurial leader of the largest opposition party, who earlier had cancelled his speech at the rally in a dispute over the appearance of a rival politician. His change of heart apparently reflected the size of the gathering. Although the crowd exceeded organizers' expectations, it was unclear where the protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> goes from here. The opposition remains badly divided, and Mr. Milosevic has survived previous attempts to force him out during his 10 years in power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbs go to the polls today to chose a president and a new parliament, but the tension palpable on the streets of the Yugoslav capital in the hours leading up to the vote has revealed the nation's uncertainty about the election and the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yugoslavs appear to be wrestling with the question: ''Are we about to elect a president or descend into violence and war?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm scared a little bit,'' acknowledged Vukasin Petrovic, an activist with the Otpor (Resistance) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''because I can't predict what will happen in the next days. There are so many options (as to what can happen). . . . I must wait, and that kills me.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts and voters say the elections are the most crucial Yugoslavia has faced in more than a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About seven million voters will pass judgment on the tumultuous 13-year regime of President Slobodan Milosevic, a Communist leader who won power in 1987 and rode successfully into the post-communist era on a wave of nationalism and war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public opinion suggests Milosevic will lose the election to Vojislav Kostunica, a previously obscure academic who leads the incumbent in the polls by six to 20 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica, leader of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia alliance, is favoured to win in a fair fight. But the tension galvanizing Yugoslavia -- from the Adriatic coast of Montenegro to the ethnic Hungarian villages in the north Serbian province of Vojvodina -- hinges on the widespread fear Milosevic will attempt to steal the election and defend the theft with the might of the Yugoslav army and the federation's paramilitary police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since opposition supporters are expected to take to the streets en masse if the government rigs the vote, many Serbs fear the election will end in tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There will be blood,'' said Aleks Milutinovic, 33, a Belgrade journalist. ''That's my prediction. The government will steal the election, the opposition will protest and the police will crack down hard.  Milosevic has shown a willingness to unleash his attack dogs at the first sign of protest. This worked in the past, and it will work again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But anything can happen. Here are some possibilities:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Milosevic will win by stealing votes in Montenegro and Kosovo, declare victory and use the armed forces to back him up. The likely result: protests and violence across Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Milosevic will lose, concede defeat but invoke the nation's old constitution and remain in office until next summer. Likely result: protests by the outraged opposition. But if Milosevic is successful, such a stalling technique will buy the Balkan strongman sufficient time to regroup and fortify his position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- None of the four presidential candidates will win an outright majority, forcing a second round in October or November. Result: Milosevic gains time to plan a comeback; but opposition candidates of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Serbian Radical Party could back Kostunica in a second round, burying Milosevic in an opposition landslide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Milosevic will lose the presidential elections, concede defeat but steal local elections and retain power by controlling parliament and the cities. Result: Milosevic could persevere by holding the legislative reins of government. But loss of the presidency would diminish the strongman in the eyes of his constituents and likely mark the beginning of his demise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Montenegro have created fears there will be a post-election conflict in this independence-minded Yugoslav republic. Late last week, a Montenegrin policeman, loyal to the republic's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government, was shot and killed by a pro-Serb Yugoslav government soldier just outside of the capital of Podgorica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar incidents could trigger violence between Montenegro and Serbia -- Yugoslavia's last two republics -- giving Milosevic the pretext to declare martial law, annul the elections and remain in power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A TENSE mood of uncertainty hangs over Yugoslavia as voters prepare to cast their ballots in tomorrow's presidential elections. Although polls show President Slobodan Milosevic trailing opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica by 7-10 percentage points, analysts expect the regime to rely on massive electoral fraud for a victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The talk in Belgrade's cafes last night revolved around what might happen when, tomorrow night, the regime and the Democratic Opposition of Serbia both declare victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Yugoslav army commander, General Nebojsa Pavkovic, has warned that his troops will prevent any violent attempt to take over the government from the streets - the opposition has urged its supporters to take to the streets to celebrate its expected victory.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition supporters are acutely aware that the Milosevic regime cannot afford to concede defeat, and know he will not hesitate to crush protests with a show of force. The country is teetering on the brink of a violent confrontation between Mr Milosevic's supporters and backers of Mr Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Polls show that Mr Milosevic is running a deficit of 800,000 votes to avoid a run-off with Mr Kostunica. The president can, in theory, steal up to 200,000 votes without raising any eyebrows, but anything over that will require massive election fraud, according to election analysts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nobody doubts Mr Milosevic's determination to stay in power, primarily because he has been indicted for war crimes by the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. The only question is how far Mr Milosevic will go to defend his internationally ostracised regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Police will launch a massive attack on opposition supporters to snuff out the potential of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; said Darko, a 27-year-old news editor at a Belgrade TV station. His view is the most widespread. Dozens of protesters were treated for serious injuries last September and in May, when local protests threatened to turn into mass </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If something big happens, it won't be in Belgrade. A violent uprising is most likely to begin in southern cities like Nis or Kraljevo where people are poorer and more disillusioned, and where the regime has never unleashed a large show of force,&quot; said an opposition strategist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others speculate that the election will never happen. &quot;Milosevic will at the last moment create a crisis, either in Kosovo or Montenegro, in order to avoid an election in which he is certain to be humiliated,&quot; said Boyan, 38, a taxi driver who has fought in four nationalist wars for the Milosevic regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local observers say Mr Milosevic miscalculated when he scheduled early elections in July. He was so confident of his popularity that he changed the Yugoslav constitution so that the president would be elected by popular vote instead of by federal parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though he has been in power for 12 years, Mr Milosevic has only faced two elections. In 1990 and 1992, in early elections, he was the candidate for the office of the president of Serbia and won 65 and 53 per cent of the vote, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now he has the support of less than 30 per cent of the voting public. He assumed that a divided opposition would lead him to victory, but Mr Kostunica unexpectedly emerged from the shadows to undermine the political formulas that have kept Mr Milosevic in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regardless of what happens tomorrow, Mr Kostunica has profoundly affected Yugoslavia's political landscape. His soft-spoken manner contrasts sharply with the bombastic style favoured by Serbia's opposition leaders over the past decade. The country has had enough of sound and fury politics and wants a candidate it can trust. Mr Kostunica's campaign slogan promises just that: &quot;Who is the candidate you can look straight in the eye?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the past decade Mr Milosevic has relied on the egoistic squabbles within the opposition to remain in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Kostunica undermined that predictable formula; 19 parties backed him, while one opposition party, led by Vuk Draskovic, fielded its own candidate. Mr Draskovic's party is widely viewed as being in collusion with Mr Milosevic and has plummeted in popularity. The result has been a more clear definition of opposition to the president.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VIOLENT CLASHES between Milosevic loyalists and supporters of the democratic Serb opposition were narrowly averted last night when the ruling Serb Socialist party apparently lost its nerve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party bosses had scheduled a demonstration at the same time and place as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opposition. Many expected violence - on the last occasion of such a deliberate double-booking, one man was killed. Yesterday however, in the face of growing anger, the Socialists backed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They started to erect a stage for their rival meeting yesterday afternoon. But the hostility of the crowd was so strong that they finally gave up and left the pieces lying uselessly on the ground just a few metres from the stage that the opposition successfully erected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the demonstration, a local Socialist Party boss fired gun shots from his office balcony, causing brief panic among the thousands who had gathered in the central square. However, the meeting went off peacefully. Supporters of Slobodan Milosevic unfurled a banner from a balcony demanding &quot;Traitors Leave Toplica&quot; (the region surrounding Prokuplje) but they were booed off the balcony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the usually self-confident Milosevic supporters who seemed frightened. An old man inside the locked Socialist Party Headquarters told The Independent that the demonstration was &quot;absolute barbarism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were scuffles between supporters and opponents of the regime, but there were no injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zoran Djindjic, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, received a much warmer welcome in Prokuplje than he had at the hands of the Kosovo Serbs in Gracanica earlier in the day. He called for a peaceful solution to Serbia's problems, saying: &quot;There are not so many Serbs that we can fight and kill each other&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All over the country, signs of resistance are multiplying - though the protests have not yet reached critical mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Resistance to the regime is taking different forms. In the industrial town of Nis down the road from Prokuplje, people lined up at trestle tables to sign demands for Mr Milosevic's resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaign is organised under the slogan, &quot;Many Reasons - But One Demand: Resignation&quot;. Each signatory gives not just their name but address and ID number. These serve not just to show that the signatories are real, but also that people are not afraid. Most of the planned signing points in Nis were dismantled after the police threatened arrests. But outside a shopping mall in the city centre, organisers stayed put, daring the police to do their worst. In other towns, the gathering of signatures was banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vuk Draskovic's Serb Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO) - formerly a pillar of the opposition - has hesitated between supporting the protests and remaining loyal to Mr Milosevic. Mr Draskovic has conspicuously avoided calling for the resignation of the Yugoslav leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in Leskovac, the local SPO leadership tried on Wednesday to take charge of protests against the regime. Interestingly, the protests dwindled after the SPO became involved. Scepticism of politicians of all stripes runs deep in Serbia today. And tension remains high in the only other remaining Yugoslav republic, Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pro-western Montenegrin government fears proposals by Belgrade to form a federal police force, which could overrule Montenegro's own force. The Montenegrin interior ministry said such preparations were &quot;yet another bid to destabilise the general situation in the republic&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the Nato bombing, government buildings in the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica, were protected by armed police against a threatened coup by army units loyal to Belgrade. Belgrade was publicly furious at Montenegro's refusal to offer support to Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Serb media are split in their reporting of the current situation. The independent tabloid Blic devoted most of yesterday's front page to news about the opposition protest. The pro government Politika by contrast remained silent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defying police beatings, tough words from President Slobodan Milosevic and harsh weather, hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters packed the snowy streets of the capital today in a boisterous 36th day of protests against Milosevic's nine-year rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tooting kazoos and whistles, lobbing firecrackers and chanting slogans, approximately 200,000 people formed a line that snaked through central Belgrade partly to demand democracy and partly to celebrate what many here believe to be a significant victory over Milosevic's supporters the night before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peaceful demonstration today was a blunt reminder that Milosevic's attempts Tuesday night to use his Socialist backers to smash the month-long wave of opposition protests failed. Socialist Party officials said they expected 500,000 Milosevic loyalists to converge on Belgrade Tuesday and scare off the opposition. But far fewer than 100,000 showed up, and it was Milosevic's boosters who were forced to flee the capital instead. In all, about 100 people were injured in street clashes between supporters of the opposition and Milosevic's loyalists and riot police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fighting erupted when Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia organized a pro-government demonstration at the same time and in the same place where the opposition demonstration was to be staged. It was the first attempt by the Socialists to demonstrate for Milosevic since the opposition began marching in the capital more than a month ago to protest the government's annulment of Nov. 17 municipal voting. The opposition won elections in 14 out of 19 cities, including Belgrade, the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole world can see that Serbia is the last bastion in Europe for this kind of government,&quot; said Vesna Pesic, an opposition leader. &quot;It is as if seven years ago the Berlin Wall did not fall. It is as if Serbia is an island in Europe where democracy has not reached.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of the opposition coalition, Together, said today they would continue protesting until Milosevic restores the election results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a joint news conference today, Pesic and another opposition leader dismissed signs of disagreement in their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and said they still wish for discussions with Milosevic and other Socialists as long as the government first recognizes Together's electoral victories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will accept dialogue on condition that he accepts the law,&quot; said Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic Party and the main strategist of the Together </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Vuk Draskovic, another opposition leader, ruled out any talks with Milosevic following Tuesday's clashes. One Democratic Party official said Draskovic's statement &quot;was an emotional overreaction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition statements appeared to be attempts to calm Western fears that Tuesday's violence threatened chances of a peaceful settlement of Serbia's biggest political crisis since 1991, when war came to the Balkans at what is widely held to be Milosevic's instigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear how the unpredictable Serbian president will respond to the continued protests or to the growing threat to his rule. In coming days, he will have several chances to defuse the situation and meet opposition demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement read on state television late tonight, police warned that all rallies must be organized in accordance with regulations, the Associated Press reported. One of those rules is that rallies cannot be held in city centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the important industrial city of Nis, 140 miles south of Belgrade, where Together says Milosevic's party stole an opposition victory, the local election commission began meeting today following a court decision ordering the panel to re-count ballots in 26 polling stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the 55-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is expected to issue its recommendations based on a visit to Belgrade last week by an OSCE delegation, which came at Milosevic's invitation to look into allegations of vote rigging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Djindjic and Pesic set out terms for a possible compromise with Milosevic. The pair said they would agree to new municipal elections quickly as long as Milosevic recognized their victories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic and Pesic also stressed that they wanted equal access to Serbia's electronic media, which are dominated by the Socialists. An estimated 80 percent of Serbia's 10 million people rely on state-run TV Serbia for their news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight, the state-run TV news called the pro-Milosevic demonstration a &quot;glorious&quot; and &quot;magnificent&quot; rally of the &quot;forces of peace and progress.&quot; In rhetoric filled with references to &quot;foreign plots,&quot; &quot;terrorism&quot; and &quot;Western schemes to destabilize Serbia,&quot; TV Serbia aired an unusually strong dose of pro-Milosevic programming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the opposition is installed in city halls throughout Serbia, especially in Belgrade, it would be in a strong position to affect the outcome of any subsequent elections. Under Serbian law, municipal governments are responsible for holding elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An air of defiance filled the crowd of protesters today. Ivanka Miljacki, a retired architect, said she was marching for her son and daughter. They emigrated to the United States because &quot;they saw no hope for people like them who aren't good at stealing and manipulation and all the other damnable skills needed to survive here,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miljacki said she stayed with the crowd Tuesday even though riot police charged waving batons. &quot;I was protected by big gentlemen,&quot; she said. &quot;We felt secure in our numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djordje Ristic, 19, a civil engineering student, walked with a placard taken from a Socialist demonstrator. The placard read: &quot;We don't want foreign flags.&quot; State-run media have said the presence of American and German flags among the protesters proved that the West funds the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a democratic gathering, so even their posters are welcome,&quot; Ristic said with a wide grin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The influential Serbian Orthodox Church called on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic today to resign in favor of a transitional government that would pave the way for early elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a six-hour meeting, the church's bishops, including some who have supported the Milosevic government, agreed to appeal directly to him as well as to Serbian President Milan Milutinovic to step down. Those resignations would relieve &quot;accumulated internal spiritual, moral, social and socio-economic problems . . . and the growing international isolation of the country,&quot; a senior bishop said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church's governing body, known as the Holy Synod and headed by Patriarch Pavle, asked Milosevic to resign in June, and the government responded by branding church leaders &quot;traitors.&quot; Today's decision represented a significantly broader appeal by practically the entire church hierarchy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the conference of bishops decided that Patriarch Pavle should not accept an invitation by political opposition groups to speak at a planned rally against Milosevic in the capital Aug. 19, according to Bishop Artemije, the church's top cleric in the Serbian province of Kosovo and one of the most outspoken opponents of Milosevic in the Holy Synod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artemije laid out the church's position in a statement he read on a local television station in southern Serbian city of Nis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We appeal to the presidents of Serbia and Yugoslavia . . . to immediately make way for other figures to take over the helm of state and take the people out of the cul-de-sac in which they have been driven,&quot; Artemije said. Milosevic's term expires in 2001, and Milutinovic's is up in 2002. Serbia is the dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement also strongly criticized international sanctions against Yugoslavia and the failure of an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo to stop attacks by ethnic Albanians on Serbs living there in retaliation for atrocities committed by Serb-led forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church's call for a new government came on the same day that a Yugoslav general who was dismissed as army chief of staff last year by Milosevic said he is forming a new political </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aimed at removing the Yugoslav leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Momcilo Perisic said his new group, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for Democratic Serbia, would seek to unite Milosevic opponents and work to bring about new elections. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will enter an opposition scene in which various political parties, alliances and ad hoc groups are working, so far without much cohesion, toward many of the same goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political future of Perisic, 55, has been the subject of intense interest here since he spoke out publicly against Milosevic for the first time late last month. Since then, he has come under sharp criticism from the government and the pro-Milosevic military leadership, which has accused him of taking the side of NATO in its air offensive against Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Milosevic entrenched in power and the political opposition in disarray, many people here have been looking to Perisic in the hope that he can provide some sort of alternative leadership and draw support for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> forces from the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, the lean, chain-smoking former three-star general lashed out not only at the Milosevic government but also at the Clinton administration, NATO, ethnic Albanian &quot;terrorists&quot; in Kosovo and the fractious political opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perisic said he was fired by Milosevic as chief of staff last November in part because he opposed using military force in Kosovo, favoring &quot;democratic means&quot; to deal with ethnic Albanian separatists there. But he said that once engaged, the army never should have withdrawn from the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had no knowledge of any atrocities committed in Kosovo by Serbian or Yugoslav forces but was sure that &quot;if there were any&quot; the army did not commit them. In addition to Yugoslav army troops, Serbian Interior Ministry police and paramilitary groups were active in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he criticized the NATO bombing campaign, Perisic said he wants to secure Western help to rebuild Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More quickly than the political opponents of Slobodan Milosevic had dared hope, grass-roots dissatisfaction with the Yugoslav President is surfacing across much of Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hostility toward Mr. Milosevic, bubbling up this week on the streets of the most unlikely of towns, has raised expectations among opposition politicians that Mr. Milosevic's survival in power might now be measured not in years, but in months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What has particularly raised eyebrows among political analysts -- who are beginning to doubt that opposition parties are capable of harnessing the anger -- is the surprise eruption of large and violent protests in the southern Serbian city of Leskovac, a long-time stronghold of the Milosevic regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, without the help of any political party, but with the participation of army reservists who fought in the lost war in Kosovo, more than 20,000 people marched on Monday night calling for Mr. Milosevic to resign. On Tuesday, about 2,000 people charged the local police station, demanding the release of the local television technician who had organized Monday's rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police responded with tear gas and by beating demonstrators with nightsticks. The crowd retreated and later attacked the home of a local political boss who belongs to the Yugoslav Left, a hard-line Communist party headed by Mr. Milosevic's wife. They smashed windows in the house and destroyed its front gate, a police official there said by phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Milosevic is in trouble in Leskovac, then he is really in trouble,&quot; said Aleksa Djilas, a historian and political analyst in Belgrade who is not affiliated with the opposition groups trying to force the Yugoslav leader from office. &quot;It is like a Kennedy being in trouble in Boston. This is the beginning of the end. I don't know when the end will happen, but it will be months, not years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presence of Yugoslav Army reservists in demonstrations in Leskovac is a wild-card element which, if repeated in towns and cities across Serbia, could tip the scales against Mr. Milosevic more quickly than opposition leaders had expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the end of the Kosovo war in early June, hundreds of reservists have intermittently blocked roads and bridges in central and southern Serbia, demanding their overdue pay for service during the 11-week war in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survival skills of Mr. Milosevic, who has been indicted on war crimes charges, should not be underestimated. Although he has lost four wars this decade while presiding over the implosion of the economy, he remains a shrewd politician. He has weathered eruptions of mass unhappiness in Serbia before, most recently in the winter of 1996-97, when three months of daily demonstrations all but paralyzed Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two major tools in his survival kit are an enormous state police apparatus, which is still believed to be loyal, and state television, which is the primary source of information for most of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a consensus among opposition leaders that Mr. Milosevic cannot afford politically to use his police to arrest, injure or kill large numbers of Serbs. As Zoran Djindjic, a key opposition leader, said at a rally on Tuesday night in the western Serbian town of Uzice, &quot;If there are a lot of us, they will not use force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, they expect Mr. Milosevic to do what he has done in the past: deploy his police and his large party apparatus to harass, intimidate and try to buy off the opposition. For instance, to disrupt an opposition rally planned for Thursday night in Prokuplje, Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party has called its own rally at the same place and time. He tried the same tactic two years ago in Belgrade, without much success in igniting street violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That leaves television, which is doing what it has done so effectively throughout Mr. Milosevic's 12 years in power. It ignores or distorts all the news that is bad for Mr. Milosevic and his family, while vilifying their rivals and critics as corrupt anti-Serbian traitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been almost no television coverage, for instance, of this week's trouble in Leskovac or of three large opposition rallies in Serbia in the past week. But there has been plenty of television footage of Mr. Milosevic handing out medals to war heroes and promoting the image of a country on the mend. These moments have been private ones engineered for television rather than public appearances that might draw protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they have been for years, opposition leaders in Serbia are divided about how to best plug into popular discontent, which is rooted both in anger about the lost war in Kosovo and fear stirred by the collapsing economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> led by the charismatic Vuk Draskovic, had insisted since the war in Kosovo ended that the time was not right for street demonstrations. As recently as Monday, Mr. Draskovic told a news conference that he is a &quot;legalist&quot; who wants to press for reform from within the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stunning news from Leskovac, which is controlled by Mr. Milosevic's Socialists but where the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the main opposition group, appears to have forced the hand of Mr. Draskovic. His party announced today that it would take charge of a rally in Leskovac on Thursday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior adviser in the party, Ognjen Privbicevic, offered this explanation for Mr. Draskovic's sudden and seemingly opportunistic change of strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vuk has such a good nose for these things,&quot; Mr. Privbicevic said. &quot;Things are changing so quickly here. Nothing is predictable. This is the first rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milan Bozic, the Deputy Mayor of Belgrade and a top leader in the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that all political parties in Serbia have underestimated both the depth of popular </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> feeling and its power to bring people to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of sudden, it looks as though frustration over Milosevic is much more deeply embedded into the national consciousness than we expected,&quot; Mr. Bozic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic, a key leader of the Alliance for Change, a coalition of opposition groups, and a rival of Mr. Draskovic, delivered a rousing -- if vague -- speech on Tuesday that envisioned simultaneous daily rallies in towns across the country as well as a general strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic said he expected the Serbian Orthodox Church, which last month demanded that Mr. Milosevic resign and which has since been bitterly condemned on state television, will soon join the opposition and ring church bells across the country to call Serbs out on the nationwide general strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing and the planning for that strike are not yet clear, said Milan Protic, also a leader of the Alliance for Change. He said the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not yet sat down with church leaders to ask for their help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Milosevic regime appears to fear the involvement of the church in politics. Politika, its main newspaper, today condemned church leaders for making peace in Kosovo with &quot;terrorist&quot; Albanian leaders and warned the church to avoid the &quot;murky waters&quot; of politics.<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key figure in the Serbian opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who fled during the war with NATO returned this evening and dared President Slobodan Milosevic to arrest him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoran Djindjic, a central figure in the opposition alliance that two years ago staged the largest and most sustained street demonstrations ever held against Mr. Milosevic, is facing up to 20 years in prison for avoiding military service during the Kosovo war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I do not believe Milosevic can take the risk to arrest me and provoke protests around Serbia,&quot; Mr. Djindjic said at the Belgrade airport, adding that he would appear in court here this week to defend his decision to flee the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic, 46, a philosopher and former Mayor of Belgrade who was educated in Germany, fled the capital in early May after he said he had received information that paramilitary thugs were planning to kill him.  Shortly before he left, a prominent opposition journalist, Slavko Curuvija, was shot dead in the street after being accused on state television of being a traitor. The Government news media and pro-Milosevic politicians made the same charge against Mr. Djindjic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the airport, Mr. Djindjic told reporters he had flown into Belgrade on Montenegrin Airlines, rather than drive through Serbia in a private car, so that Mr. Milosevic's police could not arrest him away from the glare of television cameras. He arrived from Montenegro, the small, independence-minded republic that with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic said he believed that the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> here had only a matter of months to force Mr. Milosevic from power before world attention wandered away from the Balkans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have not too much time,&quot; Mr. Djindjic said. &quot;If we have Mr. Milosevic in power after six months, it will be too late. The attention of the international community will focus on us maybe three or four months more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbian Orthodox Church has called for Mr. Milosevic's resignation, but it was not clear today how many of its priests had used their pulpits to preach on that theme. Serbian opposition parties are almost unanimous in wanting Mr. Milosevic replaced but are bitterly divided over almost everything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides the threat of being imprisoned by courts that Mr. Milosevic controls, Mr. Djindjic is facing daunting political problems inside the fractured opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been criticized by other opposition leaders for fleeing the country at a time of national crisis. Some of that criticism has come from inside his own Democratic Party, which he helped found and of which is president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of political analysts here say his standing as an opposition leader has been weakened by his decision not to stay with the people of Serbia as they were being bombed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic said today that he had been of more use to the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and to the future of Serbia by getting out of the country and lobbying European governments to give aid to individual cities where opposition to Mr. Milosevic was strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and many European countries have said that until Mr. Milosevic is removed from power, they will give only relief assistance to Serbia but will not help rebuild roads and bridges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic must also deal with the refusal of Vuk Draskovic, leader of the largest single opposition party, to join with smaller opposition parties in the Alliance for Change, an umbrella group that is staging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic, who accuses Mr. Djindjic of cowardice for fleeing during the war, has said that the time is not right for street demonstrations and that he wants to work from &quot;within the system&quot; to force Mr. Milosevic from power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if the opposition can succeed without Mr. Draskovic, a flamboyant politician who has proven able to bring tens of thousands of people into the streets, Mr. Djindjic said popular disgust with Mr. Milosevic did not depend on the personality of anyone in the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the feeling of the people is that they want change,&quot; Mr. Djindjic said. &quot;They cannot accept compromise. Those parties that cannot accept that should leave the political scene.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic said it was not he who was taking a risk by returning to Serbia, but rather Mr. Milosevic who, by staying on in power, risked his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The best solution for him would to go to The Hague,&quot; Mr. Djindjic said, referring to the International War Crimes Tribunal that meets there. &quot;He is very clever. Maybe he can explain himself -- I don't know.&quot;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With official vote results lacking, the Yugoslav leader gives no sign he will concede.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving to pre-empt President Slobodan Milosevic, the chief opposition candidate in Sunday's Yugoslav presidential vote declared victory Monday, and tens of thousands of his supporters held a huge party in Belgrade to celebrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his bold declaration, made in the absence of official voting results, Vojislav Kostunica appeared to be trying to demonstrate enough self-confidence and public support to force Milosevic to concede defeat. The opposition contends that despite widespread fraud and voter intimidation by the government, Kostunica carried the day on Sunday. Unofficial results gave him 55 percent to Milosevic's 35 percent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica said at a news conference Monday that if Milosevic challenges his claim, the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will &quot;defend our victory by peaceful means, and we will protest for as long as it takes. We will fight in democratic ways. The truth is our strongest weapon. We don't want to provoke internal tensions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union, the United States and other Western nations threw their weight behind the opposition, declaring that any claims of victory by the government would not be credible and calling on Milosevic to step aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Western powers view him as having directed a decade of ethnic warfare in the Balkan region and say he must leave if they are to lift economic and political sanctions on Yugoslavia. Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal by an international tribunal in The Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica made his victory announcement in a vacuum of reliable information about the actual results. Government election authorities have so far released only early figures, showing Milosevic in the lead. In any case, the opposition has declared itself unwilling to believe any official vote count, saying the numbers will be manipulated by the government to deny what they contend was a clear win by Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other opposition parties that fielded presidential candidates, the Serbian Radical Party and the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> both credited Kostunica with victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic, who has not appeared in public since he visited a polling station Sunday morning, gave no sign Monday that he is prepared to concede the election and resign. At the same time, police and other security forces under his control did little to obstruct the opposition rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday night in Belgrade - capital of both Yugoslavia and its dominant republic, Serbia - Kostunica supporters rallied in force, shouting such slogans as &quot;Save Serbia, kill yourself, Slobodan!&quot;&nbsp;Similar rallies were reported in many cities around Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Belgrade gathering, famed Yugoslav folk singer and dissident Djordje Balasevic made his first appearance in two years, having withdrawn from public performances to protest Milosevic's policies. No rallies were organized by the government Monday, after only a few hundred Milosevic supporters attended a Belgrade rock concert Sunday and suffered the taunts of participants in a larger Kostunica rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government appeared to be grappling through much of the day for a credible accounting of the election results, which analysts here think Milosevic had expected to win handily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are encountering a wall of silence,&quot;&nbsp;said Sinisa Nikolic, an opposition member of the Federal Election Commission. &quot;We are sitting here and asking what to do. We have no access to where computer results are being calculated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given Milosevic's tight control of the military and police, as well as his frequent use of repression to silence dissent, he retains the option of insisting that the vote was really in his favor and then cracking down on opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also could claim that a second round of balloting is needed because no candidate attained a majority of all votes cast Sunday. If he does, a runoff between the two top vote-getters - presumably Milosevic and Kostunica - would be held Oct. 8. But such a vote would hold new risks for Milosevic, because his opponents in Montenegro - Serbia's Western-oriented partner in the Yugoslav federation - who orchestrated a massive boycott of Sunday's vote within the republic, have said they would vote for Kostunica in a second round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legally speaking, Milosevic could concede defeat but remain in office until the middle of next year, to finish his current term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a Belgrade news conference Monday, Gorica Gajevic, a senior official of the ruling Socialist Party, said that with more than a third of the vote counted, Milosevic had won at least 45 percent. She added that she expected his vote tally to surpass 50 percent, ensuring a first-round victory. Gajevic also said she expects the Socialists to capture a majority of both houses of Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But another official in the ruling coalition, Ljubisa Ristic, conceded the party had suffered a major defeat in municipal elections that coincided with the presidential vote. Opposition leaders agreed, saying, for example, that the opposition had won 105 of 110 local assembly seats in Belgrade and 68 of 70 seats in Cacak, while in Novi Sad, Milosevic's Socialists won 11 of 90 seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoran Djindic, a leader of the 18-party coalition that backed Kostunica, said results from 60 percent of polling stations indicated Kostunica had won 55 percent of the vote, compared to Milosevic's 35 to 37 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition's claims of victory were based on tallies submitted by its election monitors, who stood by as government members of local election committees counted ballots throughout the country after the polls closed late Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In essence, we won everywhere,&quot;&nbsp;said Dragisa Djokovic, who heads Kostunica's Democratic Party offices in Mitrovica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Yugoslav law, the Federal Electoral Commission, which is stacked with Milosevic supporters, is responsible for verifying the local counting and declaring a winner. Officials on the commission refused to tell reporters why pro-Milosevic members of the body were in the Parliament building Monday, hours after police ejected the two opposition members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key opponent of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic insisted Tuesday on early elections and accused opposition rivals of seeking a civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections are &quot;the only realistic concept that could lead to the fall of this regime,&quot; Vuk Draskovic said in a news conference. &quot;I am sure Milosevic would lose such a vote.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic also criticized plans by other opposition parties to organize an all-out uprising against Milosevic in the next two months. He said such a move could only lead to civil war and help Milosevic stay in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Draskovic could not offer a clear strategy on how to force the autocratic Milosevic into organizing a democratic election, which would have to include loosening the reins on state-run media and allowing international election monitors into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can either count rifles or ballots,&quot; Draskovic said. &quot;The opposition must fight for conditions for democratic elections. We can demonstrate, but only to demand democratic elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His demand for early elections rather than Milosevic's resignation and the formation of a transitional government has split Serbia's fractious opposition parties. Their failure to unite in the past has ruined other chances to oust Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic's main rivals, Zoran Djindjic and his Alliance for Change, have spearheaded </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies throughout Serbia since June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a major show of discontent, about 150,000 people attended an opposition rally Thursday in the capital of Belgrade. The crowd jeered Draskovic, who proposed an early ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of opposition unity was discussed Tuesday in Montenegro by Djindjic, former Gen. Vuk Obradovic, and James Dobbins, the U.S. Balkan envoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A member of the opposition delegation, Vladan Batic, told the news agency Beta that the Serbs told Dobbins they would work to overcome divisions within the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic, once the most charismatic of all opposition leaders, lost much of his support when he joined Milosevic's government earlier this year. He was dismissed in May for urging a compromise with the West during NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rival Alliance for Change has gained strength since NATO took over Serbia's Kosovo province in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Djindjic said his group planned to increase pressure on Milosevic by organizing more protests and dismissed Draskovic's accusations that the protests could lead to civil war in Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic said Milosevic must resign or Serbia would plunge into chaos, hunger and political disintegration. He rejected the idea of a Milosevic-organized election, saying the government would rig the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some opposition officials worry that Milosevic wants to lure the opposition into early elections before he loses any more popular support and that Draskovic is helping him. Milosevic's ruling Socialists indicated last week that they would push for early elections as soon as November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, a group of Yugoslav army generals repeated earlier warnings that the army would intervene if violence erupted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAZAREVAC, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a lonely road south of Belgrade, a truck loaded with sand plowed into a convoy carrying Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic and four others to a Sunday picnic last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only Draskovic survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver of the truck has vanished, and the truck's tag number that could trace ownership has been wiped from official rolls. Witnesses are scared, and few Yugoslavs seem to harbor any doubt that the fiery Oct. 3 crash was an attempt to assassinate Draskovic, the strongest rival to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With thousands flooding the streets nightly for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies, Belgrade is abuzz with speculation that the crash means the president is nervous. Political observers are anxious to see whether Draskovic's brush with death will push him to join the rallies, a so-far ineffectual campaign to topple Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope Vuk will now wholeheartedly join the opposition, but we'll see about that,&quot; said Milan Protic, a leader of the Alliance for Change, which is staging the rallies. &quot;He's obviously under a lot of pressure - from all sides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic, 52, is the leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the largest opposition party in Yugoslavia, but his differences with other opposition leaders for years have hindered their efforts to oust Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest dispute, the Alliance for Change has taken to the streets since late September in a bid to remove the Yugoslav president and hold elections. Milosevic is considered vulnerable since an 11-week NATO air war devastated Yugoslavia last spring and forced him to cede control of the Serbian province of Kosovo to international peacekeepers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The powerful and charismatic Draskovic has stayed away from the protests. He wants the opposition to push for elections while Milosevic is still in office. But in recent weeks, Draskovic began sending signals that he was ready to join forces with the Alliance for Change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Oct. 3 crash, Draskovic and a group that consisted of his brother-in-law Veselin Boskovic and three bodyguards had set off from Belgrade for a picnic and political event. Boskovic drove Draskovic in an Audi sedan. The three bodyguards followed in a BMW.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to officials in the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the cars neared the village of Lazarevac, about 40 miles south of Belgrade, a large green truck swerved out of the oncoming lane and sideswiped the Audi. Boskovic died of a broken neck. Draskovic, knocked unconscious by the erupting air bag, suffered minor injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truck then smashed head-on into the BMW and burst into flames. The bodyguards died instantly. The driver of the truck had vanished when police arrived minutes later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, police have produced no information about the truck. The serial number is visible on its charred chassis, but police have not found the owner. The tag number - Belgrade 994-704 - is the only one missing from a long sequence of tag numbers in the registry of vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That police couldn't find the tag, the owner or the driver even after finding the chassis number is totally unbelievable,&quot; said Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attorney Borivoje Borovic, who is conducting an independent inquiry. &quot;Obviously, they don't want to get involved in this investigation in a meaningful way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While police have been questioning dozens of residents of Lazarevac, they have not interviewed Draskovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only substantive statement of any kind from police headquarters has been the assertion that Draskovic's convoy was speeding, which Draskovic denies. Authorities have referred the case to a local court in Lazarevac, which is treating it as a routine traffic accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic, officials in his party, and other opposition leaders quickly called the incident an assassination attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one has gone so far as to accuse Milosevic directly, however, and the regime has denied involvement. But in the tidy homes and shops that line the highway near the crash site, there is little doubt that someone powerful was involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to witnesses in Lazarevac, a new-looking green truck similar to the one involved in the crash was parked alongside the road at least four hours before the crash, which occurred shortly after noon. They said four men and a red Volkswagen Golf with no tags were there, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are afraid to talk about it now, but we all know about it,&quot; said Milos, 38, a Draskovic supporter who lives nearby and who is among the few people willing to talk in Lazarevac. &quot;This is a police state. People are afraid of what might happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Directed and written by Rob Stewart, Liza Vespi and Marc Vespi </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Classification: PG </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> **&frac12; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Right around the same time the heavy-metal band Anvil was about to be rediscovered, and Swedish filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul started searching for Sugar Man, the 47-year-old Canadian actor Rob Stewart embarked on his own odyssey of belated, documentary-boosted pop-culture reclamation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Stewart, who co-directs, co-produces and is the subject of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Slaughter Nick for President</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Brampton, Ont.-based, largely unemployed actor was living in his parents' suburban basement when he heard the news: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Tropical Heat</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (a.k.a. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Sweating Bullets</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), the Canadian-made </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Magnum P.I.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> via </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Baywatch</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> meets </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Miami Vice</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> detective show he'd appeared in back in the early nineties, was an object of high cult enthusiasm in Serbia. Not only that, but Serbia's top dissident punk band, Atheist Rap, had scored its biggest and most socially galvanizing hit with a catchy little high-velocity number called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Slaughteru Nietzsche</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - commonly translated as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Nick Slaughter, Serbia Hails You</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The song was not only popular throughout the country, it had attained anthemic status as the soundtrack to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the 1990s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Slaughter Nick for President</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tracks Stewart's journey from his parents' basement to Serbia in 2008 where he is confronted by the fact of a celebrity status he never knew he had. From his arrival at the airport, where he is greeted by one of the former leaders of the student uprising, ushered through a flash-bulbing mob and into a limo, Stewart is delivered a universe away from that Brampton basement. Throughout Serbia, he's so popular people call his name on the streets, approach him to sign </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Tropical Heat</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DVD collections, compel him to appear in daft TV commercials, and generally tell him how this late-night surf detective show helped them dream of freedom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's over the course of these discussions that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Nick Slaughter for President</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> acquires its heart and heft. As the music of Rodriguez did for the South African anti-apartheid </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the antics of the pony-tailed beach P.I. Nick Slaughter came to represent a kind of freedom and hope to young Serbians opting for democracy, the point where one of the country's more ubiquitous anti-authoritarian graffiti tags gave this movie its title: &quot;Slaughter Nick for President.&quot; Naturally, our boy from Brampton is flabbergasted. But he's also happy. Exceedingly so. Indeed, from the movie's beginning, Stewart's voiceover keeps telling us that this was one of the greatest experiences of his life and, while undoubtedly true, it also prevents the movie from taking on either the final emotional K.O. of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Anvil: The Story of Anvil</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or the slow-reveal dead-or-alive mystery that drives </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Searching for Sugar Man</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But what it does share with both is a sense of wonder at the sheer stubborn weirdness of the human drive for galvanizing symbols of liberation and release from tyranny, and how one culture's trash can become another's rallying cry for action. In this case, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Tropical Heat</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> caused a splash, sustaining a wave of revolt behind a charge of &quot;Surf's up!&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationwide anti-government rallies in Yugoslavia fizzled tonight, attracting only a modest turnout and underscoring how the opposition to President Slobodan Milosevic has been weakened by divisions within its leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Belgrade, the main event among rallies in 20 cities, no more than 20,000 people showed up, far fewer than the estimated 100,000 who packed the main square on Aug. 19 to demand Milosevic's ouster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Novi Sad, 5,000 turned out, half the total for a summertime rally. Turnout in other cities also was low. In Leskovac, for example, where 20,000 people showed up for an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protest more than a month ago, only 1,000 came today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The light turnouts bolstered Milosevic, who in early summer seemed to close to being removed from power in the aftermath of the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia and withdrawal of government forces from Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. In July and August, army reservists protested lack of pay, and anti-government demonstrations were well attended even in rural Milosevic strongholds. Tonight, protesters marched listlessly, passing people in cafes who seemed uninterested in the goings-on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rally? What rally?&quot; asked Goran Matic, a cabinet minister in Milosevic's government. &quot;This was an attempt of a rally. It only shows definitely and forever that the policy supported and financed by NATO countries has been defeated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results were a blow to Alliance for Change, a coalition led by political activist Zoran Djindjic. Djindjic has been battling Vuk Draskovic, who heads the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for leadership in the fight against Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two have differed over the strategy for unseating the government. Djindjic wants Milosevic's immediate resignation, followed by an interim government before new elections. Draskovic favors early elections that would eliminate the need for an interim government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent weeks, analysts here argued that unless the rivalry between the two is resolved, street protests would quickly lose fervor. Draskovic and his followers boycotted today's protests. Draskovic had threatened to boycott the August demonstration in Belgrade, but showed up after gauging the size of the crowd and deciding it was prudent to make an appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic put on a brave face. &quot;Even if 5 million people had shown up, it would not have finished the job. It's only the beginning and it's now or never,&quot; he told reporters. In a dig at Draskovic, he added, &quot;For those waiting, I don't know what they're waiting for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic called on followers to hold daily protests. The Alliance for Change also plans strikes and sit-ins, and student groups also plan demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic supporters struck an uncompromising stance. &quot;As we expected, the rally didn't succeed. Their idea didn't succeed,&quot; said Ognjen Pribicevic, an adviser to Draskovic, a former government minister who was ousted by Milosevic during the NATO air campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Belgrade's Republic Square, under a light rain, protesters shouted &quot;Slobo, Go!&quot; and &quot;Let's go on the attack!&quot; In conversation, they expressed both a desperation for change and skepticism that it would occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm here because it's my civic and patriotic duty. I'm here to bring meaning to my life and my children. We're living like rats because of his criminal activities,&quot; said Zorana Suvakovic, 48, an unlikely protester. She is a journalist at the government newspaper, Politika.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think 10 million people would have to come to get rid of him, and maybe that wouldn't even help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jelena Vudukovic, 47, a clerk at a tourist agency, said people fear demonstrations might lead to violence. &quot;People are afraid to show dissatisfaction. We don't want blood on the streets,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miroslav Bejovic, 36, a telegraph office worker said that after August he promised himself never to come to an anti-government rally again. He showed up tonight, reasoning that protest is an &quot;existential question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I've lost faith.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few police were on the street in Belgrade, although plainclothes men reported to each other on the mood of the crowd through walkie-talkies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Novi Sad, to the theme song from &quot;Star Wars,&quot; politicians promised to storm the local parliament building. But after heated speeches filled with attacks on Milosevic as a criminal and liar, the march on the parliament building petered out in silence while plainclothes police watched nervously from inside.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As thousands rally nightly to demand his resignation, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his allies are conducting an increasingly public campaign of intimidation, police harassment and economic blackmail against opposition leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across Serbia, authorities loyal to the Milosevic regime have arrested some supporters of the pro-democracy Alliance for Change, threatened others with violence or fired them from state-controlled jobs, and closed privately owned shops and restaurants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, the campaign seemed to enter an ominous new phase as Milosevic's powerful wife, Mirjana Markovic, launched a fierce rhetorical attack against Alliance for Change leader Zoran Djindjic, branding him a traitorous puppet of the West and a NATO spy. Meanwhile, the commander of the Yugoslav army vowed to defend the country against &quot;various internal enemies.&quot; And a bomb exploded at the home of an opposition leader in the eastern town of Valjevo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming shortly after a suspected assassin plowed a truck loaded with sand into a car carrying opposition leader Vuk Draskovic, the latest developments sent shock waves across Belgrade intellectual circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic has accused the government of plotting his murder. Another key figure in the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has taken to wearing body armor under a heavy jacket when he appears at rallies or goes out to dinner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't say anything,&quot; the flak-vested dissident pleaded, as he scanned the sidewalk outside a fashionable Belgrade restaurant. &quot;If they find out, I'm afraid they'll start aiming for my head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dissidents, journalists, and other observers of the Milosevic regime believe Milosevic is testing strategies to defuse calls for his resignation and for free and fair elections. Aware that a majority of Serbs would throw him out of office if given the chance to vote, analysts say Milosevic is disturbed that opposition factions have coalesced around a plan to begin a push Oct. 28 for early elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, Milosevic and his supporters appear to be carefully targeting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders - in Belgrade and smaller communities - as a way of intimidating others to stay home and keep their mouths shut. If that doesn't work, dissident leaders fear the regime may unleash a police crackdown against the marchers who have gathered nightly in towns across Serbia for the last 31 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the night of long knives is waiting for us,&quot; said Cedomir Jovanovic, a top Alliance for Change organizer. &quot;They're waiting for the opportunity to use extreme violence in such a way as to horrify Serbian citizens&quot; into submission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most wanted men in Serbia, Jovanovic, 28, is familiar with the regime's tactics. For the last two months, he has been sleeping in different apartments and switching cars during the day to avoid arrest by state security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charged this month with accepting cash from foreign intelligence agents and plotting to destroy the constitutional system, Jovanovic hides under a baseball cap and appears in public escorted by a cadre of marchers. Asked what would happen if police found him, Jovanovic, a movie buff, replied: &quot;Midnight Express,&quot; a film that depicts vicious conditions in a Turkish prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation outside Belgrade is even bleaker. Take Leskovac, a southern Serbian town controlled by Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) where spontaneous protests erupted about a month after international peacekeeping forces entered Kosovo on July 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue in Leskovac - ground zero of this year's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - was fury over the number of local men sent to fight in Kosovo. Nearly 70 percent of fighting-age males were mobilized in Leskovac, 20 miles from the Kosovo border. More than 80 died, though authorities admit to only 57.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 1, Ivan Novkovic, a technician at the SPS-controlled TV station, broadcast a diatribe against local SPS leaders during a championship basketball game between Yugoslavia and Germany. Four days later, 20,000 people - the largest crowd ever to assemble in the town of 80,000 - turned out to demonstrate against local leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the rally, Novkovic and two other rally speakers were imprisoned for nearly a month each. One of the speakers, Bratislav Stamenkovic, was fired from his job as a municipal development engineer. Earlier this month, Novkovic also was fired.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undaunted by police beatings the day before, thousands of opponents of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic protested in Belgrade on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite falling snow and frigid temperatures, the demonstrators marched peacefully through the city after street battles Tuesday when surging pro- and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> crowds clashed and police waded in to separate the groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday was the 36th successive day of what have become ritual protests with carnival-like overtones. Blowing whistles and trumpets and chanting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> slogans, the marchers snaked through central Belgrade, drawing waves and cheers of support from onlookers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowballs and firecrackers were thrown along the route, but there was no repeat of Tuesday's violence or massive police presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One local radio station put the size of the anti-government crowd at 100,000 people, about half the number the &quot;Together&quot; coalition fielded the day before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police, in a statement read on state television late Wednesday night, warned that all rallies must be organized in accordance with regulations. One of those is that rallies cannot be held in the center of cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrations began after Milosevic and his ruling party used its lock on government power to overturn opposition victories in Nov. 17 municipal elections in several cities and towns, including Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more than a month, the daily protests passed off without serious incident, but Milosevic's Socialist Party brought supporters into Belgrade Tuesday for a rally at the same time and place as the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition leaders denounced the move as a blatant provocation, and Belgrade's emergency medical center treated 58 people for injuries in the ensuing clashes. One man was in critical condition after a Milosevic supporter shot him in the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, leader of the opposition Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the clashes had let the genie of violence out of the bottle and marked &quot;the beginning of civil war in Belgrade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoran Djindjic, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, said, &quot;We have information that Mr. Milosevic yesterday reached a decision to ban rallying and that the state services are now getting ready to implement it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic all but programmed Tuesday's street battle by urging gove rnment supporters to rally at the same site where the opposition has been protesting regularly since his annulment of opposition victories in the Nov. 17 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's supporters and opponents clashed repeatedly and police weighed in with batons against the president's detractors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montenegro Backs Off</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign that Milosevic's grip on power may be weakening, the prime minister of Montenegro - Serbia's junior partner in the Yugoslav federation - warned Wednesday that his republic would take steps to protect itself from further international isolation resulting from Milosevic's policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leadership of Montenegro has been sympathetic to the Serbian opposition since the protests began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said Wednesday that Montenegro was prepared to conduct its own foreign policy if Serbia did not work harder to rejoin the world's nations, the Fonet independent news agency reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and France said they held Milosevic responsible for Belgrade's street violence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Street protests intended to oust President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia appeared to falter on their second day today, giving some comfort to a Government deeply shaken by the loss of Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 7,000 people turned out in fine weather for the rally here in the capital, compared with 20,000 on Tuesday. In Nis, about 8,000 gathered, compared with 20,000; in Kragujevac 5,000 attended, half of Tuesday's total. In Novi Sad, 5,000 came, compared with 7,000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials of the Alliance for Change, a loose coalition of opposition parties dominated by the Democratic Party of Zoran Djindjic, insisted tonight that the rallies and the campaign to oust Mr. Milosevic would continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 88-day-long protests of the winter of 1996-97 also started small, they said, and built slowly to large numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the starting time for Thursday's rally was moved up two hours, to 4 P.M., to catch people in town before they head home, and some officials said there were already discussions of how to play down the importance of the rallies in order not to discredit the Alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic, speaking at the Belgrade rally tonight, said somewhat plaintively, &quot;We are being asked whether the people have any more energy&quot; for the protests after 10 years of hardship and war under Mr. Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Loss of energy &quot;is natural,&quot; he said. &quot;But if the people don't find this energy we are doomed. This is the last battle, not just for our generation, but for our children and grandchildren. We have no other option but to be here every day, rain or sun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alliance officials said later that they might move more quickly to announce an alternative, transitional Government, to be headed by the respected former Central Bank governor, Dragoslav Avramovic, 79, or move to more confrontational tactics, like a general strike or road blockages. Another possibility, they said, might be an agreement by opposition-controlled cities to stop recognizing the authority of Mr. Milosevic's Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also seemed, in comments tonight, to be moving closer to the idea of using the rallies to press for early elections under fair conditions. This is the route favored by the largest opposition party, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which has dissociated itself from the rallies in the hope that they will fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leader, Vuk Draskovic, has said that if the opposition parties can agree on conditions for a free and fair ballot, he will join the protests in order to press Mr. Milosevic to call elections. The Alliance, however, has insisted that Mr. Milosevic resign first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight, Mr. Djindjic said that Mr. Milosevic would steal any election unless forced, by mass street demonstrations, to organize a truly fair vote. And Mr. Avramovic, in his speech, said that he would try to reach an agreement with other opposition parties on demands for free and fair elections and the country's democratization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Avramovic is clearly trying to unite the opposition, understanding that without Mr. Draskovic, however disliked he may be by the Alliance, the effort is likely to fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a continuing &quot;round table&quot; among opposition parties as they try to agree on conditions for a fair election. Mr. Djindjic boycotted 1997 elections as unfair, acting against American advice, while Mr. Draskovic took part, lending them legitimacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RADOVAN Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has never minced his words. He said at the weekend: ''If there is armed intervention over Sarajevo, Bosnia will turn into a new Vietnam. This is not an ideological but a civil war. We shall fight to the death.'' As he spoke, his men were withdrawing artillery and tanks from around the besieged city's airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Croat forces rampaging across Bosnia, Serb forces in retreat and Serbia on the international rack, to fight the world to keep an airport would be a foolhardy gesture at best. Taking the threat of military intervention seriously, the demoralised Bosnian Serb forces are turning to saving what they can.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bosnian Croat forces, backed by Croatia, are moving in a pincer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to cut the republic in two. They are also thrusting across the frontier near Dubrovnik to wreak revenge on Trebinje, where Serb troops besieging the Adriatic ports have their headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diplomats in Belgrade say the fear is that Croatia has been egging the Bosnians on to provoke the Serbs precisely to trigger a full-scale military intervention. If that happens, then Zagreb would seize the opportunity to drive Serbs from the UN-protected enclaves in Croatia and a bloody new cycle of vengeance and ''ethnic cleansing'' would begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Belgrade, official Serbia has been quiet about the impending threat of intrvention. President Milosevic insists that he is appalled by the shelling of Sarajevo, that Serbia has no territorial designs on Bosnia, and that his country is the victim of an ''international media conspiracy''. But the war that Mr Milosevic and his allies be-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gan a year ago has run out of control and opposition to Mr Milosevic is mounting. All the best-laid Serbian plans are on the brink of disaster.  Greater Croatia may yet arise from the ashes of greater Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sentiments grew, Crown Prince Alexander, the pretender to the throne of Serbia, yesterday addressed more than 60,000 people at an opposition rally in central Belgrade. Blowing kisses to the crowds, he yelled at the top of his voice: ''I am with you.'' Alexander Karadjordjevic, hitherto a British businessman, had returned to Serbia on Saturday as the opposition marshals its forces in a last-ditch effort to secure President Milosevic's resignation. But officials at yesterday's rally admitted disappointment at the turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Crown Prince Alexander who, because of international sanctions, was forced to return via Timisoara in Romania, visited striking Belgrade University students soon after arrival and urged them to keep up their protest against Mr Milosevic ''until the end''. The students gave him a rapturous welcome, chanting in unison: ''We want the king!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rally, which was held on Vidovdan, the day on which Serbs commemorate their defeat at the hands of the Ottoman Turks in 1389, was blessed by the country's Orthodox patriarch. The church, a traditional ally of government, has made its opposition to President Milosevic's government explicit, and yesterday the patriarch appealed for Serbs to resolve their differences without resort to civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The demonstration was organised by a new coalition, the Democratic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for Serbia, but the most important speaker was Vuk Draskovic, leader of the main opposition party. He called on the army and police to ''join the Serbian people'' and appealed to Mr Milosevic to go, saying that, if he did not, ''Serbia will be a corpse; people will pick at us''. Mr Draskovic said that a resolution of the present troubles could be found only if all Serbia's political </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> thrashed out the foundations of a transitional coalition government through round-table talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country is rapidly waking up to the fact that fresh trainloads of Serbian refugees will soon be coming from Croatia and Bosnia. It is also clear that, having bequeathed the Bosnian Serbs vast amounts of weaponry from the former federal army, they are now no longer at the beck and call of the Serbian president. Faced with military defeat, they will continue to fight rather than lay down their arms to save Mr Milosevic or to have sanctions lifted from Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even if Mr Milosevic bows to the protests, his immediate departure would no longer be enough for Serbs to extricate themselves successfully from the present predicament. A new Serbo-Croat war cannot be excluded. War in the south in Kosovo is also on the agenda. Having brutally repressed the autonomy previously granted to the two million Albanians who live in the province, no peaceful accommodation with Serbia is possible; but not even the most liberal Serbian opposition politicians can contemplate conceding Kosovo's independence or union with Albania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Milosevic's options are diminishing. Allies are deserting him and he has begun to resort to eccentric suggestions such as confederation with Greece.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a massive outpouring of opposition sentiment, more than 150,000 Serbs took to the streets of this capital tonight to demand the resignation of President Slobodan Milosevic and call for democratic change in Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ignoring last-minute political maneuvers by the government and veiled warnings of violence aimed at limiting attendance, the crowd clogged a vast area in front of the Yugoslav federal parliament building, waved opposition party flags and chanted slogans against Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally, the largest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstration in Belgrade since a series of protests against alleged election fraud in late 1996 and early 1997, went ahead peacefully despite some tense moments shortly after it started when a tear-gas grenade exploded in the crowd and briefly scattered protesters. They quickly regrouped, however, and there were no further incidents or reports of injuries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a half moon on a clear, warm night, speaker after speaker called for the resignation of Milosevic, who has held power here for the past decade, first as president of Serbia and since 1997 as president of the Yugoslav federation. Serbia is the dominant republic in the federation, which also includes Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the speakers was Vuk Draskovic, the mercurial leader of the largest opposition party, who had had a change of heart after earlier canceling his speech in a dispute over the appearance of a rival politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstration was widely anticipated here as a barometer of the public's attitude toward Milosevic in the aftermath of his disastrous policy in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo, which led to a 78-day NATO bombing campaign, the withdrawal of Serbian forces and the deployment of a NATO-led peacekeeping force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the crowd exceeded organizers' expectations, it was unclear where the protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will go from here. The opposition remains fragmented, and Milosevic has survived previous attempts to force him out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their speeches tonight, opposition leaders vowed to keep pressuring Milosevic to step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people are getting ahead of their leaders,&quot; said accountant Radisa Lejic, 45, referring to opposition politicians whose squabbling had threatened to reduce the turnout. &quot;This is the last minute for something to be done, and if we don't do it, then who else can?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government-controlled television network, however, called the rally &quot;a failure in every sense.&quot; It said the event was ordered by the opposition's &quot;NATO bosses&quot; and that Draskovic had shown up &quot;to fulfill a promise&quot; to Robert S. Gelbard, the State Department official who oversees U.S. Balkans policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Slobo odlazi,&quot; literally &quot;Slobo go away,&quot; the crowd frequently chanted, holding up a three-finger gesture of Serbian patriotism based on the Holy Trinity of the Serbian Orthodox Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Red bandits!&quot; yelled angry demonstrators after the tear gas exploded, a reference to the communist origins of Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to go back to Europe, where we were before communism and neo-communism,&quot; said Bishop Artemije, an influential Serbian Orthodox cleric representing Kosovo, in a message read for him from the stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another message to the crowd, Aleksandar Karadjordjevic, the London-based crown prince of Yugoslavia, urged opposition parties to stay out of any coalition with Milosevic, adding that &quot;the salvation of Serbia depends on this moment.&quot; Royalist supporters lit Roman candles and sang the Serbian royal anthem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Milosevic, look at this square,&quot; said Zoran Djindjic, a leader of the Alliance for Change, a coalition of opposition parties. &quot;This is where your citizens are. These are citizens who don't want you. Go away before we remove you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Milosevic does not resign in 15 days, he said, demonstrations will be held across Serbia until he does. &quot;Now it's us or them,&quot; Djindjic said. &quot;It's Milosevic or Serbia. There is no third way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic, who heads the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sounded a more conciliatory note. He criticized other opposition leaders' demands for a transitional government, saying that &quot;we cannot make a government in the streets,&quot; and he called for new elections by the end of November whether Milosevic presides over them or not. He thus appeared to be accepting offers by Milosevic's coalition to hold elections by then in what is seen as an attempt by Milosevic to ease the pressures for his resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many supporters of other parties booed the bearded firebrand as he delivered his oration, reflecting the ongoing divisions within the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic and other speakers criticized the presence of NATO-led troops in Kosovo, where they said that Serbs who are supposed to be under the force's protection are being kidnapped and killed by ethnic Albanians. Most of Kosovo's prewar Serbian population has fled the province over the past two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an apparent attempt to limit the rally's turnout, authorities canceled a number of buses and trains into Belgrade from Serbian cities and warned that &quot;unknown&quot; perpetrators could try to plant explosives at large public gatherings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the eve of the rally, Milosevic's Socialist Party also floated the idea of holding early elections, possibly by November. Spokesmen for the party and its coalition partners said they were &quot;ready&quot; for new elections any time and challenged opposition parties to name a date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move appeared to reflect a calculation that the opposition parties may be too deeply divided to win -- and that the situation can only get worse for Milosevic the longer he waits to take action. The government especially dreads the onset of winter, when the country is expected to face a heating crisis because of a shortage of electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political analysts also see the offer of early elections as a ploy to buy time so Milosevic can further undermine the opposition and defuse pressure on him to resign. Opposition parties are split on conditions for new elections, with some insisting that they should be held only after Milosevic steps down and once changes are made to election and media laws that favor his government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a recent poll by Belgrade's Partner agency, opposition groups have been gaining in popularity, but are still far from receiving majority support. If an election were held today, the poll of 1,000 citizens in 32 municipalities said, Draskovic's Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would get 18.1 percent of the vote, and the rival Alliance for Change would receive 14.8 percent. The three parties in Milosevic's ruling coalition would get a total of 24 percent, the poll indicated. Nearly 30 percent of those polled were either undecided or would boycott the election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SERBIA'S opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> planned fresh demonstrations yesterday, unbowed by bitter cold, snow and police pressure on the mass marches that have been disrupting the capital, Belgrade, for six weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty thousand people took to the streets in two separate protests on Saturday, one of them tolerated by police but the other swiftly blocked, although without bloodshed that marred protests earlier in the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President, Mr Milosevic, has riot police shunting protesters off the streets, where they had snarled traffic, into pedestrian areas to hold rallies while he considers his response to rising international pressure for democratic reform.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The turnout on Saturday paled beside peak numbers of more than 200,000 in the daily tide of demonstrations since November 19 against alleged election fraud by Mr Milosevic's long-ruling Socialist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Demonstrators' ranks were no doubt thinned by an onset of snow-blown sub-zero temperatures coupled with police pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But protesters have taken heart from an fact-finding mission by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, a pan-European security forum, that confirmed their complaints of rigging in municipal elections last month and urged Mr Milosevic to restore opposition victories in 15 of Serbia's biggest towns, including Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mission's findings have yet to be adopted by the OSCE, although most of its western members, including the United States, have led international condemnation of Mr Milosevic's refusal to admit his election defeats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have also blamed him for the violence on December 24 when the Socialist Party tried to stage a demonstration at the same time and place as Zajedno's daily protests, which previously were peaceful and good-humoured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report, which was expected after mission members said they had found blatant examples of election rigging, gave Mr Milosevic an exit route from the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diplomats said one of his options was to turn over the disputed towns but quickly order fresh municipal elections to restore Socialist Party rule, now facing its biggest threat in half a century of unbroken power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Zajedno could well boycott a new election without free access to the Yugoslav news media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic's alternative is to defy the judgment by the OSCE that the opposition won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of doing this would be increased isolation abroad, at a time when Serbia has been campaigning for much-needed Western economic aid after the formal end of war-related international sanctions, and the risk of the street protests in Belgrade spiralling out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Belgrade on Saturday 10,000 opposition supporters marched, shouting &quot;Slobo murderer&quot;, after the funeral of an activist who died in the riot on Christmas Eve. Thousands turned out for the funeral, also attended by the main leaders of the Together group, Mr Vuk Draskovic, Mr Zoran Djindjic and Ms Vesna Pesic. Police did not interfere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But police showed less patience with 10,000 students who tried to surge down a major city street after nightfall, swiftly diverting them into a pedestrian mall and trapping them there for an hour before they dispersed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic said Predrag Starcevic, 39, was trampled to death in the December 24 violence by a crowd trying to flee a police charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fifty people were injured in a melee between Zajedno and Socialist Party supporters. The Government then banned street marches. Another 29 were hurt on Friday when uniformed and plainclothes police assaulted Zajedno activists, witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic urged protesters on Saturday to shun violence but warned, &quot;There is a line beyond which a man no longer puts up with (State) humiliation and terror. Milosevic is trying to take citizens across that line to provoke bloodshed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) &Auml; Serbia's prosecutor general called for a ban on the largest opposition party Thursday, signaling a possible crackdown on President Slobodan Milosevic's political foes. The order against the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came a day after its leader, Vuk Draskovic, and his wife, Danica, were badly beaten in police custody. They were arrested late Tuesday during a protest in Belgrade that was brutally suppressed by police. Rioting exploded hours after Milosevic's Socialist Party and its extreme nationalist allies in the Radical Party ousted Yugoslav President Dobrica Cosic, a more moderate Serb nationalist, in a no-confidence vote. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's Serbia has helped to fuel the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of his vision of a &quot;&quot;Greater Serbia'' uniting Serbs in the former Yugoslavia. Hard-line nationalists opposed Cosic's efforts to end the war, but Serbia's opposition wants it to end so U.N. sanctions punishing Belgrade for its role in the violence will be lifted. Serbia's constitutional court would have to approve a ban on the party. But the mere threat was held over the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> head to keep it in check. Draskovic had a broken left arm, facial injuries, was dragging one leg and appeared barely conscious at police headquarters Wednesday, said Cedomir Efendic, a party colleague who was detained with Draskovic and saw him after the beating. The party leadership said in a statement that the Draskovics &quot;&quot;were physically tortured and their lives are in jeopardy.'' Senior party official Veselin Pavicevic appealed to the world to take action against Milosevic's &quot;&quot;fascist'' regime. Draskovic's attorney found the opposition leader and his wife in Belgrade's central jail late Thursday. The attorney, Borivoje Borovic, did not see his clients, but told the Tanjug news agency that the head of the prison had insisted they be examined by doctors. There was no word on Draskovic's condition. Draskovic is expected to go before magistrates today to decide whether he remains in custody, Borovic said. In a statement carried by Tanjug, the prosecutor general's office accused Draskovic's party of inciting Tuesday's unrest and said it should be banned for organizing the protest and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations in March 1991 and June 1992. The statement also said the party repeatedly had demanded the violent overthrow of existing authorities. &quot;&quot;The party crudely abused the constitutional freedom of political activity,'' the statement said. Vladimir Gajic, general secretary of Draskovic's party, dismissed the prosecutor's charges as &quot;&quot;ridiculous.'' &quot;&quot;It's an attempt to introduce the crime of mere thought,'' he said. Gajic said the party has demanded the resignation of the government, but not its violent overthrow. He added that the opposition had expected to be banned if further unrest followed Tuesday's riots, in which a police officer was killed and more than 30 people were injured. But leaders did not call for more demonstrations, and a strong police presence kept the streets quiet. Leaders of Serbia's fractured opposition have feared a crackdown since it became clear Monday that Milosevic, who had recently adopted a more moderate stance, had allied with extreme nationalists who threaten his power. In unusually direct criticism, Russia's Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the removal of Cosic and the crackdown on demonstrators &quot;&quot;worry us as evidence of mounting tension within the country, and of the development of anti-democratic trends.'' But the fact that Draskovic, the best-known Serbian opposition leader and a recent guest of President Clinton, could be detained and severely beaten seemed intended to underline the authorities' power to act as they please. The reliable Borba daily said dozens of the 121 people arrested during the protest were given 60-day jail terms Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to 50,000 people took to the streets of Belgrade yesterday as protests demanding the resignation of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic seemed to gather strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the sixth day of antigovernment demonstrations, the protesters marched through the capital chanting &quot;Slobo Go&quot; and &quot;Red Bandits&quot; as they passed government buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 40,000 demonstrators also rallied Saturday evening in Belgrade.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growing number of protesters over the weekend injected new life into a campaign that had seemed in danger of running out of steam after a slow start last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More and more people are coming,&quot; said opposition leader Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party. &quot;We hope the trend will continue,&quot; he told Radio Index.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition group Alliance for Change launched the rallies in towns across Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic, on Tuesday. The organization has vowed to continue with the daily demonstrations as long as necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters blame Milosevic for Serbia's growing economic hardships and isolation after a decade of Balkan bloodshed, including NATO's 11-week air war against Yugoslavia to stop Belgrade's repression of ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though the weekend rallies attracted bigger crowds than those of previous days, the turnout still only represented a fraction of Belgrade's population of two million. And antigovernment rallies elsewhere in the politically isolated Balkan republic were much smaller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But opposition activists were increasingly upbeat, saying they were on the right track. &quot;This has clearly gained momentum,&quot; Alliance coordinator Vladan Batic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drawing parallels with successful street protests in 1996, which only gradually gained momentum to peak at more than 200,000 in Belgrade, activists hope that the new drive will develop in a similar way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic has set a target of two million protesters across Serbia, saying this would show that people want change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alliance for Change, representing one wing of the divided opposition, wants Milosevic to resign and the establishment of a transitional government, followed by free elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who helped organize big crowds during 88 days of protests in 1996-97, has refused to take part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have kept a low profile, but government officials have ridiculed and condemned the protests, branding opposition leaders as &quot;traitors&quot; and &quot;NATO lackeys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tanjug state news agency, in a commentary, described the street protests as a &quot;total fiasco&quot; and dismissed the Alliance for Change as an instrument of the West.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbia's influential Orthodox Church has emerged as a key player in the growing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to topple President Slobodan Milosevic as it seeks to unite the country's divided political opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church, which until recently had largely remained outside politics, is sponsoring a rally in Belgrade this month that organizers hope will bring out the masses and haul feuding opposition leaders together under one banner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure that party rivalry is kept to a minimum, the G17 group of independent economists behind the Aug. 19 protest is urging participants to leave party emblems at home and to bring Serbian flags if they want to wave something.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By putting the rally under the umbrella of the Orthodox Church, G17's energetic 35-year-old co-ordinator, Mladjan Dinkic, has overcome the rivalry of the two main opposition leaders. Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party and Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Party (SPO) have each refused to support any initiative organized by the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to opposition officials, both leaders have promised to attend the rally in front of the Yugoslav parliament. It would be the first antigovernment demonstration in the capital since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 11-week bombardment of Yugoslavia, although protests have been going on elsewhere for the past month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic and Mr. Djindjic, whose party is part of the Alliance for Change umbrella group, worked together three years ago during weeks of student and opposition protests over election fraud. The demonstrations rocked Mr. Milosevic's regime to its core.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But relations between the two plunged when Mr. Draskovic stood in 1997 general elections boycotted by the Alliance for Change, and eventually joined the government, although he was sacked in January for appearing to question its Kosovo policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Orthodox Church began emerging in the political arena last year when the spiritual leader of the ethnic Serb minority in Kosovo, Bishop Artemije, joined moderate Serbs in condemning the repression of ethnic Albanians by Serb forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kosovo was lost in February last year when Milosevic's regime started solving the Kosovo problem by force. That's when we lost Kosovo,&quot; Bishop Artemije told a recent rally in the town of Valjevo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an unprecedented move, the church's Holy Synod came out in June with a call for Mr. Milosevic and his regime to step down, and for a national unity government to replace it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Work on creating such a government of experts, which would rule for a year to prepare free elections and economic reforms, has been going on for some time by the anonymous but influential G17 group of economists, politicians, church leaders and intellectuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while nobody questions the good intentions of those involved in the project, the problem remains that until Mr. Milosevic steps down (and he shows no sign of doing that) or they find a constitutional way to remove him, their plan is just a piece of paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are putting the cart before the horse,&quot; one local analyst said. &quot;The big question is not a transitional government, it is getting rid of Milosevic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Aug. 19 rally could bring out a huge crowd that would increase the pressure on Mr. Milosevic, analysts doubt whether it could achieve the &quot;critical mass&quot; that might persuade the embattled leader to quit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only thing the regime is really afraid of is desperately hungry people coming onto the streets,&quot; one analyst said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbia's fractious medley of opposition parties agreed to leave their differences behind yesterday and join a united front aimed at ousting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic from power, one party leader reported after a six-hour political meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''All the participants except Momcilo Perisic signed the agreement,'' said Vladan Batic, a co-ordinator of the Alliance for Change coalition, one of the two key partners in the newly unified opposition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, leader of the country's main opposition force, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO), had called the talks with a plea for squabbling to end among Serbia's many </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourteen of the country's 15 opposition parties agreed to adopt the joint strategy, Batic reported, with Perisic - a former Yugoslav army chief-of-staff - standing out as the only dissident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic said ''we are all satisfied'' with the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They approved documents aimed at concentrating opposition efforts on forcing Milosevic to call early national and regional elections by April, which they hope he will lose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A joint call was also to be made to the European Union and the United States to lift sanctions against Yugoslavia if Milosevic agrees to the election demands, and to respect UN resolutions on Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties represented in the meeting included Kosovo Serbs, Momcilo Trajkovic and Bishop Artemije, who opposed Milosevic's policy in the strife- torn southern province. Also present were representatives of Serbia's Muslim and ethnic Hungarian minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If the opposition does not agree now it will show it is not ready to take over power,'' Trajkovic said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The son of ousted Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic was charged yesterday with threatening to hack up a resistance activist with a chainsaw and throw the parts into a river. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The indictment, the first official charges issued against the unpopular Marko Milosevic, said he and six associates ordered Zoran Milovanovic to identify the leaders and publishers of the Otpor </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in March, 2000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marko Milosevic switched on the saw and &quot;threatened to cut him up and throw him into the Morava River,&quot; says the indictment by the Pozarevac district public prosecutor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once described by the United States as one of the richest and most violent members of the Serbian mafia, Marko Milosevic fled the country on a false passport after an uprising ousted his father last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Known for his bleached haircut and flashy lifestyle, the former race driver has since been reported to be hiding out in Russia or in another former Soviet republic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His father is awaiting trial in The Hague on war-crimes charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marko Milosevic ran a business empire in Pozarevac. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His holdings included an amusement park called Bambiland and the Madona nightclub. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His many critics in Serbia say Marko Milosevic was involved in shady and lucrative cigarette and oil dealings during his father's turbulent rule, allegations he has denied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accusations have flown between his associates and activists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At one stage, protesters who complained that they had been assaulted found themselves accused of attempted murder, prompting large demonstrations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Criminal charges have been filed before against Marko Milosevic over separate incidents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, however, was the first official indictment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given his uncertain whereabouts, it is not clear how the authorities will proceed with the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 100,000 demonstrators filled Republic Square in central Belgrade yesterday in a major rally against President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the first protest by all parties in the Serbian opposition to take place in the capital since August last year and a crucial litmus test of support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high turnout will be a major boost to the beleaguered opposition leaders. Analysts have long said that because Belgrade is the intellectual and political centre of the country, it must provide the impetus for change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally saw the leader of the Democratic Party, Mr Zoran Djindjic, and his long-time rival, Mr Vuk Draskovic, head of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sharing a stage together and calling for free and fair elections in Yugoslavia at all levels: local, republic and federal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The regime are the traitors,&quot; said Mr Draskovic. &quot;They have betrayed everyone. They have made one million citizens beggars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our flag is not in Kosovo any more,&quot; he said. After the rally, Mr Slobodan Vuksanovic, a key official of the Democratic Party, said: &quot;The atmosphere was terrific. There was a very good turnout and we can say it was very successful. It was just one more proof that people are strongly supporting change and want the opposition to be the tool by which change is brought about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixteen leaders of different opposition parties spoke during the rally, which lasted for more than three hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very important that so many people are here. It's a message to the opposition leaders that they have to stop their eternal bickering,&quot; said one doctor who attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The number of people is absolutely terrific. The result is that probably people will have more optimism and faith in democratic forces here. But this has to be just the first of many rallies,&quot; said Mr Velko Popovic, a journalist and member of the Social Democratic Youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police kept a low profile during the rally. A helicopter hovered overhead for a while and small groups of police stood some distance away, but offered no provocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Youths from the students' resistance organisation, Otpor, had walked to the rally, starting the previous day from the northern city of Novi Sad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters blocked key roads in the centre of the capital for the rally in which youngsters waved flags of support from the main opposition parties and shouted: &quot;Red Gang, Red Gang&quot; - an anti-communist slogan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state-controlled television Politika was running a major movie marathon, showing films such as American Beauty. Many interpreted this as an attempt to keep people at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists from Spain attempting to enter the country the day before the rally were held at Belgrade airport and not allowed entry, despite having valid papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four Japanese, one Canadian, a German and two American journalists were also reported by an independent radio station to have been refused entry. Local radio reported that a number of opposition supporters who were coming to the capital by coach had been stopped by police who insisted on carrying out technical inspections of their vehicles, in an effort to delay them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only non-government television station, Studio B, which sought to carry the rally, was subject to heavy jamming and lost transmission totally when its transmitter suffered an unexpected power failure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> POLICE IN the Yugoslavian capital Belgrade last night continued with a second wave of crackdowns against anti President Milosevic protesters, widening their raids to include the offices of an outspoken independent newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last night, as protesters took the streets for the 10th day in a row, police waded in with batons and arrested 21 demonstrators. Early this morning, police sealed off the offices of the Glas Javnosti newspaper and banned it for 15 days. They then sealed off the headquarters of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alliance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest moves followed Wednesday night's clashes. In front of the Nato -bombed government buildings in Milosa Velikog Street thousands of demonstrators ran into cordons of hundreds of police, who brutally halted an opposition march heading towards the villa of President Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police, in full riot gear, beat up 20 protesters, scattering the demonstration, and arrested 13 opposition activists during the night. It was the first police intervention in nine days of peaceful marches organised by the opposition grouping, the Alliance for Change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milan St Protic, a leader of the alliance, suggested that the police aggression showed that &quot;Milosevic is nervous&quot;. Senior members of the alliance vowed to continue staging regular peaceful protests and to avoid violence at all costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The marches, by tens of thousands of protesters, have been small compared with the mass </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations of 1996 and 1997. In the earlier unrest, the police - considered to be the President's &quot;Praetorian guard&quot; - waited for weeks before using force against protesters. It remains a mystery why the police went to such lengths to stop the marchers this week when they were more than a mile away from Mr Milosevic's official residence at Dedinje. It is common knowledge here that he has not lived there since it was wrecked by Nato missiles in April. Many doubt that he lives in Belgrade at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vuk Draskovic's Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the biggest opposition party, which has stayed away from the protests so far, strongly condemned the police violence saying the use of force showed that the regime was &quot;virtually demanding a bloodbath in Serbia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For months now, a public debate has been continuing over whether the crisis in Serbia will descend into civil war, or even end in the violent overthrow of President Milosevic, similar to the downfall of Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania a decade ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One side believes that Mr Milosevic will not hesitate to use force to quell the protests and stay in power, causing inevitable bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others say that growing poverty, combined with deep animosity towards the Yugoslavian leader and his powerful wife, Mira Markovic, could lead to events similar to those in Romania in 1989. There is agreement that Mr Milosevic is not ready to go willingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the leaders of about 18 opposition parties held their first round -table talks aimed at agreeing conditions for any future elections in Serbia. The Serbian official media described Wednesday's violence as an attack by &quot;a group of hooligans; sympathisers of the alliance for Nato&quot; against the police, who were carrying out their &quot;regular duties&quot;. The Interior Ministry issued a statement saying that &quot;among the perpetrators were known criminals, drug addicts and hooligans who make trouble at sports events&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OXFORD, England</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vojislav Kostunica is one of the gloomiest men I know. This may be an advantage for a new president of whatever remains of Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the miracle happens and Slobodan Milosevic, who is denying that Mr. Kostunica won an absolute majority in the presidential election and insisting on a runoff, goes without bloodshed, gloom will still be in order. A new federal republic of Yugoslavia will have a ruined economy, like Romania after 1989; a burden of guilt, like Germany after 1945; ubiquitous corruption, like Russia today; and still unresolved ethnic-territorial issues, like, well, old Yugoslavia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Who is the man upon whom such a heavy burden may fall, if he becomes president? Large, gray-suited, quiet-spoken, painstakingly analytical, Mr. Kostunica talks more like an academic than a politician. Indeed, until 10 years ago, he was just that -- a constitutional lawyer and a political scientist. Now 56, he has been an active party politician only since 1989, when non-Communist party politics became possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first time we met, in 1997, during the last great </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations, he took me to an old-fashioned restaurant in central Belgrade and told me he really believed in the original Yugoslavia -- that is, the Serb-dominated unitary kingdom that existed between the two world wars. (His father was an officer in its royal army.) It was, he said, or at least should have been, an exercise in nation-building under a British-style constitutional monarchy. Look how the king had given his first son a Serbian name, his second a Croatian name and his third a Slovenian one -- rather as British monarchs deliberately called their heir the Prince of Wales. Croats, Slovenes and Bosnians would find that a rose-tinted view of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for today, he explained at great length, a new Yugoslavia needed what he called asymmetric federalism -- with different rights and powers for the different component parts -- as a solution for Kosovo, Montenegro and Vojvodina, and perhaps also for the Serb republic in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vojislav Kostunica is a very serious man. Solid. Consistent. Knowledgeable and capable of sophisticated rational argument. Principled, too. But hardly a bundle of fun. Short on charisma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is he a great believer in the politics of the street. During the 1997 protests, he told me that he was wary of the demonstrators' cult of spontaneity, their belief in &quot;the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; as an end in itself. Yet his own future, and with it that of all southeastern Europe, now depends on his ability to lead a peaceful, inventive, effective </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of mass protest and civil disobedience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late 1998, we met in the spartan office of his tiny opposition party, the Democratic Party of Serbia. His talk was all of Kosovo and how its future inside Serbia must be secured by constitutional, peaceful means. Ordinary, decent Serbians would be dismayed at what Mr. Milosevic was doing there, he said. In an election held under international supervision, Mr. Milosevic could be defeated. Fat chance, I thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year later, after the war and the NATO bombing, which he criticized fiercely, the office seemed even more spartan and bare. This time, he was furious with the United States and Britain. TonyBlair! Robin Cook! He spat out the names of the British prime minister and foreign minister with contempt. &quot;But,&quot; he added, &quot;I know they are not the West.&quot; The West was also Henry Kissinger, whom he took to be a critic of the Kosovo war, and Noam Chomsky and Harold Pinter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So is Mr. Kostunica a &quot;moderate nationalist,&quot; as some newspapers are calling him? What exactly is a moderate nationalist? Some old Yugoslav hands, shocked by his strong support for the Bosnian and Kosovo Serbs, say he's as bad as Slobodan Milosevic. Some even say he's more deeply nationalist than Mr. Milosevic, the post-Communist opportunist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is both true and completely false. It's true that Mr. Kostunica has been more seriously and consistently concerned about the fate of the Serbian nation than Mr. Milosevic. In other, happier places and times he would be a conservative, romantic patriot of the kind frequently encountered in the British Conservative Party (and they have some pretty rose-tinted views of the national past, too). In this unhappy place and time, he has said and done things he should regret: being photographed holding an automatic weapon among Kosovo Serbs, for example, whatever his explanation for the incident is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I have no doubt that he is genuinely moderate -- and what matters is his moderation. It is not just that he is supported by a coalition of democrats who are less nationalist than he is. He is himself, in his style and intellectual formation, profoundly committed to using civilized, peaceful, constitutional means. And one lesson of Europe's terrible 20th century is that the means you embrace are quite as important as the ends. Perhaps more important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a man who is passionate about the rule of law. Who believes in elections, institutions, negotiations. And he sees that the only future for his country lies in a return to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Mr. Kostunica gets a chance to show if he has it in him to become a popular leader of a peaceful, negotiated revolution, we shall see. But human beings can grow with a great challenge. History makes the most unlikely heroes. He may yet be one.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A flurry of high-level meetings this week in New York, Washington and Zagreb has served to underscore the west's impotence in the face of mounting evidence that Slobodan Milosevic will perpetrate a massive fraud in Yugoslavia's September 24 presidential election. US officials said that Mr Milosevic was making &quot;substantial preparations&quot; to rig the poll. The EU admitted it was &quot;worried&quot;. Speakers at the Balkan stability pact summit in Croatia, warning that the stakes could not be higher, urged Serbs to &quot;vote wisely&quot;. But they all know the truth in this context of Stalin's remark, recycled by the EU's Chris Patten, that &quot;it's not who votes that matters, it's who counts&quot;. And while the diplomats deliberately toned down their remarks for fear of inflaming Serb nationalist opinion, they also know that if Mr Milosevic succeeds in his fraud and suppresses any resulting domestic protests with his usual ruthless efficiency, there is precious little Nato's political masters can or will do about it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not all gloom. Opinion polls currently suggest a victory (in a fair fight) for the leading </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, behind whom most opposition parties have coalesced. Resistance groups like Otpor, the student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would-be election monitors like the non-governmental Centre for Free Elections, human rights advocates like Natasa Kandic, and independent media bravely lead the way in defying state and judicial persecution, police torture and worse. &quot;He's finished!&quot; has become the rallying slogan for those who would be rid of this appalling man. But in his first campaign appearance, in Djerdap on Tuesday, Mr Milosevic made brutally plain what he thought of them. The nation's choice was between &quot;heroes and traitors&quot; in Nato's pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the &quot;heroic&quot; steps Mr Milosevic has in store are said to be up to 1m ghost votes, a modern version of Gogol's dead souls, which will supposedly be cast for him in Montenegro (despite an official poll boycott) and Kosovo; forged ballots, personation, and doctored electoral rolls; no independent verification; media censorship and blanket propaganda; and the intimidation of state employees, pensioners and public housing tenants. And if he still looks like losing, he may yet manufacture a military crisis with Montenegro's pro-western leadership. All this the west, lacking a firm, coherent Balkan strategy, is powerless to prevent. Better have some more meetings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THOUSANDS OF Serbian students took to the streets yesterday to protest at a government crackdown on universities in an attempt to stave off a campus revolt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Serbian Education Minister, fearing mounting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> discontent might foment student unrest when the opposition is stepping up protests in major cities, had banned all gatherings at universities. The order served notice that the summer term was to end immediately, a week early, and students would be allowed to enter universities only to sit their exams.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Various student associations have threatened to call for a general university strike in line with civil disobedience plans of several opposition parties campaigning for an end to the rule of the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic. As thousands flooded to the main square in front of a university building yesterday, busloads of riot police drove up and parked in nearby streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The students spelled out their list of demands, including one to the authorities to enable a &quot;peaceful transition of power&quot;. They asked all those &quot;responsible for Serbia's demise to leave&quot;. The students also called on all citizens to start non-violent resistance, and urged the opposition to &quot;by personal example, give impetus to a wide national rebellion against state terrorism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has accused the broadly popular student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor (Resistance), which was joined last week by prominent university professors and personalities, of terrorism, fascism and betraying the national interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milosevic supporters say Otpor is linked with Nato countries involved in the 11-week bombing campaign against Serbia last year. Every day, 20 to 40 Otpor members of all ages from across Serbia are taken in for questioning, an Otpor source told The Independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Tuesday, masked men attacked Belgrade University students on a sit- in protest at a city-centre building. Security guards of an unknown origin were posted yesterday at university buildings, checking that only registered students were entering. It was impossible to establish whether they were police or security firms linked to the regime. &quot;This is the end of the autonomy of the university as we knew it,&quot; said Marija Bogdanovic, former dean of Belgrade School of Philosophy.The Serbian opposition plans another </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally this afternoon, following last week's closure of the popular independent Studio B radio and TV. But the opposition is being increasingly criticised for its perceived mild approach to Mr Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For days, rumours were circulating in Belgrade that Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the main opposition Serbian Renewal Party (SPO), had been in contact with Mr Milosevic's socialists, seeking a deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SPO runs Belgrade at the local level and controlled the now-silenced Studio B. Mr Draskovic's adviser, Ognjen Pribicevic, was forced to publicly denounce the rumours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without mentioning Mr Draskovic by name, smaller opposition parties criticised what they called his &quot;moderate approach&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sir: The assertion by many &quot;democratic&quot; Serbians that there will be no real peace and stability in the region unless Serbia embarks on the road to democracy is, unfortunately, specious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Serbia's free, multi-party and largely fair elections of 1990, the two main Serbian nationalist parties (of which Milosevic's SPS was one) polled 63 per cent of the vote; two years later, at the height of the war in Bosnia, where Serbian forces had displaced over two million Muslims and Croats in under six months - and went on to kill at least 200,000 Bosnians - Milosevic polled 56 per cent in Serbia's presidential election, hardly the record of a dictator.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sad truth is that no candidate who espoused the admirable values of democracy and a liberalised economy came close to capturing the Serbian public's imagination. That is why, even during the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations of 1996 and 1997, the person presented by Serbia's &quot;democrats&quot; as the answer to their country's problems was the ultra-nationalist Vuk Draskovic; members of his Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were actively involved in atrocities in both Croatia and Bosnia, and Draskovic himself now serves in Milosevic's government as Deputy Prime Minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbia's political culture has been built on what the independent Serbian journalist Stojan Cerovic called &quot;the constant, obsessive theme of building a Greater Serbia&quot;. This involves &quot;purifying&quot; Serbia by &quot;cleansing&quot; it of non -Orthodox people and &quot;extending&quot; Serbia so that it mirrors the nationalist ideal of encompassing Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo and the Sandzak, something which can only be accomplished by genocide.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POZAREVAC, Yugoslavia, -- The son of ousted Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic was charged yesterday with threatening to hack up a resistance activist with a power saw and throw the parts into a river.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indictment, the first official charges issued against the unpopular Marko Milosevic, said he and six associates ordered Zoran Milovanovic to identify the leaders and publishers of the &quot;Otpor&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in March 2000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(Marko) switched on the power saw and threatened to cut him up and throw him into the Morava River,&quot; the indictment by the Pozarevac District Public Prosecutor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once described by the United States as one of the richest and most violent members of the Serbian mafia, Marko Milosevic fled the country on a false passport after a mass uprising ousted his father last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renowned for his bleached haircut and flashy lifestyle, the former racing car driver has since been reported to be hiding out in Russia or another former Soviet republic. His father is awaiting trial in The Hague on war crimes charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marko Milosevic ran a small business empire in Pozarevac, which his parents see as their hometown, including an amusement park called &quot;Bambiland&quot; and the &quot;Madona&quot; nightclub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His many critics in Serbia say Marko Milosevic was involved in lucrative and shady cigarette and oil dealings during his father's turbulent rule, allegations he has denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accusations have flown to and fro between his associates and activists with whom they clashed. At one stage, protesters who complained they had been assaulted found themselves accused of attempted murder, prompting large demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal charges have been filed against Marko Milosevic before over separate incidents, but this was the first official indictment. Given his uncertain location, it was not clear how the authorities would proceed with the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Razi Nurullayev was seized by the Azerbaijani police three weeks ago near his home in Baku, dragged away and jailed for five days for being a democratic nuisance. A week earlier, on a main street in Minsk, Yauhen Afnagel and 100 other young Belarus democracy guerrillas staged a political stunt. They demonstrated for half an hour, holding pictures of a &quot;disappeared&quot; opposition politician and then ran for cover before President Alexander Lukashenko's police could arrest them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Uzbekistan, meanwhile, a few dozen Tashkent students switched their lights off together in a synchronised show of defiance last week - a small gesture of protest, but risky and daring given the murderous regime of President Islam Karimov; and perhaps the start of something bigger.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The activists involved in all three incidents linked up in Albania yesterday to form a transnational network of young democracy fighters - a student international aimed at toppling dictators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rotten regimes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Nurullayev, Mr Afnagel and one of the Uzbek student organisers who cannot be named for their own security were among hundreds of young revolutionaries who gathered in Tirana at the weekend to celebrate the downfall of several rotten regimes and plot the overthrow of current dictatorships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is the first time something like this has happened - it's great,&quot; said Ivan Marovic from Belgrade, a veteran of the Serbian Otpor youth </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that helped bring down Slobodan Milosevic five years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The activists danced, drank and then got up in the morning for earnest arguments about &quot;knowledge proliferation&quot;, &quot;flash mobs&quot;, Foucault, the value of logos and corporate branding, political marketing, the meaning of politics and how to maximise subversive impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We mocked the power as much as possible,&quot; said Alina Shpak from Kiev, explaining her Pora </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> triumph in unseating the old Kuchma regime in last winter's Orange Revolution. &quot;You can't be afraid of someone you're laughing at.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From the Chinese frontier to the borders of the EU, the vast post-Soviet space has been in the grip of revolutionary fervour over the past few years - a second wave of democratisation after the 1989-91 revolutions symbolised by the fall of the Berlin Wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Young veterans and strategists of the Orange, Rose and Cedar revolutions in Ukraine, Georgia and Lebanon, as well as of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> uprising, were joined in Tirana by Albanian youngsters organised to fight everything from illegal Italian waste dumping to corruption and violence against women. Alongside them were student leaders hoping to emulate the success of their peers against the daunting dictatorships in Belarus, Azerbaijan and in Uzbekistan, where President Karimov has just demonstrated his ruthlessness by massacring hundreds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We all consider your chains our own,&quot; declared the Albanian youth leader, Erion Veliaj, 25. &quot;We hope you all reach a non-genetically modified democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the revolutionary class of 1989 comprised middle-aged dissidents and intellectuals graduating from underground bookclubs to the barricades, the class of the new millennium is a revolutionary vanguard that is media savvy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their tools are the internet chatroom and the text message, the logo and brand recognition, the eye-catching flyer and pithy sloganeering. These outfits are non-hierarchical, decentralised, nominally leaderless and organised with militaristic precision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our idea was to use corporate branding in politics,&quot; said Mr Marovic of Serbia's Otpor, which has become the model for parallel </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> across the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has to have a marketing department. We took Coca-Cola as our model.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As well as acting as an ambassador, training revolutionaries in other countries, he is also developing a computer game - A Force More Powerful -with programmers in the US. You win by outwitting and toppling regimes through techniques of non-violent guerrilla activism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the gathering in Tirana seemed like a student campus, the talent and determination of the young organisers were obvious. Aided by western support, advice and funds, they have chalked up a series of stunning victories - three in four years - in Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003 and Ukraine in 2004. Other young protesters have taken part in mass action in places such as Kyrgyzstan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Controversy has raged over the precise role of the west, and the US in particular, in financing and directing the revolutionaries for &quot;regime change&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the Serbs and the Ukrainians, for example, benefited from US support and money, the Uzbeks and Azerbaijanis are bitter about the lack of American backing in the face of formidable repression. &quot;The US was pushing for regime change and was ready to invest millions of dollars,&quot; Mr Marovic said of the Serbian scenario. &quot;The funds were there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Double standards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others accused Washington of double standards for singling out Belarus and the regime of Alexander Lukashenko as a target for overthrowing while tolerating the Karimov and Aliyev regimes in Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan because the first is useful to the US military in Afghanistan and the second is crucial to American oil interests in the Caspian basin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Americans don't want a revolution in Azerbaijan after 13 years of dictatorship,&quot; Mr Nurullayev said. Last month he met the US ambassador in Baku to plead for help for his organisation, Yokh, which means &quot;no&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has not heard back from the US embassy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yokh is a new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of 100 activists, styled on Serbia's Otpor, Ukraine's Pora, and Georgia's Kmara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We can't go on the streets and hand out our flyers. It's too dangerous,&quot; said Mr Nurullayev.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Baku is a windy city. Yokh has just had a million flyers printed, declaring: &quot;No to corruption, No to dictatorship.&quot; They will be dumped at high spots in the city at night to be picked up by the gusts and scattered across Baku.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Tashkent, too, the lights-off action last week was a first tentative step by the democracy guerrillas to challenge Mr Karimov, fight the fear and mobilise the young.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tirana gathering heard about the launch of Bolga (The Hammer), a small group of Uzbek students at home and in the diaspora inspired by the Georgians and the Ukrainians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bolga's organisers declare: &quot;What is our task? To take actions to disperse fear and silence in our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What is our goal? To hold free elections, create a free society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What is the Bolga </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a democratic and leaderless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Uzbek youth. We throw away the trash of totalitarianism from our minds. We are street cleaners, so we wear orange clothes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Energised by their first networking experience, the youth leaders declared themselves all for one and one for all, aping the Nato treaty's stipulation that an attack on one organisation will be taken as an attack on all of them. There was a touch of the evangelising of the born-again congregation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Turn to your neighbour, look them in the eye and say to them, 'You are not alone,'&quot; Mr Veliaj urged the gathering. A common declaration adopted yesterday stated that &quot;each fight is our fight&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Serbian opposition will be celebrating Orthodox new year tonight in a greater state of harmony than at any stage since the end of the Nato bombing campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rival opposition parties are encouraging their supporters to come together at an open-air New Year's Eve party organised by the students' resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Republic Square in Belgrade, the scene of ultimately doomed protests last year against the rule of President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hitherto feuding opposition is congratulating itself on the signing of a 'historic agreement' earlier this week in which 15 political parties adopted a joint strategy aimed at securing early presidential, parliamentary and local elections in Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At their festivities the students are to name their men and women of 1999, and more than a few opposition leaders will doubtless be hoping to find their names on the list.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'We, the leaders of the democratic opposition, decided to once again demand from Milosevic and both Yugoslav and Serbian parliaments to agree to call early elections by the end of April.' said a spokesman for the controversial and charismatic opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The demand for elections was accompanied by a threat of renewed anti -government protests starting in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The action plan was the initiative of Mr Draskovic, who is trying to assume the role of overall leader of the Serbian opposition. He appears to believe that his moment has come after the failure of his rival, Zoran Djindjic, to galvanise public support during a countrywide protest campaign last summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision by all the main opposition parties to support the strategy indicates a new pragmatism and a tacit admission that opposition disunity has alienated the people of Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beyond the demand for elections, Mr Draskovic's blueprint outlines a strategy for rehabilitating Serbia internationally. It contains proposals for the lifting of sanctions against Belgrade once the authorities agree to elections and for the readmission of Serbia into the Organisation for Security and Co -operation in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To avoid accusations of selling out to the west, the opposition also calls for Serbian troops to be allowed to return to Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic is adopting a softly softly approach to political change rather than the top-to-bottom shake-out advocated by some of his younger opposition rivals. Notably absent from his blueprint is the demand for the immediate removal of President Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic is meanwhile courting disaffected members of Mr Milosevic's ruling Socialist party of Serbia, who are alarmed at the growing influence in government of the president's wife, Mira Markovic, and her associates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbian sceptics argue that Mr Draskovic is not interested in reforming a system which benefits the ruling elite, but merely in changing who is at the top. Political analysts believe he may be seeking an exit strategy for Mr Milosevic which would allow the Serbian leader to retreat from power without facing prosecution on war crimes charges by the international criminal tribunal in the Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic, however, shows no signs of wanting a way out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Sloba and Mira have learnt that it is possible to rule without popular support,' said Bratislav Grubacic, a Belgrade-based political analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The authorities have made it clear that presidential and parliamentary elections are not on the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'There is no parliamentary crisis in Serbia to give a reason for calling early elections,' said Ivica Dacic, the Socialist party spokesman, adding that elections were needed only at the local level, in towns and cities where opposition parties controlled local councils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government is widely expected to call local elections in the spring, capitalising on recent changes to the voting system which should favour the Socialists and their allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a sign that the display of opposition unity is rustling government feathers, the authorities have started a campaign to discredit Mr Draskovic. The federal information minister, Goran Matic, showed journalists a videotape in which an alleged spy claimed to have put Mr Draskovic in contact with the French secret services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic, who already claims to have been the victim of a state-sponsored assassination plot, has rejected these allegations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Serbia, Aug. 22</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his influential wife, Danica, find themselves at a political crossroads, suddenly less radical than many of their supporters, their commitment to the ouster of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia called into question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having built a reputation as fierce and combative leaders of the opposition to Mr. Milosevic and his powerful wife, Mirjana Markovic, the Draskovics now have money, power, position and a lot to lose -- making them much like the tightly knit Milosevics themselves, whom they detest but to whom they are often compared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Draskovics control Belgrade, its many business opportunities and its powerful television station, Studio B -- all at the sufferance of Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And their efforts to find a peaceful way to oust Mr. Milosevic, to negotiate with him for new elections while trying to subvert him, has confused some of their followers and helped keep the opposition divided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was glaringly evident at a large </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally on Thursday in Belgrade, which drew up to 100,000 people. When Mr. Draskovic realized how many had shown up, he felt compelled to crash the rally he had refused to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bearded Mr. Draskovic is normally a compelling orator, a kind of rock star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his speech, calling for early elections and not Mr. Milosevic's immediate removal, was too moderate for the crowd, marking a strange new episode in his career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Draskovics' desire for political power and dominance among the varied opposition leaders has led them to make various deals with the authorities while holding to the idea of fundamental democratic change. As they alternate between opposition and cooperation -- what critics call opportunism -- more people ask whether they have any other real aim beyond power. Tonight on Studio B, Mr. Draskovic defended his caution, saying it would be easy to call for civil war. &quot;I am Milosevic's opponent, but I am also opposed to a single head rolling,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't want people to get killed because of Milosevic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many disappointed despisers of Mr. Milosevic say the Draskovics have become afraid of revolutionary disorder, corrupted and coopted, more interested in replacing the leader at the top than in destroying his system of crony capitalism and special favors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some suggest that they are so driven by an intense personal hatred for their erstwhile coalition partner of only three years ago, the Democratic Party leader, Zoran Djindjic -- an animosity fully reciprocated -- that the fight for supremacy within the opposition has overshadowed the fight against Mr. Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such charges infuriate Vuk and Danica Draskovic, now 53 and 54 respectively. In a recent, four-hour interview at their comfortable home, Ms. Draskovic said bitterly: &quot;Who led the demonstrations in 1991? And '93? And '96? Who led the fight in the streets? Who went to jail?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But each time it has been Ms. Draskovic, a former judge forced to resign in 1973 by the Communists for refusing to jail a jobless man, who has pushed her husband, the orator and mover of crowds, to act boldly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late 1996, during enormous street protests that ultimately forced Mr. Milosevic to grant the democratic opposition their victories in local elections, Ms. Draskovic was captured on television urging protesters to take clubs and march on Dedinje, where Mr. Milosevic lives, and to seize power from the thieves who had stolen the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether it was time now -- after the loss of Kosovo -- to urge people to take clubs to Dedinje again, Ms. Draskovic answered immediately, &quot;Yes, it's always time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic said nearly as quickly: &quot;No. No one wants a civil war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a tension that has defined their relationship, which is strong and mutually dependent, between the smart, aggressive daughter of a Chetnik -- a monarchist guerrilla during Nazi occupation -- and the son of a proud Partisan, a fighter with the victorious Communist Tito.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were law students in 1968, the year of student upheavals throughout Europe, when they first met and dated, and took part in protests here against social injustice, inequality and &quot;the red bourgeoisie,&quot; the party bureaucracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tito promised reforms, exhilarating Mr. Draskovic and the others, who danced and shouted, &quot;Tito we love you!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Danica Boskovic, Mr. Draskovic remembered in a 1990 interview with On magazine, was utterly contemptuous of the half-Croatian Tito and of their faith in him, and she exploded when Vuk tried to pull her into the celebratory kolo, or dance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What kolo?&quot; she demanded. &quot;That bandit, that Ustashe&quot; -- a Croatian fascist. &quot;He's cheated us and fooled us just to get us to calm down. I thought you were smarter than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk said: &quot;Don't speak that way about Comrade Tito. Get into the kolo.&quot; And Danica said: &quot;Choose: him or me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course I chose Tito,&quot; Vuk said, &quot;and I seem to remember I pushed her away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week later, Tito reneged and called the students counterrevolutionaries. &quot;I repented,&quot; Vuk said, &quot;and for four years I tried to exchange one word with Danica, in vain. She would not see me for four years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a true story, Danica said, laughing. Why did she relent? &quot;Vuk changed,&quot; she said. &quot;He left the party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when is confusing. Communist Party membership was a necessary ticket for employment in journalism, and he worked for the Tanjug press agency from 1969 until 1978, when he was yanked from Lusaka, Zambia, for making up a border war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that charge was nonsense, that he had had ideological troubles, but he then worked for the official trade union newspaper in Belgrade. He said he had given up on the party, but actually he was expelled from it in 1982, when he published the fiercely nationalist novel &quot;Knife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The novel reopened many of the nationalist and religious issues that Tito had suppressed but which helped break apart the country, with so much bloodshed, after his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Combined with Mr. Draskovic's deep and mythic Serbian nationalism -- &quot;I'm a victim of my metaphors,&quot; he said as he expressed his love for the dead multiethnic Yugoslavia -- his wife's anti-Communist credentials have given their Serbian Renewal Party a considerable reach into provincial Serbia, where the more citified intellectuals of the Democratic Party do less well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her fury at the expropriations and hypocrisies of Communism have helped drive her toward action, she says, and without question helped him toward political prominence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was arrested by Mr. Milosevic's Serbian government for the first time in March 1991, after a huge opposition demonstration against the unrelenting propaganda of the state television, which the protesters called &quot;TV Bastille.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policemen and demonstrators clashed, and as the marchers faltered, Danica, standing with Vuk on the balcony of the National Theater, yelled at him: &quot;What are you waiting for? Shout, 'Forward!' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did. One policeman and one student died, and he was arrested for a few days, but he had earned his reputation as &quot;king of the streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 1, 1993, there was a street riot in Belgrade after Mr. Milosevic -- then President of Serbia, one of the republics making up the Yugoslavia -- engineered the sudden impeachment of the federal President, the nationalist writer Dobrica Cosic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic led a march through Belgrade. But it was Ms. Draskovic who called on protesters to storm the federal Parliament. She was filmed on state television saying, &quot;We should get inside, beat up the police and bust up the whole building&quot; and asking demonstrators, &quot;Where are your guns and your bombs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple were arrested about 1:30 A.M., and both were beaten badly by the police. Ms. Draskovic was beaten by the chief of the city's police, Rade Markovic -- now Director of State Security -- and she is said to have behaved impressively, cursing the police and the Government with blood pouring from her mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic, in a separate cell, reacted differently. He wrote a letter, later published in a newspaper, full of pathos to Ms. Markovic, Mr. Milosevic's powerful wife, begging her to free Danica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Danica and I have no children,&quot; he wrote. &quot;To me, she is my wife and my child and my whole family. While she is in jail, my entire family is in jail. Help her, esteemed Ms. Markovic, and you will have helped me, too. I would be endlessly grateful to you, as long as I live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Draskovics were in jail or prison hospitals for some 40 days before they were freed on July 9, flown to Paris by Danielle Mitterrand, the wife of the French President at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are persistent reports that Mr. Draskovic wrote a second letter from jail, promising Mr. Milosevic that if his wife was released, the street demonstrations would stop and his party would &quot;disarm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple deny that there was any unpublished letter, but there is no question that Mr. Draskovic moved into more conventional politics and showed an increasing willingness to deal with the authorities to get a share of power and, it is said, money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were already signs of that a year before. In the local elections of 1992, a democratic coalition including his party won the upscale Belgrade municipality of Savski Venac, a district covering Dedinje, a wealthy area with many embassies and official houses. At the inaugural session of the local legislature, Mr. Draskovic struck a deal with Mr. Milosevic's Socialists and dropped a coalition partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Draskovic's brother Veselin Boskovic took over the department that managed municipal &quot;construction grounds&quot; -- in other words, he controlled building permits and vacant city land. Accusations of graft and corruption, including cash bribes for building permits, were so plentiful that he was forced to step down, despite denials, in part because Mr. Milosevic's party kept a dossier on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after the opposition won Belgrade in the 1996 elections, Mr. Boskovic was given responsibility for the same department -- only for all of Belgrade. Again, there have been numerous accusations of bribery and graft, of payoffs for permits, which he and Ms. Draskovic have denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic's chief of security, a former bodyguard who was a member of a short-lived Serb Volunteer Guard that Mr. Draskovic sent to Croatia to fight in 1991 when that republic seceded from Yugoslavia, was also appointed manager of the large Tasmajdan Sports Center in downtown Belgrade. There, as with parking lots, tickets are paid for in cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roksanda Nincic, a political reporter for the liberal Vreme magazine, says one of Mr. Draskovic's problems &quot;is that he's organized a corrupt government that hasn't put Danica's family in influential places so much as in places where cash flows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Draskovic has another brother and six sisters, and in the interview, she listed all of them and their professions to refute persistent allegations that she had granted them or their husbands leases for lucrative shops in good locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Milosevic's Socialists -- who keep Mr. Draskovic in power in Belgrade by not voting against him in the city council -- are widely believed to have the means to harass and prosecute Mr. Boskovic and other party and family favorites, a stick they use, Draskovic rivals say, to keep Mr. and Ms. Draskovic in line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Draskovics also see control of Studio B, the Belgrade television station, as vital to any relatively fair election campaign -- another reason, some suggest, that he is not eager to defy Mr. Milosevic too fiercely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also helps explain why Mr. Draskovic agreed to take part in the 1997 Serbian elections, which Mr. Djindjic and most of the other opposition parties boycotted, against American advice, as unfair because of a lack of truly independent news media and outside electoral observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election was credible only because Mr. Draskovic took part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as he moved more fully into conventional politics, his wife was perceived as too visible and influential. Like Hillary Clinton, she pulled back from the open play of politics -- a decision her husband announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even today, he is defensive on the topic. &quot;She has influenced me more than you think but less than normal,&quot; he said. &quot;She influences me most when her stand is close to mine, but not if we are opposed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is fiercer than he is about himself, it seems. In the interview, she remembered being infuriated by reading, on her second day in jail in 1993, a newspaper citing Mr. Djindjic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said we got what we deserved,&quot; she said bitterly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr. Draskovic agreed later to go into the Zajedno coalition with Mr. Djindjic in 1996, &quot;we were very close to divorce,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said, a touch sarcastically, &quot;He said, 'I must save Serbia, I must save my people.' And what happened?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You were right,&quot; Mr. Draskovic said. &quot;Zajedno was a big mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early this year, Mr. Draskovic shocked more of his supporters when he went into Mr. Milosevic's federal Cabinet as a deputy prime minister, citing the crisis in Kosovo and the need for national unity, while saying he remained, at heart, in opposition, working to change the system from the inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He became the acceptable face for the Government, its spokesman to the West, yet he also criticized Mr. Milosevic and his wife for manipulating Serbian patriotism for narrow political goals. That finally got him dismissed before the war in Kosovo ended, allowing him to revive his opposition credentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he is accused of making another deal with a desperate Mr. Milosevic, favoring early elections in November. Mr. Draskovic denies any deal and says elections are the only way forward. But what he defines as pragmatic politics, aimed at power, is increasingly seen as opportunism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet his rivals have no clearer notion of how to oust Mr. Milosevic, other than hoping to do it in the streets.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Hundley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Belgrade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MORE than 100,000 Serbs turned out on a warm August evening to vent their frustration with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the man who has led their country to military defeat, economic ruin and international isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoran Djindjic, one of leading figures in Serbia's fractious opposition, issued an ultimatum to Milosevic: resign within 15 days or face daily demonstrations and prolonged nationwide strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This time we will carry on until the end,&quot; Mr Djindjic told the protesters. &quot;Either he goes or we do.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police kept a low profile, and the rally outside the Yugoslav parliament building remained peaceful. There were some tense moments, however, when a tear-gas grenade tossed into the densely packed crowd nearly caused a stampede.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally was organised by a newly formed group of independent economists who aim to create a transitional government of experts that would repair the economy, normalise relations with the West and prepare the country for internationally supervised elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time for Milosevic to go,&quot; said Milovan Pavlovic, a 71-year-old retired mechanic from southern Serbia, who travelled by bus to Belgrade to take part in the demonstration. He said he was disappointed by the turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was hoping for two or three million. These are dark days for Serbia and we will probably need a miracle to get rid of Milosevic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition leaders had said they wanted to hold off on rallies in Belgrade until they had developed a clear strategy for ousting Milosevic. Yesterday's demonstration was the first in the capital since the winter of 1996-97, when nearly three months of daily street protests against Milosevic ultimately failed because opposition leaders began bickering with each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the largest opposition party, is the most charismatic, erratic and perhaps mistrusted figure in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp. Two days before the Belgrade rally he withdrew as a speaker without explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were reports in the Belgrade media _ denied by Mr Draskovic _ of a secret meeting between him and Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But halfway through yesterday's rally, he suddenly and dramatically strode up to the speaker's platform, touching off a brief scuffle between his bodyguards and those of arch-rival Mr Djindjic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His theatrical appearance touched off loud jeers and cries of &quot;traitor,&quot; which were quickly drowned out by ecstatic chants of &quot;Vuk, Vuk&quot; from supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key opposition figure who kept his promise to stay away from the rally was General Momcilo Perisic, a former army chief of staff who leads the newly formed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for a Democratic Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Perisic, who was fired by Milosevic more than a year ago, is seen as a reluctant politician who has taken up the cause as a patriotic duty. He said he would not address the Belgrade rally because &quot;the goals of the meeting are not clear&quot; .</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PROTESTERS were rallying in Belgrade's Republic Square last night as the Serbian government threatened to introduce a stringent anti-terrorism law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rally was a crucial test of credibility for Serbia's political opposition, which has drawn fierce criticism for lacking leadership during the country's escalating crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past week, the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has ratcheted up the tension, arresting activists from the student-based resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor and brand ing its members 'terrorists', 'traitors' and 'agents of Nato'. In the wake of growing activism from the wider student body, it closed universities on Friday - making campuses no-go zones for all but those entering faculty buildings to take examinations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Details of the anti-terrorism law have not been released, but analysts fear it may allow indefinite detention, arbitrary closure of non-state media and the disarming of citizens who hold guns; effectively introducing a state of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime will not be drawn on introducing the law, but top Socialist Party member Nikola Sainovic said last week: 'The Socialist Party believes we will be successful in the fight against terrorism and against Nato.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The work of Otpor has a violent character, disrupts public peace and order and the security of the country - and these activities will be prevented,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor activist Slobodan Homen responds that it is Otpor's non-violent character that gives it popularity and strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Otpor insiders, polling from Milosevic's own party shows that Otpor outstrips the ruling Socialist Party in popularity. They say that Otpor has 28 per cent of popular support and Milose vic only 14 per cent. The stakes were high for the opposition yesterday. The number of protesters attending and the performance of speakers was crucial to bolstering credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Homen says that Otpor activists do not want power. 'We don't want to be members of parliament. We just want to get rid of the regime.' Homen says that Otpor has delivered an unequivocal message to the opposition: 'We are ready for a campaign of civil disobedience. We can stop exams in the faculties and we can organise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'If you are not willing to take appropriate steps, we will do it alone.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BELGRADE (AP) - Yugoslav fans chanted calls for President<BR> Slobodan Milosevic to resign during a soccer match between<BR> Yugoslavia and Croatia yesterday, one day before a major<BR> anti-government rally in Belgrade.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During a 45-minute break due to a power outage, Belgrade fans shouted slogans such as ''Slobo, go away,'' ''Slobo, Saddam,'' and ''Slobo, you sold Kosovo. '' Many also chanted ''The rally is tomorrow,'' referring to today's protest, which organizers hope will attract more than 100,000 people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the first game between the national teams of the former wartime enemies since Croatia became the second Yugoslav republic to break away when the federation began to disintegrate eight years ago. The qualifying match for next year's European championship ended in a 0-0 tie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an effort to blunt the rally's impact, Milosevic's Socialist party offered yesterday to hold early elections, The offer fell far short, however, of opposition demands that Milosevic step down and allow a transitional government before any elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''We believe that there are more important things on the nation's agenda than the elections, but if the opposition wants that, so be it,'' Ivica Dacic, a Socialist party spokesperson, said. ''We are ready.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elections are technically scheduled for 2001. Milan Bozic, of the opposition Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said his party would agree to early elections, but only under international control. Democratic party deputy Ljiljana Lucic said early elections would be just another attempt at vote fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And another opposition leader fled Belgrade yesterday for Montenegro, the rebellious province whose government opposes Milosevic. Vesna Pesic, of the Civic Alliance of Serbia, fled one day after Milosevic's prosecutor demanded her investigation for allegedly calling for the toppling of his regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Waves of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests began in Serbia, the dominant Yugoslavia republic, after the 78-day NATO air campaign left the country badly damaged, impoverished, isolated and without control over the southern province Kosovo. The air campaign aimed to force Milosevic to accept a peace plan for the separatist province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, 20,000 people rallied in the country's third-largest city, Nis, chanting: ''Resignations, resignations!'' Similar rallies in Belgrade in 1996- 97 pushed Milosevic to make concessions. He later took advantage of power struggles among opposition leaders to backpedal on the deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition leaders have still been unable to forge a common front. One key player, Vuk Draskovic, who in the past has led the largest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests, will not attend today's rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. State Department spokesperson James Rubin said U.S. officials have met with opposition leaders and encouraged unity to hasten Milosevic's departure. The U.S. has financed Yugoslav groups which promote pluralism, but Rubin denied any U.S. role in today's planned protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said most Serbs now oppose Milosevic. One poll published yesterday said more than 70 per cent want him out of office. Rubin added opposition sentiment has spread to the military.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ONE OF Serbia's leading political players yesterday threw his weight behind the opposition protests that are daily weakening the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vuk Draskovic, the charismatic leader of the Serb Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO), announced that his party would back opposition demonstrations beginning this weekend. Mr Draskovic claimed that this would bring large crowds on to the streets for the first time since the huge demonstrations that came close to unseating Mr Milosevic two years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday 7,000 protesters turned out in the western Yugoslav town of Valjevo to demand Mr Milosevic's resignation. Some protesters broke through a glass door and briefly occupied part of the city's administration building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic's new support for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign is just the latest in a series of zigzags that have made him one of the most unpredictable figures on the Serb political stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His former allies in the opposition are now wary of him, at best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two years ago, he was one of the main leaders of the opposition. Later, he switched sides and became Mr Milosevic's deputy prime minister. During the Nato bombing campaign, Mr Draskovic's criticisms of Belgrade's dishonesty led to his &quot;half sacking&quot; from the government - though members of his party have continued to serve as ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fence-sitting has in recent weeks been his trademark. Only a few days ago, SPO members of the Belgrade city council refused even to debate a call for Mr Milosevic's resignation put forward by the other main opposition party, the Democratic Party. Mr Draskovic argued that it was &quot;not yet&quot; time for Mr Milosevic to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is unclear whether Mr Draskovic's latest intervention will transform the opposition protests into something more immediately threatening to Mr Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, there has only been nationwide smouldering, not a political blaze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The popular disillusion with politicians of all kinds is so strong that the involvement of political parties has recently proven a dampener rather than an encouragement to come out on the streets.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The largest opposition party in Serbia has urged a rival pro-democracy group to stop its dwindling street protests which have failed to unseat Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> led by Vuk Draskovic, said demonstrations for early free and fair elections in Serbia - a demand supported by all opposition parties in the country - might be organised instead.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It remains unclear, however, whether even a united opposition call for demonstrations could attract many Serbs to the streets to defy Milosevic's powerful police, which have used violence against the protesters more than once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition supporters have been disappointed in their leaders' bickering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After nearly two-months, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> street protests led by the Alliance for Change have collapsed, as only few hundred people appear for the daily marches and rallies. The group has nevertheless refused to cancel them, saying they keep the pressure on Milosevic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition leaders in Yugoslavia last night called on Serbian refugees from Kosovo to lead a march on President Milosevic's home in Belgrade on August 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plans for the march were revealed at a huge protest rally in Belgrade attended by well over 100,000 people from across Serbia. Mr Milosevic was also given until September 21 to agree to a transitional government or face popular insurrection on the streets. The deadline was set by Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic Party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last night's gathering marked a crucial turning point in the wave of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests that have swept the country since the end of the Nato bombing campaign in June. Many in towns outside Belgrade had dwindled to almost nothing and Mr Milosevic had been counting on a low turnout last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vuk Draskovic, the other main opposition leader in Yugoslavia, was booed and jeered to taunts of &quot;betrayal&quot; after he unexpectedly decided to speak to the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had announced earlier this week that he would not take part in the rally after days of squabbling with Mr Djindjic about how to remove Mr Milosevic from power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In unprecedented scenes, the crowd drowned out Mr Draskovic's attempts to speak after he had leapt on to the rostrum and taken the microphone. The jeers indicated that the crowd now sees Mr Draskovic as a covert Milosevic ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Teargas was thrown by unknown protagonists just after the opening of the rally. But although some protesters dispersed, the massive rally continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is where new Serbia is being born,&quot; Mr Djindjic told the crowd. &quot;Our proposal is to give (Mr Milosevic) a few days to make up his mind. If he does not accept a transitional government the whole of Serbia will go on the streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vladan Batic, a founder of the umbrella Alliance for Change, then announced the plan for the march on Mr Milosevic's home in the leafy, up-market Dedinje area of Belgrade. &quot;I call on our brothers from Kosovo to lead a march on Dedinje in ten days' time,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition leaders also said that signatures calling for the installation of a transitional government would be collected at the Serbian Orthodox church patriarchate in Belgrade in the run-up to the September deadline.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, the leader of Serbia's largest opposition party, said today that he will not appear at a major rally scheduled here Thursday to demand the resignation of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Planning for the demonstration, seen as a test of opposition strength, has been plagued by disarray in the ranks of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> forces, as well as by intensified counterattacks by the government. Draskovic's refusal to participate was the latest sign of internal squabbling that has raised questions about whether anyone can provide an alternative to Milosevic and channel the popular discontent that has surfaced over the past few weeks across Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;August 19th will show whether Serbs prefer to lick ice cream or change the regime,&quot; said Darko Brocic, a pollster here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic said he will send another leader of his Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the rally. The official explanation for this from the man whose fiery oratory earned him the title &quot;czar of the streets&quot; was that his replacement, Spasoje Krunic, is a better public speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other opposition figures said that Draskovic dropped out because a rival coalition of small opposition parties, the Alliance for Change, insisted on naming Velimir Ilic, mayor of the central Serbian city of Cacak, as one of its speakers. Ilic split with Draskovic a few years ago and formed his own party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Ilic also did not seem enthusiastic about the rally. He said it was &quot;organized too soon&quot; and was likely to be &quot;yet another wasting of the people's energy.&quot; At the same time, he likened Draskovic to &quot;a spoiled baby&quot; and said that &quot;until someone deprives Draskovic of a microphone, there will be no democratic changes in Serbia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally is being organized by the Group of 17, an association of independent economists. Their platform calls for Milosevic's resignation; for a transitional government run by people currently outside the political system; and for national elections within six months. Organizers said the demonstration will set a deadline for Milosevic's resignation and call for escalating protests if he refuses. In a formal notification to Belgrade police, they said they expect more than 100,000 people to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus far, the struggle between Milosevic and the opposition has been mainly a war of words, with each side accusing the other of being &quot;terrorists&quot; and seeking to foment civil war. Milosevic supporters also have accused the opposition of acting as surrogates for NATO, which waged a 78-day bombing campaign against Yugoslavia this spring, and of organizing the demonstration in honor of President Clinton's birthday, which falls on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic called the Alliance for Change &quot;a terrorist organization&quot; after one of its leaders, Vesna Pesic, told a crowd that the &quot;Romanian scenario&quot; would be used to get rid of Milosevic if necessary--a reference to the execution of Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife following the 1989 uprising there.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT BEGAN as an act of defiance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in 2000, three students decided to hold a music festival in the northern Serbian city of Novi Sad. It was a year after Nato forces had bombed the city and a few months before that year's presidential election. The organisers decided it was time to make a protest about the political situation, so they booked some bands.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To avoid drawing undue attention from the authorities, that inaugural EXIT gathering was not billed as an anti-Slobodan Milosevic protest, but the intent was clear to all. A festival with a slogan of &quot;EXIT out of 10 years of madness&quot; was never just going to be about hedonism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the course of three months, a huge number of bands and performers played on various stages in the city, while audiences were encouraged by activists from the Otpor youth </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to think about how the political system could be used to end the Milosevic era. The September election was the first step in that process, and EXIT went on to become an annual gathering for Serbian youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's still sedition of a kind in the air at EXIT. &quot;Rebellion is the only thing that keeps you alive,&quot; proclaims a festival-site poster. The poster, however, is not calling for the removal of an unpopular politician; rather, it is advertising a brand of footwear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such branding is just one sign of how much has changed around these parts. Car manufacturers, beer brands and telecom companies were not around for the first EXIT, but they're making up for lost time now by seeking to attach their logos to every available space.After all, this is where their target audience are. The numbers in attendance are testament to EXIT's position as one of the biggest festivals in Europe. This year, more than 50,000 people came through the gates every night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least half of the audience came from overseas, with research last year indicating that there were 52 different nationalities present. Organisers estimate at least 8,000 travelled from Britain this year and say there were about 500 advance weekend ticket sales from Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These visitors are usually jaded by the same old festival fare on offer at home and are keen to experience something completely different abroad. The trick for EXIT in the coming years will be to continue to appeal to them, while also ensuring that the increasing corporate buy-in doesn't change the festival. The local economy is also a significant stakeholder in the event. Besides the annual financial boost for local pockets, festival tourism means longer-term gains as fans go away with positive impressions of Serbia and spread the word. And it's hard not to be impressed by what's on offer in Novi Sad because EXIT really is a festival with lots of the wow factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a start, there's the venue, a true star in the proceedings. The magnificent medieval Petrovaradin fortress overlooks the Danube, and the city and is easily one of the most striking festival sites in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fortress provided a strategic stronghold against Turkish and Austrian invaders throughout its history, but few of them can have been as raucous or as good-natured as the EXITgoers who take it over four nights every July. There are about two dozen stages located in every nook and cranny of the site. You simply follow the hordes as they climb up steps onto walls or walk through tunnels to get from stage to stage. Just when you think you've got to every single stage on the site, you find another one situated where you least expect it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever about the two main stages where the bigger acts perform, it's the smaller stages which provide the most surprises. These cater for all musical tastes, from Latin, reggae and indie rock to happy hardcore, live electronica, cheesy trance and a couple of dozen metal/punk bands making the fiercest, angriest racket imaginable. In their midst, you'll find exciting bands such as Vrelo, Orkestra del Sol and the Pannonia All Stars doing their thing. It's not all music, though. In keeping with EXIT's political roots, there are dozens of stalls vociferously advocating an assortment of causes. You'll be handed anti-vivisection and anti-trafficking leaflets, along with more on vegetarianism, gay rights, women's refuges, recycling, why Serbia needs to be in the EU and the importance of keeping Novi Sad a Nazi-free zone. There is also someone attempting to promote the benefits of yoga, but there are few takers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the bulk of the acts and DJs on the smaller stages may not be household names beyond the Balkans, EXIT does still draw the big names. This year, Manu Chao caused road-blocks around the main stage when he and his band performed last Saturday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others who rose to the occasion included The Gossip (whose new material sounds fantastic), the excellent Gogol Bordello (a sort of homecoming for the New York gypsy punk band), Ministry (the industrial metal band playing one of their final shows ever), The Hives and a rejuvenated Paul Weller, complete with a blistering make-over for Eton Rifles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some, though, did not fare quite so well. Pharrell Williams from NERD had sound issues which led him to petulantly fling his microphone at some poor, unfortunate roadie. Both Primal Scream and The Streets also failed to sizzle or connect with the audience, while Roni Size and Reprazent seemed a tad lost on that big stage. Festival headliners the Sex Pistols may have drawn a big crowd, but a muddy sound and pretty tired renditions of the classics meant people began to stream away from the stage after about three songs. Over on the dance stage, it was Audion's subtle, sexy, tweaked house, Francois K's masterclass in mood-setting, the sleazy electro of Claude VonStroke, a live set from Booka Shade and an epic set from Swedish house producer Axwell which took all the plaudits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the thousands left the site in the early hours of Monday morning, the last thing they saw was a reminder about next year. In July 2009, EXIT will celebrate its 10th anniversary. That really should be the greatest rock'n'rave weekend of the year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least half of the audience came from overseas, with research last year indicating that there were 52 different nationalities present. Organisers estimate at least 8,000 travelled from Britain this year and say there were about 500 advance weekend ticket sales from Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These visitors are usually jaded by the same old festival fare on offer at home and are keen to experience something completely different abroad. The trick for EXIT in the coming years will be to continue to appeal to them, while also ensuring that the increasing corporate buy-in doesn't change the festival. The local economy is also a significant stakeholder in the event. Besides the annual financial boost for local pockets, festival tourism means longer-term gains as fans go away with positive impressions of Serbia and spread the word. And it's hard not to be impressed by what's on offer in Novi Sad because EXIT really is a festival with lots of the wow factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a start, there's the venue, a true star in the proceedings. The magnificent medieval Petrovaradin fortress overlooks the Danube, and the city and is easily one of the most striking festival sites in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fortress provided a strategic stronghold against Turkish and Austrian invaders throughout its history, but few of them can have been as raucous or as good-natured as the EXITgoers who take it over four nights every July. There are about two dozen stages located in every nook and cranny of the site. You simply follow the hordes as they climb up steps onto walls or walk through tunnels to get from stage to stage. Just when you think you've got to every single stage on the site, you find another one situated where you least expect it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever about the two main stages where the bigger acts perform, it's the smaller stages which provide the most surprises. These cater for all musical tastes, from Latin, reggae and indie rock to happy hardcore, live electronica, cheesy trance and a couple of dozen metal/punk bands making the fiercest, angriest racket imaginable. In their midst, you'll find exciting bands such as Vrelo, Orkestra del Sol and the Pannonia All Stars doing their thing. It's not all music, though. In keeping with EXIT's political roots, there are dozens of stalls vociferously advocating an assortment of causes. You'll be handed anti-vivisection and anti-trafficking leaflets, along with more on vegetarianism, gay rights, women's refuges, recycling, why Serbia needs to be in the EU and the importance of keeping Novi Sad a Nazi-free zone. There is also someone attempting to promote the benefits of yoga, but there are few takers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the bulk of the acts and DJs on the smaller stages may not be household names beyond the Balkans, EXIT does still draw the big names. This year, Manu Chao caused road-blocks around the main stage when he and his band performed last Saturday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others who rose to the occasion included The Gossip (whose new material sounds fantastic), the excellent Gogol Bordello (a sort of homecoming for the New York gypsy punk band), Ministry (the industrial metal band playing one of their final shows ever), The Hives and a rejuvenated Paul Weller, complete with a blistering make-over for Eton Rifles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some, though, did not fare quite so well. Pharrell Williams from NERD had sound issues which led him to petulantly fling his microphone at some poor, unfortunate roadie. Both Primal Scream and The Streets also failed to sizzle or connect with the audience, while Roni Size and Reprazent seemed a tad lost on that big stage. Festival headliners the Sex Pistols may have drawn a big crowd, but a muddy sound and pretty tired renditions of the classics meant people began to stream away from the stage after about three songs. Over on the dance stage, it was Audion's subtle, sexy, tweaked house, Francois K's masterclass in mood-setting, the sleazy electro of Claude VonStroke, a live set from Booka Shade and an epic set from Swedish house producer Axwell which took all the plaudits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the thousands left the site in the early hours of Monday morning, the last thing they saw was a reminder about next year. In July 2009, EXIT will celebrate its 10th anniversary. That really should be the greatest rock'n'rave weekend of the year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by Sri Lankan-based Maldivian Minivan News website on 12 September</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two foreign nationals were asked to leave the Maldives at the weekend, after officials accused them of &quot;undermining the national unity&quot; of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the men, an American and a Serbian, told Minivan News that they were simply on holiday in the Maldives and dismissed government allegations of wrongdoing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said that they had been &quot;politely asked&quot; to leave the Maldives by the authorities but stressed that they had not broken any laws and were not charged with any offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men - both experts in non-violent resistance techniques - had been visiting Addu Atoll. They said that whilst on holiday they had &quot;exchanged ideas&quot; with opposition activists about how to conduct peaceful protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am from a country which was in a similar situation to the Maldives,&quot; said the Serbian man, who asked not to be named. &quot;I wasn't a member of OTPOR [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">], but I did work closely with them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All over the world people are trying to figure out how to change their societies peacefully and without conflict... [ellipsis as published] and that can be a difficult thing to do,&quot; added the American man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In most countries - India, Nepal, Sri Lanka - it's normal for citizens to talk about the problems they face. But in some countries you are not allowed to talk about your problems. So these people need to learn how to work in an atmosphere of fear and how to bring that fear down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you can reduce fear on both side, then people can come to an agreement,&quot; the American said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controller of Immigration and prominent DRP [ruling party] Majlis [parliament] member Ibrahim Shafiu told Haveeru [Daily] that the decision to ask the men to leave was taken because he had received reports alleging that the men had been briefing a gathering of youngsters in Addu on ''how to face the security forces and continue the recent acts of violence in the atoll''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We questioned them after bringing them to Immigrations,&quot; Shafiu said. &quot;They agreed that they had met groups of young people and given them such information. A condition for granting a tourist visa is that they could be expelled from the country if they did, or were suspected of doing, anything to undermine national and religious unity in the Maldives,'' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shafiu claimed that the men would not be subject to a full investigation &quot;so as not to waste time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the American denied the allegations: &quot;We never did anything to bring instability into the country. We didn't break any laws. We are not members of OTPOR. We were not deported. We just exchanged ideas with people. A government official explained to us that Maldives is 'a democracy'. Yet, after that meeting we were constantly photographed and then we were politely asked to leave. The government said they were worried we were undermining the stability of the country but they didn't explain how.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation in the Maldives is very similar to the situation in Serbia before the fall of Milosevic,&quot; said the Serb. &quot;We were not advising the people of Addu of anything. But we did exchange ideas with them. I spoke about Serbia, and how we managed to change things through non-violent means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serb added: &quot;I said: we wouldn't have referred to the police as 'Golhaa Force' [&quot;Golhaabo&quot; is a nickname for President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom] because the police are not the guilty ones. They are just doing their job. In Serbia, we did not go after our countrymen, our neighbours or our brothers. Instead, we talked to the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Serbia, we never threw rocks at the police. It would have been the wrong thing to do. It's very important not to do that. Why, people may ask: 1) Because you'll lose - the police have all the weapons and training to fight violently; 2) It causes an increase in fear on both sides and makes a solution more difficult; and 3) the general public will not hear your political message, instead they'll just see the violence,&quot; the Serb continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If one puts themselves in the position of the police, and you see a crowd running towards you throwing stones, you are likely to respond with violence,&quot; added the American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Serbia, by acting peacefully we changed the behaviour of the police. The police realized that the people didn't want to fight with them - they only wanted things to change. The Serbian police were a very, very aggressive security force but they changed,&quot; said the Serb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Maldives we saw that the people in the opposition had the energy and foresight to use non-violent methods. They are very patriotic and very proud of their country,&quot; said the American.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFTER THURSDAY'S massive protest rally against Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's opposition leaders are under stronger pressure than ever to set aside their differences and topple the Yugoslav President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Belgrade march, which attracted as many as 150,000 people from every section of the opposition, demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the size of the hostility to Mr Milosevic and the jealous rivalries of his opponents, which may yet keep him in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, the government- controlled press did its best to play down the event, relegating coverage to the inside pages, with headlines such as that in the newspaper Politika, which proclaimed a &quot;failed pro-Nato rally&quot; attended by no more than 25,000 demonstrators.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One can't tell who is more disappointed, the organisers, the participants or the Nato bosses and mentors,&quot; said the state television station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the government's anti-Nato card seems to be losing some of its potency, and the main leaders of the rally were delighted with the turnout at the largest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protest since 1997. They stepped up their demands for his speedy and unconditional resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the splits in the opposition are starting to show. While Zoran Djindjic demanded Mr Milosevic's immediate replacement, his bitter rival, the quixotic Vuk Draskovic, urged early elections as the best way out of the deadlock. But the former deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia was widely booed for his pains. &quot;Treason, Treason,&quot; chanted sections of the crowd, mindful of Mr Draskovic's long history of zigzagging between the opposition and Mr Milosevic, and fearful that any election would be simply rigged by the present regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile Nato governments are becoming daily more impatient at the squabbling. Yesterday it was the turn of Joschka Fischer, the German Foreign Minister, to warn that the Serb opposition must unite. &quot;All the democratic forces in Serbia must continue down the path they've started,&quot; he said. &quot;The door to Europe is open for a democratic Serbia.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A TOP Serbian opposition leader facing military trial for draft dodging has warned that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to oust President Slobodan Milosevic would accelerate if he were convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zoran Djindjic also appealed to Yugoslav army commanders to abandon their pledges to protect the Yugoslav President and try to oust him, saying the country's very survival is threatened.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Djindjic, who is leading popular protests against Mr Milosevic, was due to be summoned to appear before a Belgrade military court yesterday for pre-trial investigation, his lawyers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The allegations that he avoided compulsory army service during the NATO air campaign carry a maximum sentence of 20 years' jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Djindjic's Alliance for Change coalition has been staging regular </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies for the past month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The protests reflect growing Serb discontent with Mr Milosevic's policies, which many blame for a destroyed economy, international isolation, NATO's bombing campaign and the de facto loss of Kosovo province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 46-year-old politician fled Serbia during the air campaign fearing his life was in danger. His lawyers say he never received a call-up notice. Nearly 30,000 other men face similar draft-dodging charges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With their websites and stickers, their pranks and slogans aimed at banishing widespread fear of a corrupt regime, the democracy guerrillas of the Ukrainian Pora youth </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have already notched up a famous victory - whatever the outcome of the dangerous stand-off in Kiev.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ukraine, traditionally passive in its politics, has been mobilised by the young democracy activists and will never be the same again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But while the gains of the orange-bedecked &quot;chestnut revolution&quot; are Ukraine's, the campaign is an American creation, a sophisticated and brilliantly conceived exercise in western branding and mass marketing that, in four countries in four years, has been used to try to salvage rigged elections and topple unsavoury regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Funded and organised by the US government, deploying US consultancies, pollsters, diplomats, the two big American parties and US non-government organisations, the campaign was first used in Europe in Belgrade in 2000 to beat Slobodan Milosevic at the ballot box.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richard Miles, the US ambassador in Belgrade, played a key role. And by last year, as US ambassador in Tbilisi, he repeated the trick in Georgia, coaching Mikhail Saakashvili in how to bring down Eduard Shevardnadze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ten months after the success in Belgrade, the US ambassador in Minsk, Michael Kozak, a veteran of similar operations in central America, notably in Nicaragua, organised a near identical campaign to try to defeat the Belarus hardman, Alexander Lukashenko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That one failed. &quot;There will be no Kostunica in Belarus,&quot; the Belarus president declared, referring to the victory in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But experience gained in Serbia, Georgia and Belarus has been invaluable in plotting to beat the regime of Leonid Kuchma in Kiev.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The operation - engineering democracy through the ballot box and civil disobedience - is now so slick that the methods have matured into a template for winning other people's elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the centre of Belgrade, there is a dingy office staffed by computer-literate youngsters who call themselves the Centre for Non-violent Resistance. If you want to know how to beat a regime that controls the mass media, the judges, the courts, the security apparatus and the voting stations, the young Belgrade activists are for hire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They emerged from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor, meaning resistance. The catchy, single- word branding is important. In Georgia last year, the parallel student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was Khmara. In Belarus, it was Zubr. In Ukraine, it is Pora, meaning high time. Otpor also had a potent, simple slogan that appeared everywhere in Serbia in 2000 - the two words &quot; gotov je&quot;, meaning &quot;he's finished&quot;, a reference to Milosevic. A logo of a black-and-white clenched fist completed the masterful marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Ukraine, the equivalent is a ticking clock, also signalling that the Kuchma regime's days are numbered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stickers, spray paint and websites are the young activists' weapons. Irony and street comedy mocking the regime have been hugely successful in puncturing public fear and enraging the powerful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, before becoming president in Georgia, the US-educated Mr Saakashvili travelled from Tbilisi to Belgrade to be coached in the techniques of mass defiance. In Belarus, the US embassy organised the dispatch of young opposition leaders to the Baltic, where they met up with Serbs travelling from Belgrade. In Serbia's case, given the hostile environment in Belgrade, the Americans organised the overthrow from neighbouring Hungary - Budapest and Szeged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent weeks, several Serbs travelled to the Ukraine. Indeed, one of the leaders from Belgrade, Aleksandar Maric, was turned away at the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democratic party's National Democratic Institute, the Republican party's International Republican Institute, the US state department and USAid are the main agencies involved in these grassroots campaigns as well as the Freedom House NGO and billionaire George Soros's open society institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US pollsters and professional consultants are hired to organise focus groups and use psephological data to plot strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The usually fractious oppositions have to be united behind a single candidate if there is to be any chance of unseating the regime. That leader is selected on pragmatic and objective grounds, even if he or she is anti-American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Serbia, US pollsters Penn, Schoen and Berland Associates discovered that the assassinated pro-western opposition leader, Zoran Djindjic, was reviled at home and had no chance of beating Milosevic fairly in an election. He was persuaded to take a back seat to the anti-western Vojislav Kostunica, who is now Serbian prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Belarus, US officials ordered opposition parties to unite behind the dour, elderly trade unionist, Vladimir Goncharik, because he appealed to much of the Lukashenko constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officially, the US government spent $ 41m (&pound;21.7m) organising and funding the year-long operation to get rid of Milosevic from October 1999. In Ukraine, the figure is said to be around $ 14m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from the student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the united opposition, the other key element in the democracy template is what is known as the &quot;parallel vote tabulation&quot;, a counter to the election-rigging tricks beloved of disreputable regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are professional outside election monitors from bodies such as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, but the Ukrainian poll, like its predecessors, also featured thousands of local election monitors trained and paid by western groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Freedom House and the Democratic party's NDI helped fund and organise the &quot;largest civil regional election monitoring effort&quot; in Ukraine, involving more than 1,000 trained observers. They also organised exit polls. On Sunday night those polls gave Mr Yushchenko an 11-point lead and set the agenda for much of what has followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exit polls are seen as critical because they seize the initiative in the propaganda battle with the regime, invariably appearing first, receiving wide media coverage and putting the onus on the authorities to respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final stage in the US template concerns how to react when the incumbent tries to steal a lost election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Belarus, President Lukashenko won, so the response was minimal. In Belgrade, Tbilisi, and now Kiev, where the authorities initially tried to cling to power, the advice was to stay cool but determined and to organise mass displays of civil disobedience, which must remain peaceful but risk provoking the regime into violent suppression.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Serbia, Sept. 20</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leader of a group of opposition parties that will try to bring down President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia in a series of rallies and demonstrations beginning on Tuesday says the outcome is really up to the Serbian people now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is poker with all the cards on the table,&quot; the leader, Zoran Djindjic, said in an interview today. &quot;We don't have any choice. We have to try to remove Milosevic by the end of the year, and do it with people on the streets. We believe that the people are stronger than Milosevic. But it depends on the people of Serbia now, and I don't know what their reaction will be.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Djindjic's Democratic Party and the smaller opposition parties in the Alliance for Change have made plans for simultaneous rallies beginning on Tuesday evening in 32 Serbian cities and towns. They have also tried to organize daytime events. Party workers will hand out material from kiosks and canvass local citizens with petitions. Daily mock trials of Government officials will be presented on accusations of having failed the people or of being corrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been a summer of intermittent rallies and disputes within the broader opposition. The largest of the parties, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Vuk Draskovic, will not take part in the new demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Alliance politicians said it was time, as Mr. Djindjic (pronounced JIN-jitch) said last month, at the biggest opposition rally to date, &quot;to go to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally on Tuesday in Belgrade, the capital, will be in the Square of the Republic, which will look full with 10,000 to 15,000 people, not in front of the Parliament, where the rally last month drew an estimated 100,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rally posters show Mr. Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic, with big red X's over their faces and with the slogan, &quot;The people choose.&quot; That is an echo of a 1945 slogan that said, &quot;We want no king, we want Tito -- the people choose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic, appearing to use the time-honored tactic of lowering expectations, said he expected that the rallies would start slowly and peak.  Depending on the turnout, by the beginning of next month the Alliance plans to concentrate on activities like traffic blockades, some form of a general strike and announcing an alternative shadow Government, to be led by a former Central Bank governor, Dragoslav Avramovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition-run local governments of the main cities may then make declarations of no confidence in the Government and refuse to obey it, Mr. Djindjic suggested. Or the opposition could on its own hold informal elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But by the end of October, Milosevic will respond in some way,&quot; Mr. Djindjic said, &quot;with violence or counterdemonstrations or new elections or his resignation,&quot; although Mr. Djindjic said he had no great hopes for an easy or quick resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic, the other main opposition leader, has been pushing for early elections, and he is widely expected to wait to see how the rallies fare before committing himself. If the turnouts are large, he will have little choice but to join in some fashion. If they are small, he is most likely to declare himself the leader of the opposition and urge the others to unite behind him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, Mr. Draskovic said that he would join protests if the opposition could agree on conditions for free, fair and early elections and if Mr. Milosevic refused to schedule them. But it is not clear that Mr. Milosevic feels the need to have early elections, in view of their risks to him, and he is also waiting to see what turnouts the Alliance produces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So is the United States, which is backing Mr. Djindjic's efforts -- with more moral support than tangible help. A senior Administration official said in a telephone interview: &quot;We'll see if these demonstrations go well, if they have a progression, plateau or even decline. Then they can decide what comes next. They have four or five weeks to mobilize people and see where that takes them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is a decline, he said, &quot;then the Administration may have to change its tune&quot; and accept early elections with Mr. Milosevic still in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic and Alliance officials are encouraged by opinion polls that indicate that two-thirds of Serbs are unhappy with the Government, half believe that the political system is growing worse, and nearly 40 percent have no confidence in Mr. Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the polls, released last week by the Center for Studying Alternatives, a research institute, indicate deep and abiding insecurity and fear of chaos and civil war. The Government is exploiting such fears through its propaganda, accusing the Alliance of acting as NATO's cat's paw, of being in the pay of the United States and trying to finish what the bombing started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 90 percent of the respondents in a random sample of 1,600 Serbs said they feared a lowering of their already poor living standards. Nearly as many said they feared new inflation and unemployment. Eighty percent said they feared civil war, and 70 percent mentioned hunger. When asked whether they favored change even at the price of violence, many respondents demanded that the word violence be scratched out, pollsters said. Still, about a third said they wanted change at any price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point of the demonstrations is to turn those concerns into collective action, to mobilize Serbs who fear for their future and to give them confidence, Mr. Djindjic said. If the rallies build and the Alliance can achieve as many as two million signatures on petitions, he added, he expects the Government to begin to crumble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic said 30 people associated with the Government and its business interests had approached his party about making contributions as a sort of bet on the future. They also want help in having their names removed from a European Union ban on visas and travel for 300 notables from the present administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior aide to Mr. Djindjic, Cedomir Jovanovic, said today, &quot;Milosevic's power will disappear the day he no longer controls the levers of power, when the police understand that there's no one behind their backs but a little group of thieves, and in front of them are the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some party officials are also concerned that they are attempting too much and opening too many fronts, that they have to deal with the conflict with Mr. Draskovic, as well as internal conflicts about strategy in the party and the Alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party's 5,000 active participants are already working 12 hours a day, officials said, and the canvassing that Mr. Djindjic plans will take even more out of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, it is party-building work -- obtaining signatures and telephone numbers -- of the kind that the opposition has rarely done, and it should help in elections should they come about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for himself, Mr. Djindjic stepped back from an earlier pledge to quit as party leader if Mr. Milosevic was still in power on Jan. 1, 2000. But if this new effort to unseat Mr. Milosevic fails, Mr. Djindjic said, he will step down as a &quot;lightning rod&quot; for criticism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Serb opposition leader accused of evading conscription during the NATO air campaign warned Tuesday that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to oust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic would accelerate if he is convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoran Djindjic appealed to army commanders to abandon their pledges to protect Milosevic and try to oust him, saying the country's survival is threatened.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic, who is leading popular protests against Milosevic, has been summoned to appear before a Belgrade military court today for pretrial investigation, his lawyers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations that he avoided compulsory army service during the NATO bombing could lead to convictions that carry a maximum sentence of 20 years. If he is convicted and imprisoned, ''it would be a very wrong decision . . . which would accelerate and radicalize the protests,'' Djindjic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic's Alliance for Change coalition has been holding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies for the past month. The protests reflect growing Serb discontentment with Milosevic's policies, which many blame for a destroyed economy, the NATO bombing and the de facto loss of Kosovo. Djindjic, 46, called the allegations part of an attempt by Milosevic to divert public anger by painting opposition leaders as traitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He fled Serbia to the more liberal Yugoslav republic of Montenegro during the air campaign, which began March 24. He said his life was threatened because of his opposition to Milosevic. His lawyers said he never received a notice of conscription. Nearly 30,000 others face similar charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BELGRADE: Serbian opposition leaders conscripted pots, pans, drums and foghorns into their latest protest in a switch of tactics designed to keep the pressure on authorities in Belgrade to accept their wins in local elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tactic was aimed chiefly at protesting against the pro-government coverage of the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> churned out by Serbia's State-run media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After 44 straight days of street protests, culminating in a giant New Year's Eve party in Belgrade that brought out 200,000 people, opposition supporters were told instead to stay at home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This time they were asked to create a racket, specifically to use pots and pans and anything metal they could lay their hands on to drown out the main evening news program on State television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But 10,000 students, who have marched in the vanguard of the six-week </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests, took to the streets of the capital anyway late on Wednesday, defying bitter cold as well as a ban on demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were soon joined by thousands more citizens, but riot police -out in force last week -could not be seen on the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier that day the speaker of Montenegro's parliament, Mr Marovic, called on Belgrade to respect the findings of a team of international mediators from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, who have called on the Serbian President, Mr Milosevic, to recognise the results of the November 17 municipal elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Belgrade is expected to give its response by today to the OSCE team, which has urged it to accept the gains made by the opposition Together coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition candidates won 13 of Serbia's biggest towns and nine districts in Belgrade, but the results were cancelled by authorities, triggering the huge daily street protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Marovic said acknowledgement of the OSCE report would be &quot;a first step to overcoming the crisis in Belgrade and Serbia&quot;. Montenegro and Serbia are the republics that make up federal Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Marovic said federal Yugoslavia &quot;must not face renewed isolation . . . democracy is the path to follow to reintegrate it into the international community&quot;. In a short televised new year message, Mr Milosevic spoke briefly of the country's &quot;external and internal difficulties&quot; but did not refer directly to the protests. He promised 1997 would be a &quot;year of reform&quot;. AFP&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GEORGIA'S PARLIAMENT set 4 January as the date for new presidential elections yesterday, after the bloodless &quot;rose revolution&quot; that saw President Eduard Shevardnadze's departure at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The election date was agreed after Georgia's highest court invalidated the elections which saw the ruling party try to hold on to power by brazenly stuffing ballot boxes and changing voter lists in plain sight of foreign election monitors. Members of the legislature gathered in the parliament building, the epicentre of the country's recent protests, and overwhelmingly decided to press ahead with the elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We should stand side by side independent of nationalities, independent of political interests,&quot; said parliamentary speaker and interim President Nino Budrzhanadze. &quot;Today we are starting a new era.&quot; A vase of red roses stood on the speaker's lectern, a reminder of the flowers many of the protesters carried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the parliament convened, Mikhail Saakashvili, another opposition leader and the expected successor to Mr Shevardnadze, warned of the risk of civil war if the new elections do not proceed as planned. &quot;If this session doesn't set new elections, Georgia will find itself in a state of civil war,&quot; the American-educated former justice minister said in a televised statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Saakashvili has warned that there remains a potential for violence. Concern is growing that Adzharia, an autonomous province in southwestern Georgia on the Black Sea led by his opponent, Aslan Abashidze may now seek independence from Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Abashidze warned yesterday that Adzharia was breaking off relations with the capital, Tbilisi, until a new president was elected. Train and air service were cut and regional security forces sealed the borders with the rest of the country. Mr Abashidze said his region would boycott the parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country's interim leaders have vowed to bring political stability to the country as quickly as possible. &quot;I'm going to do everything to maintain stability and peace in the country,&quot; Ms Burdzhanadze said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Georgia's new power brokers are following in the footsteps of the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which deposed Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, in October 2000 after a similar popular uprising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition leaders went to Belgrade to learn the lessons of their revolution and then arranged for their Serbian counterparts to travel to Tbilisi. All last summer members of Serbia's opposition organisation Otpor (Resistance) slipped into Georgia to run training courses in civil disobedience for thousands of students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Financed by the George Soros foundation, they organised the mostly student opposition under the slogan Kmara! (Enough!) which was modelled on the Serbian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> slogan &quot;You're cooked!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The US government also funded courses for the opposition parties in techniques for building independent democratic institutions in the country. As Ivane Merabishvili, general secretary of the National </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> party that led the revolt told the Washington Post's Peter Baker: &quot;All the demonstrators knew the tactics of the revolution in Belgrade by heart. Everyone knew what to do. This was a copy of that revolution, only louder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Georgia's new rulers now face a struggle to rebuild their poverty- stricken country. Political sabotage, corruption, separatist threats and an economic quagmire threaten to drag the country down. One of the first tasks will be to restore relations with the IMF, the EU and other aid donors who walked away from the country because of systemic corruption and mismanagement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two employees were badly beaten in the morning raid on the Torlak transmission station, Studio B executives said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Five assailants who were wearing police uniforms stormed the compound, tied up and beat the two workers and tore transmitter cables, causing Studio B to go off the air temporarily.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This evening, a court fined the station $40,000 in a libel suit filed by a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City Council owns the station, and it is controlled by the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of an opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kojadinovic said the station did not have the money to pay for using its frequencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kojadinovic was fined $20,000 in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police officer, Branko Djuric, was accused on a Studio B program of involvement in a vehicular accident in October in which Mr. Draskovic was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic has said the crash was an assassination attempt disguised as an accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge rejected Studio B's defense that it could not be held responsible for comments made by guests on live programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kojadinovic met tonight with major opposition leaders in Serbia, accusing President Slobodan Milosevic's government of the &quot;most brutal action&quot; in its crackdown against the station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement issued after the meeting called for an end to all pressure and threatened street protests if it continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their own statement, the police denied that they had been involved in the raid and accused Studio B of &quot;another malicious and incorrect report fabricated in that media house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pictures from the Torlak center, broadcast on the Studio B evening news, showed bloodstains on the floor of the transmission station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two workers who were attacked were taken to a hospital for treatment. One had his head bandaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kojadinovic said: &quot;The five attackers arrived in a police jeep with the siren howling. The workers believed that they came for an inspection and opened the gate, after which the beating began.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transmissions were temporarily interrupted to 400,000 viewers and one million radio listeners. Another independent outlet, B2-92 radio, which broadcasts on a Studio B frequency, was also cut off. Some equipment also was confiscated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief technician of Studio B, Dusan Markovic, said the attackers were obviously extremely skilled and able to distinguish which &quot;cables belonged to independent media.&quot; Several state-run stations also have equipment and transmitters at the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government may be trying to crack down on major independent news media ahead of local and federal elections this year. Studio B has broadcast programs that criticized Mr. Milosevic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yugoslavia's Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic is receiving a good deal of press after indicating in an interview with Studio B, the most liberal of the Belgrade TV stations, that Yugoslavia should accept an armed UN peacekeeping force in Kosovo once the bombing stops. This is the first time that any member of the Yugoslav government has made such a statement, at least in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic is probably the best-recognized if not the best-known Serb outside of Yugoslavia, except for President Slobodan Milosevic. Mention to anyone the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protest marches of 1996 in downtown Belgrade and the image of a tall, athletically built, bearded marcher in the front ranks comes to mind.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That person was -- and is -- Vuk Draskovic. He has been the president of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the major opposition party in Serbia, since 1990. Like so many politicians in the Balkans that buck the system, he has been imprisoned numerous times since 1991 due to his anti-war and anti-regime activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in 1946, he graduated as a lawyer in 1968. He is the author of several novels and for a period was a journalist for the Tanjug press agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk, as he likes to be called, has a strong following, particularly in Belgrade, and as a result President Milosevic opted to appoint him deputy prime minister instead of leaving him in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Realistically, he has little influence in the decision-making process; however, he can generate a good deal of media attention with his views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had two long meetings with Mr. Draskovic while I was in Belgrade three weeks ago. On camera, of course, he was keeping to the party line. But off the record, Mr. Draskovic is refreshingly honest and objective. Quite frankly, he probably is not cut out to be a politician and has been thrust into the fray by circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To my surprise, we agreed about almost everything that has to be done to bring the war to a conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A ceasefire is essential before any political negotiations take place. A temporary, fixed-time ceasefire would be acceptable. Confidence-building measures should be implemented immediately. Reconciliation protocol would be developed by the international community and refugees would return to Kosovo. Yugoslavia would welcome Partners for Peace status within NATO, as was discussed at Rambouillet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone within Yugoslavia, including Serbs and Kosovo Albanians, suspected of committing war crimes should be charged and tried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the key issue of an international force in Kosovo, Mr. Draskovic agreed that the best solution is a UN-led mission made up of troops from countries outside the conflict. He actually went one step further and suggested that Kosovo be declared a UN protectorate for a period of perhaps three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic is accepting considerable risk with his statements of the past 24 hours. He is no fool and might well be of the opinion that his security is somewhat guaranteed by his popular following.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he were to be murdered, as an outspoken Belgrade newspaper editor was just more than one month ago, it could well spark a popular uprising in Belgrade. The West has to be careful not to cosy up too obviously to Mr. Draskovic as that would only alienate him even more from Mr. Milosevic. And that's not a comfortable position for anyone in the middle of a war where the rules for internal security are, to put it mildly, a bit loose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The arrest of Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade yesterday on charges of corruption and abuse of office is welcome indeed as a confirmation that the young Serbian democracy is coming to terms with the recent disastrous past of its country. Milosevic's party and collaborators in the military and security forces turned the last decade into a cauldron of oppression and war for the nations of ex-Yugoslavia and surrounding states, simultaneously enriching themselves. His arrest on these charges should be recognised by the international community which has put such pressure on Serbia to come to terms with Milosevic as a first step on the road to making him account for his crimes against humanity at the war crimes tribunals in The Hague.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's decision to turn Yugoslavia's disintegration to his political advantage by asserting Serb nationalism against its former constituent nations enabled him to mobilise its surviving security apparatus and enrich himself in the process. These latter crimes are the one with which the new Serbian government is now coming to terms. Their painful realisation of how much damage they had sustained and time lost has been brought home by normalising relations with the rest of the world since last autumn's dramatic events which removed Milosevic from power. They have simultaneously had to come to terms with international pressure to bring Milosevic and others charged with war crimes at The Hague to justice in that city. Inevitably such pressure has been controversial within the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new president of what remains of the Yugoslav federation, Mr Vojislav Kostunica, has opposed the efforts to bring Milosevic before The Hague tribunal on grounds of his State's law and sovereignty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Younger members of the government are more willing to contemplate that possibility after he has faced trial for corruption in Belgrade. He should be tried on both counts. But the timing of that outcome will depend on how the evolution of Serbian democracy is orchestrated with international pressure to bring Milosevic to The Hague, for example by denying it aid for reconstruction. Yesterday's positive reaction from American and European leaders appears to take account of these realities. It is to be hoped there will not be premature action to force the Serb government to go further than they are politically capable of doing, despite the pressing need to validate the trial process in The Hague. Milosevic's first and last opportunist resort to Serb nationalism occurred in Kosovo. The fallout from that crisis is still with us there and in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, for the last two weeks have tested the European Union's new crisis management apparatus to its limits. On balance it has succeeded in finding a war to support the Macedonian government's military campaign against Albanian rebels in the Tetovo region and maintain pressure on them to organise a political dialogue on minority rights capable of forestalling the rebels' appeal while keeping the moderate Albanian parties in the coalition. That tentative success is a great relief to surrounding states and the wider Europe of which the Balkans must increasingly be recognised as a constituent part. This achievement very much remains to be consolidated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kosovo crisis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HOW many times does it need to be said? This war is mad and should be stopped. Violence is escalating in Kosovo and Serbia. Back home we are fed Orwellian propaganda. Remember the 1984 Newsspeak slogan: War is Peace?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djorde e-mailed from Nis in Serbia: &quot;I counted 18 explosions in the city. Help, this is past normal reasoning! People are mad with fear. Please, send this message somewhere! Help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If I was in charge now, I'd stop the bombing and indict Milosevic, Clinton and Blair as war criminals. All three count as deranged abusers in my books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are complex reasons for war - but we are only getting the heart- squeeze version. Rather than scenes of carnage, we are shown pictures of Blair looking sorrowfully at an Albanian refugee. It doesn't make sense. If the West really cares, why didn't we support </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> democratic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why are we spending billions on murdering innocent civilians and giving less than one percent for refugee relief? But we only get the Biggles version: Milosevic is a Hitler. Please don't dilute the significance of the Second World War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Milosevic is committing genocide then genocide is happening all over the world. There are at least 140 armed conflicts in the globe with catastrophic numbers of refugees fleeing for their lives. The world is in crisis and it's time to look for new solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Might is Right is an outmoded, crude and brutal way to deal with conflict. It stems from the primitive belief that there are only two positions: top-dog or under-dog, powerful or powerless. Come on, use your imagination! There is another way. Forget that hoary old idea that you don't reward a bully. Prison research shows that educational and work opportunities work best in keeping bullies out of trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wouldn't it have been better to take up Milosevic's pre-war offer of Kosovan autonomy and send in tons of aid and international human rights workers? All conflict stems from scarcity of resources, be it battlezone, workplace or home. If you think someone is getting more than you, you want to claw it back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact is there is enough to go round - if only we could use our rational faculties to share it out more fairly. Isn't it better to reform the unequal political and economic situation that produces scarcity, rather than wait until it gets to the point of war?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WATCH out for another Balkan explosion in the obscure province of Kosovo, the region from where in 1989 Slobodan Milosevic, then the Stalinist president of all Yugoslavia, launched his Serbian nationalist drive. On the battlefield of Kosovo Polje, where Serbs suffered a catastrophic defeat under swords of the Turks 600 years ago, Milosevic cried for a Greater Serbia and triggered wars in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia which dismembered the Yugoslav federation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With his authority now waning in rump Serbia, as opposition to his totalitarian, economically disastrous rule grows, Milosevic is again playing the Kosovo card, hoping to tap raw Serbian pride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Kosovo, ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one. For all Serbs, Kosovo is holy ground, a symbol of the eternal threat by the Islamic hordes to people spawned by the Christian Orthodox book (with Marx's works thrown in later).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Albanians have therefore been historically subjugated, and continue to be repressed. But suddenly -in parallel with the prolonged </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations being led in Belgrade by the Zajedno opposition coalition - the underground Albanian independence </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Kosovo has acquired new energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have been several attacks on Serb security police and the Serb rector of Pristina University in Kosovo was critically injured in a car bombing this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a subtle twist of state propaganda, Zajedno, which is no more sympathetic than Milosevic's Socialist Party to the Albanians, has been accused of fomenting the Kosovo unrest. Analysts believe Milosevic will use this as a pretext for declaring a state of emergency, arguing that national security is threatened, and crack down harshly on both Zajedno and Kosovo's Albanian majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such trouble in Kosovo could be the signal for a violent endgame to the Yugoslav/Serbia crisis which Milosevic began all those years ago in pursuit of absolute power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FROM the northern city of Novi Sad to Leskovac in the south Serbs took to the streets last night to demand the resignation of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yugoslavia's opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Alliance for Change, held rallies in 20 of Yugoslavia's largest cities and vowed to continue demonstrating every day at 6pm until Mr Milosevic resigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rally drew moderate crowds in most cities, but Alliance leaders are convinced the crowds will grow in size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The biggest rally was at Republic Square in Belgrade, drawing tens of thousands of citizens under a persistent drizzle. In the same spot where Serbs once demonstrated against NATO's bombing, opposition leaders blamed Mr Milosevic for the country's woes and vowed to topple his &quot;criminal regime&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church issued a statement over the weekend calling on Serbs to put aside individual and party interests for the good of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What are a few bruises to secure our nation's future?&quot; asked Kristina Peric, an opposition leader from Valjevo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The principal speaker, Zoran Djindjic, the president of the Democratic Party, told the crowd it was time for action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We all know that we're not here just to talk, but to discuss what to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Let's do what everyone knows must be done. That man crouching in his bunker knows what's coming. This is not fun and games. We have a difficult job. We can't gather on squares for the next 100 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After Mr Djindjic's speech, the crowd marched to Radio Television Serbia then to the offices of Politika, the state run newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The march followed the same path as in 1996 and 1997 when Belgrade residents demonstrated for three months after Milosevic overturned municipal election results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crowd steadily grew in size as the demonstrators wound through Belgrade's streets chanting &quot;Thieves&quot; and &quot;It has begun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Alliance for Change had been preparing for yesterday's protest all summer, organising dozens of rallies after NATO ended its 78-day bombing campaign of Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Efforts to unite Vuk Draskovic's Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Alliance for Change collapsed last month at a Belgrade rally. Mr Draskovic wants to go to elections under the Milosevic government while the Alliance is demanding that Mr Milosevic resign, and then have elections under a transition government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Alliance, a coalition of 35 political organisations, last week elected the extremely popular Dragoslav Avramovic to head an eventual transition government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the former head of the Yugoslav National Bank, Mr Avramovic, now in his 80s, stopped hyper-inflation in 1993 by pegging the Yugoslav dinar to the Deutschmark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yugoslavia's politically jaded citizens are no longer easily goaded to demonstrate despite Milosevic's abysmal standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several large demonstrations since 1991 failed to produce results. But Alliance leaders say this time will be different. &quot;Last time, we didn't take the final step,&quot; said Alliance co-ordinator Vladan Batic. &quot;This time, we're going all the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Alliance is hoping that economic frustration and the looming winter will get people out in larger numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country's shattered infrastructure and economic isolation have left citizens with the lowest salaries in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Belgrade's Institute for Foreign Trade noted that Yugoslavia's economy has returned to an agrarian economy similar to 1945.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While some are sceptical that the Alliance can by itself topple Mr Milosevic in the immediate future, others say that anything can happen. Mr Draskovic said his party would also take to the streets if the Milosevic government does not call early elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am optimistic we will have massive support on the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My impression is that we've reached the bottom line. They will come out because they have nothing left,&quot; said Milan Protic, a historian and president of the Defence political group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People speak of fatigue, but I think that will eventually contribute to this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We're facing winter with a shortage of electricity. These objective problems will bring Milosevic to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition leaders agree this is a last opportunity. &quot;Every morning you should splash cold water on your face and say 'We can't pass up this opportunity',&quot; said Mr Djindjic last night.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gillian Sandford in Belgrade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbia's president, Milan Milutinovic, is said to be under house arrest and to have fallen out of favour with his long-time political ally, the Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, according to an opposition spokesman - a report the government denies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milutinovic, a member of Mr Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia, has been indicted for war crimes by the Hague tribunal in connection with events in Kosovo this year. Before he was Serbian president, he was the Yugoslav foreign minister and Yugoslav ambassador to Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reports of his confinement come at a time when many of Mr Milosevic's circle are rumoured to be increasingly concerned about their future - either because they are sought by the Hague tribunal or because they are blocked from leaving the country while they remain on a list of 300 Yugoslav officials unable to travel to European Union countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milutinovic is also on the list. Ironically, he fought his presidential election campaign on the internationalist slogan: 'Serbia and the world.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The concerns about Mr Milutinovic were first voiced on Friday by a leading official in the New Democracy party, Zarko Jokanovic. He said: 'There are indications that the Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, is under house arrest, that he is prevented from performing his duties, that he has fallen into disfavour with the ruling family and that his life is threatened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Jokanovic called for the creation of an independent commission to investigate whether Mr Milutinovic was capable of carrying out his constitutional duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milutinovic has not been prominent in public life for several weeks. A fortnight ago the Belgrade press reported that he was in hospital with high blood pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is difficult to confirm exactly what, if anything, has happened to him. The government has dismissed the reports, and Serbia's deputy information minister, Radmila Vasic, said Mr Jokanovic was speaking 'absolute rubbish&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She added: 'Milutinovic works daily and there are no problems with his work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the rumours of his confinement surfaced again at the weekend. Nebojsa Covic, president of the Democratic Alternative, said: 'This has to be checked, but there are indications that this is true and that some other people from the same party are in a similar situation.&quot; He did not say who the other people were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The claims come at a time when President Milosevic appears to have ridden out the wave of opposition protests that swept towns across the country in the summer, when thousands gathered, calling for him to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some opposition leaders are seeking to regroup and regain the momentum they lost after a disastrous demonstration in Belgrade on August 19, when their bitter rivalries burst into the open at what was to have been a major show of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> defiance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The umbrella opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alliance for Change has scheduled another rally in Belgrade for September 21, which it says will herald widespread protests, including strike action aimed at toppling the Milosevic regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the alliance's failure to capitalise on events earlier this summer has left its credibility low, and it is not certain that the new protests will be widely supported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to an independent poll by the Partnership agency in mid-August, the alliance is a small group which is supported by only 14.8% of Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If it were to unite with the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Vuk Draskovic, it would be far better placed. But Mr Draskovic is blamed by many in the alliance for sabotaging the August 19 rally, so that a reunion seems unlikely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spokesmen for Mr Milosevic's party and for Mr Draskovic are talking about the possibility of early elections. Commentators say that even if elections were held soon, they do not expect a shift in the balance of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Partnership poll, Mr Draskovic's party would win 18% of the vote, and the governing coalition would win 24%.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a lonely road south of Belgrade, a truck loaded with sand plowed into a convoy carrying Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic and four others to a Sunday picnic last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only Draskovic survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the driver of the killer truck has vanished and the truck's license number has been wiped from official rolls. Witnesses are scared, and few harbor any doubt that the fiery Oct. 3 crash was an attempt to assassinate Draskovic, the strongest rival to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With thousands flooding the streets nightly for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies, Belgrade is abuzz with speculation that the attack means the strongman is nervous. Political observers are anxious to see whether Draskovic's brush with death will push him to join the rallies, setting an explosive charge under a so-far-ineffectual campaign to topple Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope Vuk will now wholeheartedly join the opposition, but we'll see about that,&quot; said Milan Protic, a leader of the Alliance for Change, which is staging daily rallies calling for Milosevic's ouster. &quot;He's obviously under a lot of pressure -- from all sides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not a united front</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic, 52, is the leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO), the largest opposition party in Yugoslavia, but his divisions with other opposition leaders for years have hindered Milosevic's ouster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest dispute, the Alliance for Change has taken to the streets since late September, trying to force Milosevic to resign and clear the way for early elections. Milosevic is considered vulnerable since an 11-week NATO air war devastated Yugoslavia last spring and forced him to cede control of the Serbian province of Kosovo to international peacekeepers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The powerful and charismatic Draskovic has stayed away from the protests. He wants the opposition to push for elections while Milosevic is still in office. But in recent weeks, Draskovic began sending signals that he was ready to join forces with the Alliance for Change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few days before the crash, Studio B television, which Draskovic controls, began broadcasting the rallies -- including shots of police beating marchers headed for Milosevic's wealthy Belgrade neighborhood. Then Draskovic attended an opposition round-table meeting where the feuding factions finally began to resolve their differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few days later, Draskovic and an entourage including his brother-in-law Veselin Boskovic and at least three bodyguards set off from Belgrade for a picnic and political event. Boskovic drove Draskovic in an Audi sedan. The three bodyguards followed in a BMW.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to SPO officials, as the convoy neared the village of Lazarevac, 40 miles south of Belgrade, a large green truck swerved out of the oncoming lane and sideswiped the Audi. Boskovic died of a broken neck. Draskovic, knocked unconscious by the erupting air bag, suffered minor injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truck then smashed head-on into the BMW and burst into flames. The bodyguards died instantly. The driver of the truck had vanished when police arrived minutes later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, police have produced no information about the truck. The serial number is visible on its charred chassis, but they haven't found the owner. The license number -- Belgrade 994-704 -- is the only one missing from a long sequence of numbers in the registry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That police couldn't find the tag, the owner or the driver even after finding the chassis number is totally unbelievable,&quot; said SPO attorney Borivoje Borovic, who is conducting an independent inquiry. &quot;Obviously, they don't want to get involved in this investigation in a meaningful way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More curious, while police have been questioning -- and intimidating -- dozens of residents of Lazarevac, they have not interviewed Draskovic, the only surviving witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only substantive statement of any kind from police headquarters has been the assertion that Draskovic's convoy was speeding, which Draskovic denies. Authorities have referred the case to a local court in Lazarevac, which is treating it as a routine accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Begging to differ</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic, SPO officials and other opposition leaders quickly denied that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is an assassination attempt. Those who organized it should consider what will happen to them,&quot; Draskovic told Studio B. &quot;By the grace of God, Iwas the only one left alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The elimination of political adversaries by staging car accidents is a method already seen in these parts,&quot; said a New Democracy party statement. &quot;The perpetrators are obviously in big trouble as they will resort even to murder in order to accomplish their dark objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE -- Amid fears of war and election fraud, Vojislav Kostunica, leader of the newly founded Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) alliance, officially kicked off his campaign to replace Slobodan Milosevic as Yugoslavia's president by promising to ''stop the decline of the (Serb) state and nation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made the pledge in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, late last week during a brief party convention that introduced the DOS's platform and candidates for parliamentary and presidential elections Sept. 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is a new beginning for us,'' university professor Marija Bogdanovic said afterwards. ''I cried listening to his speech.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition has reason to be hopeful. Mr. Kostunica, a popular figure in Serb politics, is leading the largest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be assembled in Serbia in years. With Yugoslavia on the verge of war and economic collapse, Mr. Milosevic's days in power should be numbered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Yugoslavia is split between those who think the election will usher in a new leader and and a new beginning, and those who argue the vote can only strengthen Mr. Milosevic, who has artfully and brutally fended off challengers since coming to power a dozen years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Mr. Milosevic's iron rule, many of his opponents say they have a winning formula and candidate. In his keynote convention speech, Mr. Kostunica, a straight-taking law professor, reached out to voters with a 10-point platform for getting Serbia back on track. The DOS, echoing U. S. Republican party rhetoric from the 1990s, calls the platform its ''Contract with Serbia.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The platform points include promises for ''honest'' government, economic development, renewed ties with the West and an end to trade sanctions, anti-crime initiatives, a peaceful resolution of the crisis in Montenegro, and ''fair wages for honest work.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kostunica's more dynamic promises include bringing stability to Kosovo, assurances DOS's candidates will not try to profit from elected office, and not to seek revenge against political opponents should the DOS win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revenge is a sensitive issue, especially among pro-government bureaucrats fearful a change in regime will lead to their ouster and persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''During the last 10 years, they (the Milosevic regime) have created another artificial face of Serbia and unfortunately the world believes this image,'' Mr. Kostunica said. ''We will present the true face of Serbia.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheering conventioneers appeared to be impressed by Mr. Kostunica's words and style. Clearly, Mr. Kostunica, an obscure opposition figure until his recent ascendency to the top of DOS, walks and talks differently than other Serb politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DOS leader has a reputation for being a nationalist and a conservative. But he has so far refused to use reactionary rhetoric to appeal to Serbian hardliners in the way that other opposition leaders -- such as Vuk Draskovic, the now diminished leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO) in hiding in Montenegro after a recent assassination attempt, and Vojislav Seselj, the reactionary leader of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) -- have done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kostunica's strongest attributes appear to be a reputation for honesty and a squeaky-clean record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic and Mr. Seselj have both cut deals with Mr. Milosevic for personal and political gain. Mr. Seselj's Radicals are a cornerstone of Mr. Milosevic's parliamentary coalition, and Mr.  Draskovic abandoned his leadership of student protests three years ago to become a deputy prime minister in the Milosevic government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic has refused to stand behind Mr. Kostunica in a united front against Mr. Milosevic as both the SPO and SRS run their own candidates for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even with the concern that opposition votes will be divided on election day, Mr. Kostunica's supporters are optimistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think we'll be successful,'' declared DOS parliamentary candidate Jeljko Ciric. ''I wouldn't be involved otherwise.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public opinion polls predict a DOS victory. According to an editor for the Belgrade newsmagazine NIN, Mr. Kostunica now enjoys about 35-per-cent support in Yugoslavia, compared to 24 per cent for Mr. Milosevic. Poll data released in July put Mr. Kostunica's approval rating at 42 per cent, and Mr. Milosevic's at 28 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NIN puts support for Mr.  Draskovic's SPO in the single digits (eight per cent), but has no idea how much support the Radicals enjoy due to SRS leader Mr. Seselj's order that supporters not co-operate with pollsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top officials in Yugoslavia's ruling coalition formally declared Mr. Milosevic's candidacy for re-election Sunday, submitting the results of a petition drive intended to show off his support and counter the polls showing the president trailing Mr. Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition drive reportedly collected nearly 1.6 million signatures supporting the president even though only 25,000 are required for a candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This clearly shows people's support for Milosevic's policies of defending national sovereignty, resistance against aggressors, of reconstruction and development,'' said Gorica Gajevic, the secretary general of Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Ciric predicts Mr. Kostunica will triumph on a second ballot, which will be required if there is no clear majority winner on the first ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Kostunica will win, '' said Mr. Ciric, ''if Milosevic doesn't create a crisis in Montenegro or Kosovo, or if he doesn't cheat.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weary of political infighting and unsure of which reformist faction to support, more than half the Serbian electorate did not vote in today's presidential election, rendering the result invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">     Under legislation dating from Slobodan Milosevic's autocratic rule in the 1990's, if less than 50 percent of the voters turn out, the election must be held again within two months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just 45.4 percent ventured into heavy rain to cast their ballots today, ignoring warnings from both presidential candidates that a failed election would only drag out the political instability that is holding back Serbia's economic recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbia's current president, Milan Milutinovic, has been indicted by the United Nations war crimes tribunal at The Hague, where Mr. Milosevic is on trial, and is widely expected to surrender once his term expires at the end of this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preliminary results from today's vote showed that Vojislav Kostunica, a conservative nationalist who replaced Mr. Milosevic as president of Yugoslavia, easily defeated Miroljub Labus, a pro-Western liberal and architect of the government's economic reform program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kostunica, who is seeking a new job before the Yugoslav federation grouping Serbia and Montenegro is abolished, won 66.7 percent of the vote against 31.3 percent for Mr. Labus, according to Belgrade's Center for Free Elections and Democracy, which monitored the ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men are veterans of the disparate alliance of reformers that ousted Mr. Milosevic two years ago but they represent two rival factions that quickly emerged from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bitter power struggle between the two camps -- one led by Mr. Kostunica, the other by the Serbian prime minister, Zoran Djindjic -- has brought reforms to a standstill and alienated voters desperate for living standards to improve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Serbs are tired of political squabbling,&quot; said Jovan Maric, a psychiatrist and prominent commentator on social issues. &quot;These elections were a slap in the face for Djindjic. They have sent a signal to the government that it needs to do something dramatic to make people's lives better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the state broadcaster RTS and a couple of small independent channels, television networks did not broadcast special election programs tonight, reflecting a widespread lack of interest in the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many observers fear that politicians will now devote their attention to electioneering rather than the economic and political reforms Serbia needs to recover from a decade of wars, international isolation and impoverishment under Mr. Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the campaign is as contentious as this one has been, it could prove just as difficult to motivate the electorate in two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People don't see anything to vote for and neither candidate gave them much of an incentive,&quot; one Western diplomat said. &quot;After Labus lost the first round, there were only two conceivable outcomes in the runoff -- a Kostunica victory and a failed election. Both just mean further political uncertainty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mr. Labus said he had not yet decided whether to run again, he is unlikely to have Mr. Djindjic's backing after today's result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kostunica, who is Serbia's most popular politician, is demanding that a general election be held as soon as possible in the hope of gaining control of Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Serbian president, he would be better placed to persuade some of the 17 parties in Mr. Djindjic's coalition to join his camp and rob the government of its majority. Political survival for Mr. Djindjic, who is personally unpopular with voters, largely depends on his ability to thwart Mr. Kostunica's ambitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless these two men can reconcile their differences or one of them wins, their power struggle will continue to dictate post-Milosevic politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problems with our politicians is vanity,&quot; said Radmilo Kljajic, a columnist for Serbia's leading daily newspaper, Politika. &quot;The government did not actually implement changes, but tried to hang onto power using Milosevic's laws.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON, Sept. 22</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After more than seven years opposing President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia on the battlefield and in the negotiating room, the Clinton administration is making one last stand against him -- among the voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a high-profile strategy that began a year ago, the administration has helped finance an opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that is backing Vojislav Kostunica in his campaign to unseat Mr. Milosevic from the Yugoslav presidency in voting on Sunday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even if, as almost everyone expects, Mr. Milosevic simply declares himself the victor, Washington is hoping that angry voters will take to the streets in a way that eventually drives him from office, much as Ferdinand E. Marcos was ousted in the Philippines in 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy largely reflects the thinking of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who has made democracy a centerpiece of her tenure and has cast Mr. Milosevic as her most bitter enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the plan, which has ranged from bringing fractious opposition leaders here to meet Dr. Albright in her seventh-floor suite at the State Department to pumping million of dollars into voter education groups and the independent media, has its risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one thing, Mr. Kostunica is a Serbian nationalist who does not necessarily support the NATO presence in Kosovo. Without an official American presence in Serbia, it is difficult to gauge how much of the $25 million spent on the opposition over the last year has been fruitfully used. In fact, the blatant American campaign against Mr. Milosevic has given him a powerful theme for his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration officials who devised the strategy said they believed that Mr. Milosevic, regardless of the vote tallies, would manipulate the results and declare victory. In the best case, the officials said, they hoped that opposition protests would eventually lead Mr. Milosevic's all-important army and security forces to turn against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people of Yugoslavia are standing up,&quot; said James C. O'Brien, special adviser to President Clinton and Dr. Albright on democracy in the Balkans. &quot;They believe it's time for change. There is the potential for seismic change in Yugoslavia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration, Mr. O'Brien suggested, hopes that the elections will provide a &quot;crucial moment, like the Berlin Wall falling.&quot; But he said Washington would settle for a &quot;tide turning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, noted recently that &quot;people power&quot; spelled the end in Manila in 1986 and that the same </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could occur now in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other officials acknowledged, however, that it was unclear how motivated the opposition would be to protest, whether it could rouse a weary population to rally in great numbers and whether the security forces would turn against Mr. Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To encourage opposition activities in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, the United States has spent $25 million in the last year, according to Donald L. Pressley, the assistant administrator at the United States Agency for International Development. Nearly half of the money, $11 million, was spent on helping unions, media organizations and civic associations, Mr. Pressley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two groups here, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, were allocated $4 million to help groups in Serbia campaign door to door and to develop other get-out-the-vote techniques, Mr. Pressley said. Much of the remaining money went to Serbian cities like Nis and Novi Sad, which are run by independent mayors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because American officials are barred from Serbia, a satellite embassy, under the direction of Ambassador William Montgomery, was established in Budapest in the summer to be the fulcrum for the effort to build democracy in Serbia. From Budapest, conferences have been organized in southern Hungary to bring Serbians together with turnout experts from Central Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Agency for International Development has given contracts to establish nongovernmental organizations like Freedom House and the German Marshall Fund, which give grants to Central European groups that have access to Serbia, Mr. Pressley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, O.K. 98, a group that helped unseat Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar in Slovakia in 1998, is working alongside Serbian groups in door-to-door canvassing, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Serbia, there have been complaints that some of the foreign activity enriches individuals with cash, cell phones and faxes. Mr. Pressley said that $1.5 million of the $25 million effort was earmarked for audits and that A.I.D.'s Budapest operation for Serbia included an auditor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administration officials, following their usual policy, refused to confirm or deny the existence of covert operations in Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One main reason for optimism in the administration is that officials apparently believe that their carefully devised effort to build democracy has helped magnify interest in the opposition candidate, Mr. Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rarely in more than seven years of dealing with Mr. Milosevic has the Clinton administration sounded so upbeat. Nor have officials been so willing to advertise their policy. One official said this week that he had to warn about too much euphoria inside the State Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration has had little to do with Mr. Kostunica, a law professor who has maintained a fierce independence from American policy and who has said that if he came to power he would not send Mr. Milosevic to the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. The tribunal indicted Mr. Milosevic last year for what it said were crimes committed by his security forces in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Albright has watched enthusiastically as more than a dozen parties in Serbia's famously fractured opposition decided to back Mr. Kostunica. Administration officials are also upbeat because, they say, they believe that Mr. Milosevic miscalculated by suddenly calling the elections in July, making this his first direct electoral test since 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unanswered question in the strategy is what happens after the vote. In his 13 years in power, Mr. Milosevic has repeatedly shown his ability to maneuver, manipulating allies and rivals to maintain his grip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some administration officials said they believed that if Mr. Milosevic did not lose by a wide margin and, therefore, did not resort to extensive fraud, there would be a less compelling case for protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other officials argue that ordinary people, buffeted by a bad economy and accepting of official propaganda that the opposition is backed by foreign interests, lack the passion for an enduring show of protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other questions concern whether the police and soldiers are prepared to use large-scale force against fellow Serbs. If they are, that raises a question about how much the administration should encourage protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is this going to be like 1956?&quot; asked one senior administration official, recalling the Western hints to the Hungarians that help would be on the way if the Soviet Union quashed the uprising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last several days, Bratislav Grubacic, a Serbian journalist who is widely read in the Western diplomatic community, has warned that Mr. Milosevic will attempt to stay in power at any cost. &quot;The bigger danger for the Serbs,&quot; Mr. Grubacic wrote, &quot;is that the authorities could apply repressive measures such as those in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HUNDREDS of mourners yesterday laid to rest Veselin Boskovic, the brother-in -law of Yugoslavia's most popular opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Boskovic was killed in a catastrophic car accident on Sunday afternoon, which Mr Draskovic survived - and claims was an assassination attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It wasn't you who they wanted to kill, but me,&quot; Mr Draskovic said before hundreds of mourners at yesterday's funeral. &quot;God, hasn't it been enough? Hasn't enough blood been spilled?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three of Mr Draskovic's bodyguards were killed along with Mr Boskovic in Sunday's crash. The word &quot;killers&quot; was heard repeatedly between sobs at the Topcider cemetery near Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Representatives from rival opposition parties turned out to pay their respects to Mr Boskovic. Vuk Obradovic, a retired general and president of the Social Democratic party attended the funeral, as did representatives from other opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Mr Draskovic's claim of an assassination attempt turns out to be correct, the deaths of his entourage could serve as a final catalyst to unify Yugoslavia's opposition and invigorate efforts to unseat the president, Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Details of Mr Draskovic's accident continue to baffle the public.  A large truck filled with several tonnes of sand crossed into the oncoming lane of traffic and hit two cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic's car, driven by Mr Boskovic, flipped on its roof and landed on an embankment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The car carrying Mr Draskovic's three bodyguards burst into flames when it collided head-on with the truck. The truck's driver disappeared from the scene and police have not been able to identify its owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An investigator told Mr Draskovic's lawyer on Monday that the driver had been caught. But at a press conference later that day, Mr Draskovic's spokesman, Ivan Kovacevic, said that police still had no driver, that the truck's licence plates were missing, and that the owner still had not been identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The alleged assassination attempt occurred at a critical juncture in Yugoslavia's growing opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic has benefited from a divided opposition since 1997, but especially so after NATO's 78-day bombing campaign ended in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, though, a representative from Mr Draskovic's party met with opposition rivals for the first time in more than two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition parties discussed conditions for fair elections and agreed to continue discussions in one week. Leaders characterised the meeting as &quot;very productive and positive&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic and his rivals had stopped bickering publicly, while the Draskovic-controlled Belgrade television station, Studio B, has begun giving prominent coverage to the nightly protest marches led by his rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent days, Studio B's signal has been interfered with during news broadcasts while state television has called the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protesters &quot;hooligans&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts agree the protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will falter without the eventual participation of Mr Draskovic's party. Mr Draskovic was also under increasing pressure from his constituents to get involved in street protests, once police began beating demonstrators last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition leaders are withholding judgment about the car crash until further evidence is collected, but many in the opposition strongly suspect it was indeed an attempt on Mr Draskovic's life, with the aim of derailing a gradually uniting opposition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;WE will do all we can to help you, but it's up to you to get rid of the regime.&quot; So said the US state department special envoy, Bob Gelbard, at the meeting of Yugoslav opposition leaders assembled in Montenegro last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Gelbard was a surprise arrival. He came accompanied by Milan Panic, the US pharmaceuticals magnate who defected to the West in 1956 while representing Yugoslavia in an international cycling event in the Netherlands. Mr Panic was appointed Yugoslav federal prime minister by Slobodan Milosevic in July 1992 when the Serb leader was keen to present a western friendly image to the international community. He rapidly showed true independence of mind, famously telling Mr Milosevic to &quot;shut up&quot; during international peace talks on Bosnia and then standing against him for the Serbian presidency in December 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Panic's presence at Mr Gelbard's side gives grounds for cautious optimism about western diplomatic strategy towards the Yugoslav opposition. The emigre millionaire might have won the 1992 election if he had not been badly let down by the West. He ran neck and neck with Mr Milosevic in the opinion polls. But his appeal to the Yugoslav electorate was based on a promise to end international sanctions against the country. It was a commitment he could deliver only with US and British help.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The West kept the sanctions in place and Mr Milosevic was able to portray his opponent as a weakling who cosied up to Serbia's enemies without winning anything in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Panic's experience was not unique. Zoran Djindjic, the western-educated liberal intellectual who also attended the Montenegro gathering, has had equally bitter experience of Western betrayal when he most desperately needed help. Mr Djindjic was one of the leaders of the Zajedno opposition alliance which brought Mr Milosevic to the brink of defeat during the &quot;whistling revolution&quot; which followed his government's decision to annul election results which had handed the opposition major victories in local elections held in late 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between December of that year and February 1997, Mr Djindjic, together with the mercurial Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brought tens of thousands of protesters on to the streets of Belgrade and Nis to demand recognition of the election results, democratic reform, economic liberalisation and the end of the Milosevic era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zajedno </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> generated huge support and soon created the impression that power was inexorably draining away from the Milosevic regime. A counter rally organised by the Serbian Socialist Party was a disaster, attracting only a tiny fraction of the numbers brought onto the streets by the Zajedno leaders, and providing graphic evidence that Mr Milosevic no longer spoke for his people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What happened next must still scare the leaders who met Mr Gelbard in Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of backing the opposition to the hilt, western ambassadors backed away from their initial enthusiasm for the protesters and encouraged them to compromise with the Milosevic authorities. Zajedno collapsed amid much internal squabbling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Had Mr Panic won in 1992 the disasters which followed in Bosnia might not have happened. If Zajedno had triumphed in 1997 the war in Kosovo might well have been avoided. Lack of clear and determined western support was one of the key factors which undermined both of these chances to build a more liberal Serbia. Mr Panic and Mr Djindjic will have made this point to Bob Gelbard. That he travelled to the meeting uninvited and with Mr Panic at his side may be taken as an indication that the United States at least has learned the lesson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crucial test now is how well it has learned it and how many of its allies Washington can bring with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western doubts about the Yugoslav opposition are not without foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coalitions have broken up time and time again as individual party leaders have sought personal advantage by doing deals with the Belgrade government. Vuk Draskovic, who did not attend the meeting in Montenegro, has swung like a yoyo between fierce hostility to the Yugoslav president and ministerial office in his government. NATO governments are entitled to wonder if, this time, the opposition can work together to achieve change. The answer must be a tentative yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KFOR troops had barely crossed the Kosovo border when Mr Gelbard travelled to Montenegro, carefully avoiding the attentions of Yugoslav secret police as he went. The timing of his mission was right and so was the membership of the gathering he attended. Milo Djukanovic, the 37-year-old democratically elected president of Montenegro, heads the only remaining republic of Federal Yugoslavia beyond Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has stood out against Mr Milosevic throughout the NATO air campaign and retains the enthusiastic support of his people. Zoran Djindjic speaks for a small but significant body of sophisticated urban Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milan Panic brings the promise of western aid to reconstruct Serbia and renewed membership of the world community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With real backing from NATO these men can form the nucleus of a credible challenge to Mr Milosevic. But they will need a lot more than kind words. Mr Milosevic retains the certain loyalty of his paramilitary police, though he may not be so confident about the army. As an indicted war criminal he has nowhere to flee. But he has wriggled out of crisis after crisis in his long and bloody career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is a rat in a trap and will fight like one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How can NATO best promote a convincing opposition challenge? There must be a concrete promise of money for reconstruction and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic's media machine must be challenged by the use of radio and television broadcasts into Serbia. Those who he might order to turn their weapons on opposition protesters must be convinced that this time he really cannot survive. The ringing condemnation issued by the Serbian Orthodox church must be exploited for all it is worth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Above all, the West must be resolute. Mr Milosevic is facing his biggest ever challenge. His economy is in ruins. The sacred heartland of Kosovo is in the hands of NATO and the KLA. His people are hurting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He will appeal to his traditional supporters on the grounds that those who wish to replace him are pro-Western traitors working in cahoots with those who have bombed Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This may work for a while. But it will not feed people or heat their homes when the harsh Balkan winter sets in. Nor will it accommodate the thousands of Serbian refugees now fleeing Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having found the resolve to pursue the war to a successful conclusion, NATO must demonstrate a similar commitment to winning the peace. That means active support for the opposition, including a commitment to use force again if Mr Milosevic turns his guns against his own people in a last ditch attempt to escape the fate which ended the career of his former neighbour and ideological soul-mate Nicolae Ceausescu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slobodan Milosevic is not invincible. He has been brought to the brink before and can be pushed over it this time. Mr Gelbard was right to say that the primary impetus for change must come from within Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it cannot come from Serbs alone. The West must understand that with Mr Milosevic still in power, victory in Kosovo is no victory at all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Airlines canceled at least 120 flights at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport yesterday, a day after canceling 150 flights there because of a pilot shortage. The airline blamed the cancellations on pilots who have refused to work overtime since their contract expired in April. The union has denied there is an organized effort to refuse overtime work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers want history of SLA barred at trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorneys for former Symbionese Liberation Army fugitive Sara Jane Olson asked a California state appeals court last week to bar evidence about the radical group's violent history at Olson's trial in Los Angeles. Superior Court Judge James Ideman ruled earlier this year that prosecutors could discuss the entire history of the SLA when Olson goes on trial in January. She is charged with attempting to kill Los Angeles police officers in 1975; pipe bombs used in the attempt did not detonate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida coastal fishing to get more restrictions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal government will further restrict fishing off much of the Florida coast beginning this fall to try to protect migratory species such as tuna, swordfish and shark in the overfished region. The National Marine Fisheries Service ban on open-water longline fishing, a method used by about 450 commercial boats in the region, could cut some fishermen's revenues by 10 percent, the government estimated over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gunman surrenders after deputy is killed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Port Angeles, Wash., a gunman suspected of killing a sheriff's deputy surrendered yesterday to police officers who were negotiating with him and firing tear gas into his house in an attempt to end the day-old standoff. Thomas M. Roberts, 53, who has a history of mental problems, was taken into custody after walking out of the house. Wallace E. &quot;Wally&quot; Davis, 48 - a sheriff's deputy, writer and father of three, with a fourth child due in February - died after he was shot when he responded to a report of a disturbance at the suspect's house on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hurricane Alberto still far from land</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hurricane Alberto, the first of the Atlantic hurricane season, kept moving westward yesterday while remaining far from land, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. Alberto, with maximum sustained winds of about 80 m.p.h. and occasionally higher gusts, was about 1,600 miles east of the Windward Islands in the Caribbean Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5 killed after truck goes wrong way on highway</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver of a pickup truck traveling the wrong direction on a Fort Worth, Texas, highway smashed into several vehicles Saturday night. Five people, including the pickup driver, were killed. Six others were injured. The pickup driver was apparently fleeing another wreck moments before the fatal crash on Highway 121, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THE WORLD Serbian opposition candidate to face Milosevic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbia's largest opposition party yesterday nominated its own candidate to oppose Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in September elections, ignoring appeals from other opposition groups to rally behind a common candidate. The Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nominated Belgrade Mayor Vojislav Mihailovic. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which had said it would boycott the elections, demanded that the other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parties support Mihailovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7 U.N. workers, 5 others killed in Afghanistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gunmen in Afghanistan shot and killed 12 people, including seven Afghans working for the United Nations' mine-clearing agency, in western Herat province, the organization said yesterday. The aid workers were killed near Kotal-e-Subzak early Saturday, the organization said. Officials of the Taliban militia that controls 90 percent of Afghanistan and the opposition traded accusations over who carried out the killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poland OKs development near Auschwitz</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Polish Interior Ministry has lifted a ban placed by local authorities on a visitors' center, cafeteria and parking lot near the former Nazi death camp near Auschwitz, developer Janusz Marszalek said yesterday. He said the ministry ordered the governor to reconsider his decision, saying it was based on the incorrect premise that a snack bar, shops and a parking lot already on the camp site would remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hiroshima marks 55th anniversary of bombing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tolling of a bell yesterday marked the day 55 years ago when the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. Sixty seconds of silent prayer in Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima began at 8:15 a.m., the moment the bomb dropped on Aug. 6, 1945, killing about 140,000 people. Three days later, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, killing 70,000 people. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945, ending World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mudslide in Swiss Alps kills three hikers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mudslide buried a group of mostly American hikers in the Swiss Alps yesterday, killing two of the tourists and their guide, police said. The victims were among about 20 walkers on a mountain trek from the First Grindelwald mountain to the Grosse Scheidegg peak in Switzerland's Berner Oberland region. The two tourists had not been identified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Aug. 17</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a severe blow to the effort to oust President Slobodan Milosevic, the leader of the largest opposition party and an influential former army general withdrew today from a major </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally scheduled for Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the opposition's best orator, said today that he would not take part in the rally because of the actions and behavior of the Alliance for Change, which is effectively led by his rival, Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democracy Party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Momcilo Perisic, whom Mr. Milosevic fired as army chief of staff last November, also pulled out, saying he did not support a transitional government of experts, one of the aims of the rally, but rather favored early elections for a new government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally, the first one in the capital, Belgrade, since Yugoslav troops pulled out of Kosovo, has been seen as a high point of a summer of waxing and waning protests against Mr. Milosevic. The rally and the turnout for it will be judged by all the players here as a test of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sentiment, and the Government has been attacking its organizers for various shortcomings -- including doing NATO's bidding and choosing to hold the rally on President Clinton's birthday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has also attacked Mr. Perisic with extraordinary fervor, labeling the former general, who is slight in stature, &quot;a small weakling,&quot; an &quot;unrealized male&quot; and &quot;General Clark's orderly,&quot; a reference to Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government, having tried to consolidate itself around the parties of Mr. Milosevic, his wife, Mirjana Markovic, and the ultranationalist politician Vojislav Seselj, is generally anxious about sentiment in Belgrade, however pleased it may be about a continually divided opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's developments will weaken the opposition and make it seem less credible to ordinary Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night before the rally, on Wednesday, there will be be a large crowd at the first soccer match between Yugoslavia and Croatia since the collapse of Tito's Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the crowd is likely to shout anti-Government slogans, the Government fears something more serious. There are rumors, reported in the Belgrade press, that the ruling parties have bought or secured a third of the seats -- up to 20,000 -- for their members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some officials feel that if Yugoslavia, which boasts a strong team, beats Croatia, the sense of good feeling may carry over to the Thursday rally. Or vice versa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bitter and visceral rivalry between Mr. Djindjic on one side and Mr. Draskovic and his powerful wife, Danica, on the other, has bedeviled and infuriated American diplomats trying to finish the war against Serbia with Mr. Milosevic's ouster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior American diplomat, Robert S. Gelbard, met in Serbia's sister republic of Montenegro with all key Yugoslav opposition leaders to plan strategy and provide advice and encouragement -- if not the millions of dollars that Mr. Milosevic's propaganda asserts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the visibility of American diplomats advising the domestic opposition on the ouster of the elected Yugoslav President has been a gift to Mr. Milosevic's propaganda machine, making it easy to tar the opposition as traitors or dupes of the nation that just bombed Belgrade and is overseeing the exodus of Serbs from Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues involved in Mr. Draskovic's decision today not to speak at the rally were personal, symbolic and substantive, his aides said. First, he disapproved of a change in the lineup of speakers for the rally that came just two hours after the list was issued. The new lineup included Vesna Pesic, the former Civic Alliance leader, and Velimir Ilic, Mayor of Cacak. Mr. Draskovic would not accept Mr. Ilic, his former deputy who joined with Mr. Djindjic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early this morning, Mr. Draskovic decided that he would not speak. Instead, his party's speaker will be a much less compelling figure, Spasoje Krunic, the chairman of Belgrade's executive council. Mr. Draskovic did, however, call on his supporters to come to Belgrade and take part in the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference today, Mr. Draskovic said, &quot;I cannot accept many, many stupid ideas of irresponsible people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the rally was too late and should have been held at the end of June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there were also substantive issues involved. Mr. Djindjic, the Alliance for Change generally and the Clinton Administration want Mr. Milosevic to resign as a first step and want him to be delivered, perhaps within six months, to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. They want a transitional government of experts to serve for a year to prepare for new elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic wonders how they intend to force Mr. Milosevic's resignation without violence, unrest and even &quot;civil war,&quot; and he has proposed either new, internationally supervised elections to replace Mr. Milosevic, or a transitional government, to be negotiated with the Government now in place, that would render Mr. Milosevic a figurehead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Draskovic says he now believes that Mr. Milosevic will never agree to a transitional government and that the time for such an idea is past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic's ideas are also vague, but he says he believes that Mr. Milosevic can be pushed or seduced to resign, presumably with some promise of immunity for his family and his assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Perisic, who has started his own </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is trying to induce members of the army, the police and current Government to leave the Milosevic circle. He agrees with the Alliance that Mr. Milosevic is not trustworthy and must be forced or persuaded to resign as a first step, said his spokesman, Boris Karajicic, a former student resistance leader. But Mr. Perisic wants early elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Perisic's views are closer to Mr. Draskovic's, and they both seem to want a more constitutional process than what the Alliance favors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Ms. Pesic, former leader of the Civic Alliance, even suggested that if Mr. Milosevic remained in office, &quot;the Romanian model, if need be,&quot; could not be ruled out. The Romanian dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, and his wife were overthrown and murdered in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic supporters immediately seized on Ms. Pesic's comments and the Serbian Prime Minister, Mirko Marjanovic, called the Alliance for Change, commonly disparaged as &quot;the Alliance for NATO,&quot; a &quot;terrorist organization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, according to state television, a prosecutor asked the police to examine evidence that Ms. Pesic is guilty of a felony charge for inciting and &quot;an attack on the constitutional system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is another reason Mr. Draskovic found her inclusion in the list of speakers unfortunate, aides say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alliance officials say Mr. Draskovic, who joined the Yugoslav Government in January but was fired during the war, is doing Mr. Milosevic's bidding. They say Mr. Draskovic, whose party controls Belgrade and its influential television station, Studio B, with the support of Mr. Milosevic's party, is being pressured by the Government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slobodan Milosevic switched jobs today, dropping his title of President of Serbia and emerging as President of the Yugoslav federation after a swearing-in ceremony in the federal Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intent on prolonging his 10-year rule but barred by the Constitution from serving again as President of Serbia, Mr. Milosevic maneuvered to take the Yugoslav presidency, until now a figurehead job.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After intense bargaining with leaders in Montenegro, which with Serbia makes up what is left of Yugoslavia, Mr. Milosevic managed last week to push through a majority vote in Parliament for his appointment as federal President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accompanied by his wife, Mira Markovic, Mr. Milosevic pledged in a brief speech to Parliament to rule over &quot;a peaceful, independent, just and developed country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But since the war that Mr. Milosevic presided over and that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Serbian economy has declined sharply and has become largely criminalized. The opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that protested in the streets of Belgrade against Mr. Milosevic last winter has faded, its principal leaders caught up with intramural political jockeying and the students who organized the demonstrations drained of energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only several hundred </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protesters appeared outside the federal Parliament today and were pushed aside before Mr. Milosevic entered. Several thousand university students, in a rare demonstration since the winter, were prevented from going to Parliament by a police cordon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Milosevic's supporters gathered outside Parliament, chanting their fealty to Mr. Milosevic and yelling &quot;Red Gangsters!&quot; to the opposition protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early 1990's, as President of Serbia, Mr. Milosevic promised to bring standards of living equivalent to those in Sweden and to build fast rail links that would integrate Serbia in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But instead the economy crashed under the weight of war, and the Dayton peace settlement has failed to improve the material well-being of Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Milosevic has refused to allow any meaningful privatization of the nationalized economy, unemployment hovers around 40 percent and the average wage has dropped to one-third its prewar value. Many Serbs say they believe that the economy is run for the direct interests of Mr. Milosevic and a few cronies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections for the Serbian presidency scheduled for Sept. 21 are likely to be boycotted by the opposition parties, according to Slobodan Vuksanovic, spokesman for the Democratic Party. The opposition is upset that Mr. Milosevic's party, the Socialist Party of Serbia, has changed the boundaries of election districts to favor its candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only declared candidate so far for the vacant Serbian presidency is the ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj, whose Serbian Radical Party provided many of the most violent Serbian paramilitary fighters in the Bosnian war. Mr. Seselj, who brandished a gun in front of the Serbian Parliament to scare away students several years ago, was among the first to line up and congratulate Mr. Milosevic after his swearing in today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Milosevic has not yet announced a candidate from his own party for his old job and appears to be favoring Mr. Seselj's candidacy. In his latest nationalistic action, Mr. Seselj, who is the Mayor of Zemun, a municipality of Belgrade, ordered the eviction of two Croatian families from their homes last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By having Mr. Seselj as President of Serbia, Mr. Milosevic could count on a faithful ally to control the powerful Serbian secret police. In an indication of how isolated Mr. Milosevic has remained after the war, the first telegram of congratulations read on state-run television today came from President Fidel Castro of Cuba.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Feuding rivals aid yet another escape act, says Eve-Ann Prentice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A SIGN by one of the bridges linking old and new Belgrade proudly announces the presence of a restaurant called the Argument. It seems to symbolise what is happening in Yugoslavia as the summer unfolds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For although the restaurant's name really means &quot;debate&quot; in English, rational discussion is almost absent among the myriad pro- and anti-government groups squabbling over where the country goes from here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two months after the end of Nato's bombing campaign, President Milosevic is still at the helm, buoyed by deep splits in the opposition, widespread popular resentment of the West, and the availability of food.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally to be held in Belgrade tomorrow has long been billed as a potentially crucial point in the build-up of opposition. But plans for the protest were in disarray yesterday after Vuk Draskovic, one of the two main opposition leaders, announced that he would not address the gathering. His decision followed days of wrangling about who should speak and in what order. &quot;There have been so many problems concerning the organisation of the rally,&quot; said a spokesman for Mr Draskovic's Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Another official will speak in his place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other main opposition group is the umbrella Alliance for Change led by Zoran Djindjic, the Democratic Party leader. Mr Djindjic and Mr Draskovic are now deeply antagonistic towards one another, even though once allies. Mr Djindjic generally receives support from entrepreneurial Serbs, especially those who would like to do business abroad, while Mr Draskovic has a more mystical air which appeals to the Serbian Orthodox psyche.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many ordinary Serbs are dismayed that the two cannot put aside their differences and present a united front. &quot;Do they think they are organising another Woodstock on Thursday?&quot; said a group of Belgrade students yesterday. Young and old are pessimistic about the future, fearing a cash and power-starved winter. But although they grumble about the Milosevic regime, ordinary Serbs are often even more scathing about the West and feel unfairly vilified. The perceived failure of Kfor to protect Kosovo's Serbs from Albanians has added to the sense of Serbs standing alone against the world - and may have boosted Mr Milosevic's support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The West hopes that tightening the sanctions screw on Serbia will increase the chances of a popular insurrection against Mr Milosevic, but the evidence here seems to be that this policy is having the opposite effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public anger at the regime was probably at its height in the first month after the Kosovo campaign, when tens of thousands of conscripted troops came home and the extent of the debacle became clear to people with little or no access to outside information. This was especially true in southern and central towns which provided most troops for Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tens of thousands joined organised and spontaneous anti-government rallies in towns such as Cacak, Valjevo, Krusevac and Leskovac. Today, these rallies usually attract no more than a few hundred. In Leskovac this week, even those at the heart of the dwindling protest meetings admitted that villagers in the area would almost certainly vote for Mr Milosevic in an election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonetheless, the Government is clearly uneasy about tomorrow's protest, which opposition leaders had hoped would attract more than 100,000 people before Mr Draskovic's decision not to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic, meanwhile, seems to be using his proven tactic of carrot and stick. The carrot is the regime's occasional deliberate indulgence. Police have tended to stand back at protest meetings, and they increasingly turn a blind eye to black marketeering. Petrol is openly available from hundreds of roadside entrepreneurs selling it for about DM5 (about Pounds 1.78) a litre from plastic bottles, while garages stand largely deserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although there is genuine hunger among hundreds of thousands of near-destitute refugees from Croatia and Bosnia, let alone Kosovo, most Serbs are kept blissfully ignorant of these woes and they have enough money for now to buy food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the threat of force is never far away. In Valjevo yesterday, Bogoljub Arsenijevic, a self-proclaimed opposition figure, was arrested and beaten up, his colleagues said. He had recently joined forces with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for Democratic Serbia, founded by a former Army Chief of Staff, Momcilo Perisic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State newspapers and television are launching vehement attacks on opposition leaders, accusing them of trying to generate unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tomorrow's protest takes place on President Clinton's birthday. The following day Mr Milosevic celebrates his 58th birthday. Despite the West's wishes, no clear signs have emerged to indicate that it will be his last in power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;TEN YEARS ago, before everything that happened here, we had a life,&quot; recalled Ljiljana Nonin. &quot;We planned our holidays, went to the Croatian seaside every year, to Spain, bought furniture. We could plan and manage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now the family struggles to survive on pounds 70 a month. &quot;It's so hard to survive,&quot; Mrs Nonin said. &quot;You don't know what to buy for lunch or how to pay the electricity. Bills come and you put them aside. You have to eat to survive.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nine months after the Nato bombardment ended, Serbia is a depressed and depressing place. The regime is slowly squeezing the life out of its people and the opposition parties seem powerless to offer any way out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The independent media are being shut down one by one. Kosovo is boiling with tension, while Montenegro looks likely to become the next target of Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia's President. Caught in the middle, 7.5 million confused Serbs, such as Ljiljana Nonin, struggle to survive in an impoverished state where only farms, electricity plants and some small businesses manage to keep going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Teachers have been on strike for seven weeks now, demanding to be paid. Long lines of pensioners in shabby clothes gather around the entrances to supermarkets. They queue for hours to buy two litres of cooking oil, sugar, some meat - if it eventually arrives. Some days they have to go home empty-handed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is not a simple or a single word that could describe how we live now,&quot; said Mrs Nonin, a middle-aged Belgrade woman. &quot;Ordinary people are depressed, desperate and more frightened than ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nonins live in a small apartment in downtown Belgrade. They used to enjoy a comfortable life. Mrs Nonin used to have a well-paid job as a secretary in the federal meteorological service. She left her job eight years ago to look after her son, who had leukaemia. The boy died in 1994 after an unsuccessful bone-marrow transplant in Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides living through the hell of losing a son, Mrs Nonin remembers the nightmare of travelling abroad. With an air-traffic embargo in force, she had to travel with her son via Budapest. Obtaining an Italian visa for the trip was a story in itself. Western countries introduced visas for Yugoslav citizens in 1991 when the wars that accompanied the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia first broke out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet despite the scale of the discontent voiced by the ordinary people, there is no credible opposition to turn to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Alliance for Change started </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies just days after Nato air raids ended last June. Protests around the country were lively for more than a month, but fizzled out. Vuk Draskovic's Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO) decided not to join. Finally, in January, the biggest opposition parties joined forces but a proper unified </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not materialised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vladimir Goati, a political analyst, says the Serbian opposition &quot;is running around in circles&quot;. &quot;In the meantime, the remnants of civil society and independent media are paying a high price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some analysts believe the days of mass rallies against Mr Milosevic are over and that he could be removed from power only through free and fair elections. But fair elections have not been held in this country since 1990. Rigging elections is a speciality of the regime. Another is not recognising election results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the total isolation of the country is helping Mr Milosevic do whatever he wants. The regime has in fact divided its people into &quot;patriots&quot;, who support it, and &quot;traitors&quot;, those who sympathise with opposition parties. The opposition is accused of being &quot;the extended hand of the Nato aggressors&quot;, and of trying to instigate a civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is the regime itself that is preparing for further aggression, according to Slobodan Vucetic, one of the leading critics of Mr Milosevic. For years, Mr Vucetic was a supreme court judge who paid for his criticism of the regime when he was sacked last December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This regime lacks any rational approach when faced with economic and social meltdown,&quot; Mr Vucetic said. &quot;It is now in a great panic and will not hesitate to use force against its own people just to stay in power. This regime is nowhere near the democratisation that would offer the only solution to our crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And no matter what hardships people face, few analysts are predicting a revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I went to all the protests in Belgrade for years now: 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996...&quot; Mrs Nonin said. &quot;But I see that fewer and fewer people are willing to turn out... It's hard to understand their passivity. They live awful lives, yet they sit and wait for someone else to do something. Maybe it's fear, maybe they are cowards. I deplore that attitude, because if we do nothing, how can we expect things to change?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coalition hopes to oust Belgrade's strongman in coming elections</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hold your nose and vote for the opposition&quot; is the message that many Serbian civil rights activists are putting across to voters in the run-up to Yugoslavia's presidential elections on September 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to forget the opposition's futile divisions if we want to kick out Slobodan Milosevic as president of the Yugoslav Federation,&quot; says Otpor (Resistance), a militant student organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By putting his four-year term of office to the test of universal suffrage by changing the constitution last month (earlier, federation presidents had been elected by MPs), Belgrade's strongman has suddenly begun to look vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent observers agree that the key to the election will be the turn-out.  &quot;If a lot of people bother to vote, then the regime will have to rig the results massively to ensure victory for Milosevic, and in that case no one knows how the population will react,&quot; says Marko Blagojevic, head of the Centre for Free Elections and Democracy (Cesid).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every single ballot paper will count.  People have to be convinced that it will be their vote that tips the balance in favour of the democratic opposition candidate,&quot; says Blagojevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students of Otpor are the most zealous of the opposition campaigners.  For weeks they have been trying to motivate voters who have been turned off by the opposition's infighting, worn down by 10 years of economic crisis, traumatised by last year's Nato bombings, and brain-washed by official propaganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there has been no massive mobilisation against the regime.  &quot;No one expected Milosevic's constitutional coup on July 24 or, for that matter, September elections,&quot; says Dukasin Petrovic, one of the Otpor leaders.  &quot;The opposition is not ready, whereas the regime is already up and running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national media constantly hammer home the propaganda of Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) and of the ultranationalist Radical party, whose candidate is Tomislav Nikolic.  The Serbian prime minister, Mirko Marjanovic, sees the election as &quot;a referendum: are you in favour of Milosevic, development, peace and freedom, or do you want the country to be turned into a Western colony?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voja Janetic, a media expert, says: &quot;The regime is putting across a two-pronged message: we must resist foreign aggression and the new world order imposed by the United States.  The Serbs, behind Milosevic, are the defenders of the free world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition has opted for a minimal campaign.  &quot;People are fed up with politics.  Three weeks will be enough,&quot; says Vojislav Kostunica, the 56-year-old candidate of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), a coalition of 18 parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does this mean that the DOS does not really have its heart in its election campaign?  It claims that Milosevic is poised to break the rules that he has himself defined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As regards the general elections in Serbia and Montenegro, which will take place the same day as the Serbian local elections and the presidential election, the dice seem heavily loaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The federal general election is a foregone conclusion: it'll be won by the regime,&quot; says Predrag Simic, who works as an international relations adviser to Vuk Draskovic, president of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO), one of the main opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is why the opposition has been concentrating on the presidential election.  Opinion polls, though not very reliable, show that Kostunica is in with a chance.  After Draskovic sprang a surprise by withdrawing from the race, he was replaced as SPO candidate by Vojislav Mihajlovic, the colourless mayor of Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mihajlovic's many detractors claim that his only asset is his name -- his grandfather was Dragoslav Mihajlovic, leader of the Chetnik Serbian nationalist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the second world war, who was executed by Tito's partisans in 1946.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That view is shared by many in the SPO.  They suspect that Draskovic, whose popularity is on the wane, may have wanted to scupper the chances of an opposition victory by refusing to back a single opposition candidate.  While Kostunica may lack charisma, he does have a solid reputation for being a brilliant and honest intellectual who remains faithful to his ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are so fed up that any opposition candidate could beat Milosevic in the second round of a fair election,&quot; says one foreign observer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic could simply call off the election if the ratings are too disastrous for him in September; or he could rig the poll on a massive scale and bank on the population being too resigned to do anything; or there could be a re-run of the huge demonstrations of the winter of 1996-97, when the regime had to admit defeat in most large cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Milosevic loses the election, his coalition will still control the federal and Serbian parliaments as well as the Serbian presidency.  &quot;There's an odd atmosphere,&quot; says Milan Samardzic, an Otpor activist.  &quot;We tell ourselves that we have a chance of winning, while at the same time knowing full well that Milosevic can't lose.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">August 24</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A handful of black-robed, full-bearded Serb Orthodox priests bobbed on the edges of a noisy crowd that assembled last week in the Serb town of Cacak to demand that President Slobodan Milosevic resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of them, the Rev. Stojan Stokic, a village priest who had driven more than 150 miles for the rally, showed off the same pious fury, the same political passion that characterized many Roman Catholic priests in Poland who more than a decade ago helped the Solidarity </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> topple communism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To see and hear Stokic was to believe that something fundamental is changing in the soul of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which grabbed international attention last month by coming out ahead of Serb opposition parties and calling on Milosevic to step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Stokic, who said he would preach his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> politics in his parish, is still an exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Orthodox Church is both bound by and responsible for the notion that wherever Serbs live and bury their dead should be part of Serbia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the church that 10 years ago welcomed Milosevic's violent nationalist land grab in the collapsing Yugoslavia and whose most senior bishops travelled in the war zones of Croatia and Bosnia, blessing Serb forces shelling towns like Sarajevo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though its head, Patriarch Pavle, said last week in Kosovo that the Serb leader's policies are criminal, the church continues to send mixed signals about what its priests should do in toppling a president who is indicted as a war criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stokic said the war in Kosovo, where Serbs committed atrocities against Albanians before losing control of territory his church regards as sacred to Serbs, had changed everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am so ashamed and I am feeling guilty,&quot; he said. &quot;Milosevic never mentions that Albanians were killed. He is only president of the police. It isn't the job of the Orthodox Church to speak about politics. But now in this terrible time, we must speak out against this man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bishop Atanasije, vicar of the patriarchy in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, and a cleric who often speaks for Pavle, said in an interview: &quot;The church is not a political body. If the church has called for Slobodan Milosevic to resign, it is not because the church is involved in politics, it is out of her own pastoral care for the people of this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking pains to deny news stories that parish priests around Serbia have been instructed to use Sunday's services as the beginning of a campaign to teach Serbs about atrocities committed in their name in Kosovo, the bishop said, &quot;Those reports have nothing to do with reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is enough that the church hierarchy has spoken publicly, he said, adding that in local parishes, priests should stick to the Gospel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no need for the priests to speak out,&quot; said Atanasije, drawing a clear distinction between what the Serbian Orthodox Church is willing to do here and what the Catholic Church did in Poland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Roman Catholic Church is allowed to use any means in order to achieve a good goal,&quot; the bishop said. &quot;The Orthodox Church must always use evangelical means. We cannot say to the people rise up and throw off your government. We cannot use evil means to overcome evil. We can say obey the statutes of the law. That's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the decade during which Milosevic has been fomenting ethnic war in Yugoslavia, the Serbian Orthodox Church has frequently criticized him and called for his resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, shortly after the start of the Croatian war, Pavle accused Milosevic of making Serbs &quot;victims of communist tyranny&quot; and called for the creation of a government of national salvation. The patriarch in 1997 led a procession of more than 100,000 people into central Belgrade and lent his support to months of demonstrations during which opposition parties demanded that the president step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATROCITIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But until the patriarch began speaking recently of the &quot;evil&quot; he has seen in Kosovo, the focus of church criticism has not been that Milosevic's government committed atrocities in trying to create a new Serb empire, but that it has been unsuccessful in building that larger state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We blame Milosevic not for trying to defend the nation, but for failing,&quot; said Atanasije.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its recent statements about Kosovo, Atanasije said the church is not rethinking the support that many of its senior priests, including the patriarch himself, gave in blessing Bosnian Serb forces whose leaders have now been indicted for war crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One priest, the Rev. Filaret Micovic, photographed in Bosnia atop a tank while brandishing a Kalashnikov rifle, was recently promoted to bishop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't see anything strange about the presence of a priest among his troops,&quot; Atanasije said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This continuing stream of conflicting messages -- the embrace of nationalist aspirations but the rejection of Milosevic's savage means of realizing them -- grows out of the pivotal role that the church has played for nearly seven centuries in gestating and defending the idea of what it means to be a Serb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Being a Serb and being Orthodox mean the same thing,&quot; said Mirko Djordjevic, a retired literature professor and the author of a new book about the church and its ties to Milosevic. &quot;Our church itself has generated nationalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under centuries of Ottoman occupation, when the state of Serbia ceased to exist, it was the church and its myth-making senior clerics who kept the fires of Serb nationalism burning, and made honoured saints of Serb warriors. Prince Lazar, who led Serb forces against the Turks in the glorious lost battle of Kosovo in 1389, was reputed by the same church that made him a saint to have said: &quot;It is better to die in battle than to live in shame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hold on many Serbs of what the church has always described as a glorious national past has encouraged Serbs to hope for another Great Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In realizing the church's long-held dream that all Serbs should live in the same state, the rise of Milosevic in the late 1980s was the best news the Serbian Orthodox Church had heard for decades, Djordjevic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The church believed Milosevic was the messiah who had come to smile on all Serbs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in Bosnia, the bishops openly supported Radovan Karadzic, blessing his war to lop off part of that former Yugoslav republic and fuse it to Serbia. Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-1995 war, has been indicted for war crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After decades of Tito's communism, during which the church was repressed and controlled by the government and some of its vast properties were confiscated, Milosevic allowed the church to reclaim its role in Serb society. Priests appeared on state-controlled television. He pledged to allow religious education in schools and to return church property, promises later broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Christian holidays have again become public celebrations in Serbia and the church in 1989 was allowed to elect a patriarch, Pavle, who is from Kosovo, without government interference. As Yugoslavia unravelled and wars began in the early 1990s, Serb paramilitary leaders -- many of them responsible for atrocities and wholesale campaigns of theft in Croatia and Bosnia -- invoked the church as their inspiration for defending Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WAR CRIMINAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warlord Zeljko Raznjatovic, who is known as Arkan and has been indicted as a war criminal, said publicly that his &quot;supreme commander&quot; was Pavle. Before Arkan's indictment by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, but after worldwide publicity about the brutality and greed of his paramilitary fighters, Orthodox priests officiated at his lavish and very public wedding in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djordjevic, regarded as a leading expert on the Serbian church, says Pavle has been &quot;shocked&quot; by the evidence of atrocities that he has seen in Kosovo since the 11-week war with NATO ended in early June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That shock has resulted in what Djordjevic describes as a new direction for the church, with the patriarch and Bishop Artemije, the most senior representative of the church in Kosovo, speaking openly of &quot;evil&quot; done by Serbs against Albanians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artemije took part Friday in a U.N.-sponsored meeting with the leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Hashim Thaci, and other Albanian leaders. They signed a joint statement condemning war crimes and crimes against humanity committed against Albanians in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artemije has long opposed Milosevic but has not often been heard inside Yugoslavia. Shortly after the NATO bombing began, he made a proclamation to be read in every church in Kosovo, criticizing what he called &quot;pogroms&quot; against the Albanians. It condemned the burning of houses and attacking of people.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a million refugees and a devastated Kosovo, the argument will not die away quickly. We need to look with scepticism on the conclusion that Nato has achieved a 'victory&quot;. It might be illuminating for Simon Hoggart (June 9) to comment on his conclusions in six months' time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What the bombing has achieved has been a rapid acceleration of existing horrors - and the UK has a particular responsibility, given the single-minded belligerence of its prime minister. Was there an alternative? Certainly not an easy, bloodless answer to Milosevic's brutalities. Milosevic could only have been restrained, at best and only in part, by world opinion backed by various economic and political sanctions (UN agreed), and by the encouragement of the extensive </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sentiment inside Serbia. Milosevic's evil practices would not have ended, but with aid workers, UN observers and journalists in Kosovo, the atrocities might have been restrained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a melancholy conclusion, for the world is rum bling with wars and the threats of war. More violence is usually not the answer. Prof John Saville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University of Hull</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Henry Porter (G2, June 9) is right to attack the anti-war </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the poverty of its arguments and its refusal to support the Kosovans. But he is wrong to assert that this is part of a collapse of the left. There were many on the socialist left who focused on the central issue, the attempt to wipe out the Kosovans as a people. We tried to ensure that practical support and solidarity was delivered through campaigns like Workers Aid for Kosova and Trade Unions for Kosova. This work will not stop because the immediate war may have ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also insisted on the right of Kosovo to independence, something supported by neither Nato nor the crude 'anti-imperialists'. Will Nato now support the right of Kosovo to self-determination or wind up at war with the KLA? Whatever they do it will certainly be determined by the interests of the western ruling class. But it was possible to give support to the Kosavans without putting any trust or confidence in Nato. Patrick Murphy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alliance for Workers Liberty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No Serbs have been so effectively silenced, politically neutered, disenfranchised, as those of us who have opposed the Nato aggression. We have had no means of dissenting through the democratic process. Parliament was not allowed to determine whether we should go to war or how to end it. Those few courageous MPs who opposed the bombing were not permitted to test the feeling of either the parliamentary Labour party or parliament through votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is it not gratuitous to condemn Milosevic for acting as a dictator when, in Britain, a cabal of politicians can implicate all of us in an unwarranted act of carnage without our consent? Prof Vic Allen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Keighley, W Yorks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You will be surprised to know, judging from your letter writers, that all the frontline states of Albania, Bosnia/Hercegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, FYR Macedonia, Romania, and Slovenia fully support Nato strategy. The ranks of the retired military, diplomats and politicians, the professional leftists and, heaven help us, thespians and playwrights who questioned the continuing prosecution of Nato's aims would do well to dwell on the view of those closest to the conflict. They believe it would certainly have created a far worse situation than we presently face and we should not weaken in our resolve to see it through to the end. Peter Robinson</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A handful of black-robed, full-bearded Serbian Orthodox priests bobbed on the edges of a noisy crowd that assembled this week in the Serbian town of Cacak to demand that President Slobodan Milosevic resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of them, Father Stojan Stokic, a village priest who had driven more than 150 miles for the rally, showed off the same pious fury, the same political passion that characterized many Roman Catholic priests in Poland who more than a decade ago helped the Solidarity </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> topple Communism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To see and hear Father Stojan was to believe that something fundamental is changing in the soul of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which grabbed international attention last month by coming out ahead of Serbian opposition parties and calling on Mr. Milosevic to step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Father Stojan, who said he will preach his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> politics in his parish this Sunday morning, is still an exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Orthodox Church is both bound by and responsible for the notion that wherever Serbs live and bury their dead should be part of Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the church that 10 years ago welcomed Mr. Milosevic's violent nationalist land grab in the collapsing Yugoslavia, the church whose most senior bishops traveled in the war zones of Croatia and Bosnia, blessing Serbian forces shelling towns like Sarajevo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though its head, Patriarch Pavle, said this week in Kosovo that the Serbian leader's policies are criminal, the church continues to send mixed signals about what its priests should do about toppling a President who is indicted as a war criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Stojan said the war in Kosovo, where Serbs committed atrocities against Albanians before losing control of territory his church regards as sacred to Serbs, has changed everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am so ashamed and I am feeling guilty,&quot; he said. &quot;Milosevic never mentions that Albanians were killed. He is only president of the police. It isn't the job of the Orthodox Church to speak about politics. But now in this terrible time, we must speak out against this man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bishop Atanasije, vicar of the patriarchy in Belgrade and a cleric who often speaks for Patriarch Pavle, said in an interview: &quot;The church is not a political body.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Roman Catholic Church is allowed to use any means in order to achieve a good goal,&quot; the bishop said. &quot;The Orthodox Church must always use evangelical means. We cannot say to the people rise up and throw off your Government. We cannot use evil means to overcome evil. We can say obey the statutes of the law. That's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the decade during which Mr. Milosevic has been fomenting ethnic war in Yugoslavia, the Serbian Orthodox Church has frequently criticized him and called for his resignation.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Christian holidays have again become public celebrations in Serbia and the church in 1989 was allowed to elect a patriarch, Pavle, who is from Kosovo, without Government interference. As Yugoslavia unraveled and wars began in the early 1990's, Serbian paramilitary leaders -- many of them responsible for atrocities and wholesale campaigns of theft in Croatia and Bosnia -- invoked the church as their inspiration for defending Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warlord Zeljko Raznjatovic, who is known as Arkan and has been indicted as a war criminal, said publicly that his &quot;supreme commander&quot; was Patriarch Pavle. Before Arkan's indictment by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague but after worldwide publicity about the brutality and greed of his paramilitary fighters, Orthodox priests officiated at his lavish and very public wedding in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djordjevic, regarded as a leading expert on the Serbian Church, says Patriarch Pavle has been &quot;shocked&quot; by the evidence of atrocities that he has seen in Kosovo since the 11-week war with NATO ended in early June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That shock has resulted in what Mr. Djordjevic describes as a new direction for the Serbian Church, with the Patriarch and Bishop Artemije, the most senior representative of the church in Kosovo, speaking openly of &quot;evil&quot; done by Serbs against Albanians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Artemije took part on Friday in a United Nations-sponsored meeting with the leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Hashim Thaci, and other Albanian leaders. They signed a joint statement condemning war crimes and crimes against humanity committed against Albanians in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Artemije has long opposed Mr. Milosevic but has not often been heard inside Serbia. Shortly after the NATO bombing began, he made a proclamation to be read in every church in Kosovo, criticizing what he called &quot;pogroms&quot; against the Albanians. It condemned the burning of houses and attacking of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We read it in our church,&quot; said Father Sava, an assistant to Bishop Artemije and one of the most outspoken liberal priests in the church. Father Sava admitted that many priests may have chosen not to follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was brave, because of the secret police,&quot; the priest said. &quot;And you know we have no free media. Bishop Artemije was then attacked by Serbian state media and called a madman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Orthodox Church is not a monolith, he explained, and priests do not have to obey the Patriarch, as members of the Roman Catholic Church have to obey the Pope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not unified,&quot; Father Sava said. &quot;People can have their own political understanding. There are a lot of deluded people in the church as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Belgrade on Friday, Bishop Atanasije insisted on steering an interview away from the matter of the church's new openness about atrocities committed by Serbs and toward what he described as foreigners' refusal to give equal time to the abuse of Serbs by other ethnic groups across Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Westerners tend to close their eyes when the suffering of Serbs is concerned,&quot; the bishop said, emphasizing an abiding tradition in the Orthodox Church that sees Serbs as victims of foreign manipulation. &quot;What was done in Kosovo, of course, was evil. But the next question that has to be asked is who committed evil. The Serbs were not the only actors.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">http://www.nytimes.com</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weary of political infighting and unsure of which reformist faction to support, more than half the Serbian electorate did not vote in Sunday's presidential election, rendering the result invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under legislation dating from Slobodan Milosevic's autocratic rule in the 1990s, if less than 50 per cent of the voters turn out, the election must be held again within two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just 45.4 per cent ventured into rain to cast ballots Sunday, ignoring warnings from both presidential candidates that a failed election would only drag out the political instability that is holding back Serbia's economic recovery.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbia's current president, Milan Milutinovic, has been indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague, where Milosevic is on trial, and is widely expected to surrender once his term expires at the end of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preliminary results from the vote showed Vojislav Kostunica, a conservative nationalist who replaced Milosevic as president of Yugoslavia, easily defeated Miroljub Labus, a pro-western liberal and architect of the government's economic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica, who is seeking a new job before the Yugoslav federation grouping Serbia and Montenegro is abolished, won 66.7 per cent of the vote against 31.3 per cent for Labus, according to Belgrade's Centre for Free Elections and Democracy, which monitored the ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both are veterans of the disparate alliance of reformers that ousted Milosevic two years ago, but they represent two rival factions that quickly emerged from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bitter power struggle between the two camps -- one led by Kostunica, the other by the Serbian prime minister, Zoran Djindjic -- has brought reforms to a standstill and alienated voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Serbs are tired of political squabbling,&quot; said Jovan Maric, a psychiatrist and prominent commentator on social issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have sent a signal to the government that it needs to do something dramatic to make people's lives better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many observers fear politicians will now devote their attention to electioneering rather than the economic and political reforms Serbia needs to recover from a decade of wars, isolation and impoverishment under Milosevic. But if the campaign is as contentious as this one, it could prove just as difficult to motivate the electorate in two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People don't see anything to vote for and neither candidate gave them much of an incentive,&quot; one western diplomat said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After Labus lost the first round, there were only two conceivable outcomes in the runoff -- a Kostunica victory and a failed election. Both just mean further political uncertainty.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbian opposition leaders Thursday called on President Slobodan Milosevic to resign after he said he would do just that if the United Nations ended the economic blockade of his republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with a British television company, Milosevic said Wednesday he would &quot;absolutely&quot; resign if it would end sanctions imposed last weekend to punish Serbia for perceived aggression in the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really don't know whether he said it seriously,&quot; said Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but it is clear &quot;Serbia's salvation depends on his resignation.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vojislav Kostunica, vice-president of the Democratic Party, agreed Milosevic's resignation would hasten the end of the war in Bosnia and lead to greater democracy in Serbia. But he said &quot;it is not a serious offer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others questioned whether Milosevic's resignation -- real or not -- would achieve an end to the sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a good trick,&quot; said Jurij Bajec, a former close associate and now critic of Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the sanctions could not be lifted just because he resigned because then the world would admit that they really wanted to get rid of him and not to end the war in Bosnia,&quot; Bajec said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Serbs of all political persuasions said innocent people would soon be paying a high price for measures that would have no effect on Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sanctions include a trade and oil embargo and a ban on flights in and out of Yugoslavia, comprising only Serbia and tiny Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has admitted Milosevic has limited influence over Serbian irregulars fighting Muslims and Croats in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can bet Milosevic is doing everything he can to end the war in Bosnia because his own head is on the line now,&quot; said Bajec.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica, from the Democratic Party, said Milosevic is being bombarded by international and domestic calls for his resignation. In an extraordinary move, the Serbian Orthodox church last week called on him to step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This must represent a serious psychological problem for Milosevic,&quot; said Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, many Serbs said the West's intense opposition to Milosevic may even strengthen his position by rallying compatriots to his side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All these rumors about military intervention are bringing us closer to unification because we are an irrational, emotional people,&quot; said Danko Djunic, managing director of the independent Economics Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition leaders could only rally about 35,000 people in Belgrade, a city of approximately 1.7 million, for an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To say we are frustrated is an understatement,&quot; admitted Milan Komnenic, vice-president of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was speaking of the opposition's failure to mould widespread dissatisfaction with the Serbian economic and political situation into a force that could topple Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic, a former Communist leader, was democratically elected in December 1990 as a socialist.</SPAN></P>

They have sent a signal to the government that it needs to do something dramatic to make people's lives better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the state broadcaster RTS and a couple of small independent channels, television networks did not broadcast special election programs Sunday night, reflecting a widespread lack of interest in the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many observers fear that politicians will now devote their attention to electioneering rather than the reforms Serbia needs to recover from a decade of wars, international isolation and impoverishment under Milosevic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Labus said he had not yet decided whether to run again, he is unlikely to have Djindjic's backing after Sunday's result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica, who is Serbia's most popular politician, is demanding that a general election be held as soon as possible in the hope of gaining control of Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Serbian president, he would be better placed to persuade some of the 17 parties in Djindjic's coalition to join his camp and rob the government of its majority. Political survival for Djindjic, who is personally unpopular with voters, largely depends on his ability to thwart Kostunica's ambitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless these two men can reconcile their differences or one of them wins, their power struggle will continue to dictate post-Milosevic politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem with our politicians is vanity,&quot; said Radmilo Kljajic, a columnist for Serbia's leading daily newspaper, Politika.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Father Sava Janjic is one of the bravest Serbs left in Kosovo. A soft-spoken figure whose scholarly appearance masks passionately held views, his rare quality is his willingness to acknowledge the crimes done to Albanians by the Milosevic regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet as sits in the high-ceilinged refectory of the monastery of Gracanica, he has little to feel cheerful about. A leader of the Serb National Council in Kosovo, he became the articulate voice of those Serbs who felt they should cooperate with the United Nations administration when it arrived in the territory in June.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now he feels let down and under pressure. Kfor, the international peace force, is failing to protect Serbs enough to give them freedom of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> beyond their prison enclaves, let alone create conditions for those who left Kosovo to want to come home. In the northern city of Mitrovice which has been effectively partitioned, pro-Milosevic Serbs boast that their success in keeping Albanians out shows a tough line is the only solution. Father Sava senses Slobodan Milosevic's support in Kosovo is growing and that the hard -liners who denounce Kfor as nothing more than an occupation force are gaining strength. The trouble in Mitrovice is not just a battle between Serbs and Albanians but a struggle for the allegiance of Kosovo's Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amid his many disappointments Father Sava's regrets the lack of support which he and his boss, Bishop Artemije, Kosovo's senior Orthodox clergyman, have had from opposition politicians in Belgrade. At a recent meeting, the two clerics asked the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> politicians to sign a joint declaration which would stress two points. First, that it was not an act of treason for Kosovo's Serbs to work with the United Nations. Second, that 'injustices' had been inflicted on Albanians. Although this was deliberately softer than the clergymen's usual formulation 'crimes', even this was too much for Belgrade's opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Had it been signed, the statement would have had far-ranging political benefits. Father Sava and Bishop Artemije are convinced that unless more Serbs acknowledge that the atrocities done in their name are the prime cause of the hatred which bedevils Kosovo today, tolerance will take a long time to grow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is easy to see that Serbs cannot readily accept that their side bears the greater guilt. What is more depressing is the way this escape from the facts is beginning to creep into western public discourse on Kosovo's shaky peace. Allan Little's recent BBC2 programme, Moral Combat, was only the latest example of the tendency to say a plague on both houses - with the danger that the international community will wash its hands and withdraw from Kosovo, as Milosevic is no doubt calculating. Little produced an excellent discussion of the conflict among western politicians and military strategists over the conduct of the war, but he put it into a surprisingly one-dimensional framework which gave no political context beyond the tendentious claim that from the very beginning the Kosovo Liberation Army aimed at provoking a Nato intervention. If that was so, how come the KLA's man at Rambouillet did most to anger the Americans and endanger the talks? And what happened to the consensus among all who reported on Kosovo in 1998, including Allan Little, that the KLA was one of the least centralised and disparate guerrilla </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of recent times, with minimal overall leadership and no clear strategy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The notion of 'balance', in which a suffering Albanian family is juxtaposed with a suffering Serb family, culminated in the programme's final line that 'the oppressed, now liberated, have become the oppressors', which created a false moral and historical equivalence. Is there really no difference between a state-machine whose security forces use arson, artillery, and cold-blooded murder on a mass scale against people still in their homes, and the hot -blooded revenge-seeking of bereaved people returning to destroyed villages and burning the houses of their Serb neighbours, usually after the Serbs had already left?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now we have moved to a second post-war stage, where crime in Kosovo is random, opportunistic, urban and largely done by professional criminals who want to make money out of Serb flats rather than by former refugees in the countryside. It is the inevitable consequence of a law and order vacuum, for which the international community is mainly to blame for failing to provide the police it promised. Take away the police from London or Berlin, and see how quickly the crime rate would soar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is not to deny that the current violence against Serbs in Kosovo takes place in a vindictive atmosphere where most Albanians, regrettably, think ethnically. Moderate Albanian opinion keeps quiet and witnesses to repression do not come forward. Far from restraining them, parents encourage their children to stone Serb buses when they pass through Albanian areas under Kfor escort. The Albanian press does not feel able or willing to report fairly, let alone critically, on what is being done to Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is where Father Sava comes back in. Albanians would start to differentiate and not lump all Serbs together as evil-doers if they felt more Serbs were able to accept the truth about what happened in 1998 and 1999, and even show some sense of collective responsibility. Albanians would also relax if more Serbs did not go on behaving, as those in Mitrovice do, as though the Serbs can still win the war and get Kfor to withdraw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For western governments the message is clear. The ambiguity of UN resolution 1244 which left Kosovo's final status obscure has become a liability. It gives false encouragement to Serbs and real anxiety to Albanians. What is needed is a forthright statement by the western powers, and preferably the security council as a whole, that Kosovo will never return to Serb rule. This would help the cowardly opposition in Belgrade to break free of the nationalist cancer. They could correctly argue that it was Milosevic who lost Kosovo, and then go on to develop a modern political and economic agenda no longer distorted by territorial self-delusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Albanians such a declaration would provide a reason to stop seeing every Serb in Kosovo as a potential fifth columnist. In exchange for an international commitment that Kosovo's return to Serb rule is off the table for ever, the leaders of the various Kosovo Albanian parties should be urged to agree to a formal statement that the territory will remain legally part of Yugoslavia, though under international protection, for three or five more years. In that period Milosevic might finally leave power or Yugoslavia, with the help of Montenegro, might dissolve - leaving Kosovo independent by default.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are hard choices ahead for Serbs, Albanians, and the international community, but to trivialise Kosovo's current troubles as an endless Balkan cycle of violence does no service to anyone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputies loyal to President Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, unexpectedly agreed to consider opposition demands for early elections legislation. But the lawmakers also moved to take over Serbian municipalities governed by the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some wounded demonstrators were left lying motionless on the pavement. Others fled, shouting: ''Slobodan to The Hague!'' referring to the UN tribunal that has charged Mr. Milosevic with war crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official Serbian television station accused the students of provoking the crackdown, and showed footage of the demonstrators throwing objects at police. It said the police action was justified and professional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The student organization Otpor, or Resistance, told the Beta news agency that 50 people were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In parliament, which is dominated by Mr. Milosevic's allies, the deputies' offer to discuss early general elections provided no guarantee that the elections would be approved. Elections are scheduled for the end of 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A decision by the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the largest opposition party, to walk out of the legislature further diminished chances of such an agreement between Mr. Milosevic's neo-communists and ultranationalists. The parliament decided to discuss the matter today.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROKUPLJE, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters demanding the resignation of Slobodan Milosevic stoned his party's headquarters here yesterday after a supporter of the Yugoslav president fired gunshots into the air to disrupt the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A scheduled counter-demonstration by government supporters failed to materialize, and police did not interfere with the rally by about 4,000 demonstrators, the latest in a series of protests that have seen tens of thousands of people out in the streets demanding that Milosevic step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We will chase him out, '' said Goran Svilanovic, a top figure in the Alliance for Change, an umbrella group of opposition parties that organized the rally and other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti- Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition parties are trying to capitalize on the growing discontent among Serbs against Milosevic over the loss of historic Kosovo province after a widely destructive 78-day bombing campaign by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They put shame on us, killing and burning in our name,'' Svilanovic said, referring to atrocities committed by Milosevic's forces against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historian Milan Protic, another Alliance activist, said: ''Too much evil has been done for them to be forgiven. It is too little to just demand that they leave. We must make them leave.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the planned counter-demonstration, only about two dozen Milosevic supporters, mostly elderly, showed up and traded insults with the protesters in Prokuplje, a town of about 20,000 about 190 kilometres south of Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One protester was slightly injured in a shoving match with government supporters. Some of the counter-demonstrators hung a banner on a nearby roof calling the protesters ''traitors.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Milosevic supporter came out of an office of the ruling Socialist Party and fired several gunshots into the air. No one was injured, but protesters began to throw stones at the building until their leaders appealed for calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police did not intervene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With memories of the NATO bombing still fresh, Milosevic has sought to portray his opponents as traitors and pawns in a Western plot to destabilize Yugoslavia. The accusations, pushed by state-run media, have made it difficult for opposition parties to advocate Western-style democracy and reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, the Socialist Party blasted the top </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leader and head of the Democratic Party, Zoran Djindjic, as ''an unofficial spokesman for NATO and Albanian separatists.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic, who has visited NATO countries recently to drum up support, returned to Yugoslavia last week despite a military court's decision to investigate him on allegations that he dodged military service during the Kosovo conflict. Serbia's state-run media have branded him a traitor who sided with NATO and Albanian separatists in Kosovo, Serbia's southern province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic and other Milosevic opponents have been emboldened by the size and spontaneity of recent protests in several Serbian cities. Djindjic has said daily demonstrations could build a broad enough base for a general strike aimed at ousting Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic spent part of yesterday in Kosovo, seeking the support of Serbian Orthodox Church leaders and meeting with Western officials involved in the peacekeeping operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he got a hostile reception from Serbs in Gracanica, a village near Pristina, the province's capital. The crowd chanted pro-Milosevic slogans, shouted that Djindjic and his colleagues were ''thieves'' and kicked and pushed journalists and camera operators covering the disturbance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters ''were sent to make trouble, by Milosevic, of course,'' Djindjic said after the riot was put down by soldiers attached to NATO's peace-implementation force. ''It was a joke by Milosevic - one of his last jokes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbia's Orthodox Church, already the source of outspoken attacks on Milosevic, formally added its weight to the Alliance campaign. Bishop Vladika Artemije of Raska and Prizren and the Alliance set out their common aims in a statement after yesterday's meeting. ''We jointly declare that the only way toward the salvation of Serbia and of Kosovo and Metohija (the Serb designation for the province) is in the urgent and thorough transformation of Serbia into a democratic country,'' the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic, a former mayor of Belgrade whose fluency in foreign languages has made him a focal point of the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for international media, said he hopes Serbs in Kosovo will realize that ditching Milosevic would help them live in safety and peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Some problems in Kosovo cannot be solved if Serbia does not become democratic. Only with a democratic Serbia can Serbs remain in Kosovo,'' Djindjic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the month since NATO's occupation of Kosovo, demonstrations and anti-government rallies have erupted across Serbia.  The northern Serb city of Novi Sad, battered during NATO's air war, has been the scene of incessant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests and marches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The common folk are not the only ones who have caught the virus. Even more devastating to Milosevic's political future has been the participation of Yugoslav army soldiers in protest rallies and a recent insurrection by reporters and editors in the state's media machine over the government's determination to set news policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">SARAJEVO, Bosnia, June 14, 1992</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After weeks of frustration and failure in international efforts to break the siege of Sarajevo, the commander of the U.N. peace-keeping mission said here today that he now is receiving tangible cooperation from Serb forces who surround the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have confirmed that the Serbian leaders are committed to opening the airport. Things are moving in the right direction,&quot; said Brig. Gen. Lew MacKenzie, the Canadian commander of the U.N. peace-keeping operation here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most immediate threat to opening the airport and lifting the siege now appears to be coming not from Serb forces, but from the primarily Muslim defenders of the city.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have mounted a major offensive, using artillery and infantry, to reclaim a downtown neighborhood called Grbavica. At the cost of many casualties, the Muslims appear to have surrounded and sealed off a Serb fighting unit in the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two sides separately signed a new cease-fire, to go into effect at 6 a.m. Monday, that will test whether the Muslim side is prepared to give up its relative advantage in Grbavica for the sake of opening the airport and feeding the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be a great tragedy if they continue the offensive,&quot; said MacKenzie. He said a cease-fire will have to hold before more U.N. forces are brought into Sarajevo, the airport is opened and food can reach hungry people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a spectacular Saturday night of rocket attacks and street fighting near the city center, there was a noticeable decline today in fighting in and around Sarajevo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serb fighters allowed U.N. technicians access to Sarajevo airport, where they began assessing how quickly it can be opened to international relief flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The blockade will be lifted in four days,&quot; a banner headline in the Sarajevo daily newspaper Oslobodzenje announced. But MacKenzie said in an interview that if &quot;everything goes right&quot; it will take at least eight or nine days to open the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the news lifted spirits in a city short of food, water, electricity and hope. A few cafes opened to eager customers, and many residents defied sporadic sniper fire to walk the streets in search of food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 50,000 tons of relief food and medical supplies are waiting at nearby Zagreb airport for an airlift to relieve the food shortage. The capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been under siege by the Serbs for 10 weeks. In several sealed-off neighborhoods, residents are believed to be starving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About five tons of food and medicine arrived in Sarajevo by road on Saturday night, with another 95 tons of French aid waiting 30 miles outside Sarajevo for Serbian clearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.N. officers held meetings today with Serb commanders on the removal of antiaircraft guns and missile systems to a distance of at least six miles from the airport. Serb and Bosnian leaders signed a deal nine days ago that commits them to giving the United Nations sole control of Sarajevo airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meetings were also held this weekend on a plan for both the Serb and Bosnian sides to move their artillery into locations where they can be monitored by the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We discussed the concentration of the guns. The term 'goodwill' has to be used,&quot; said MacKenzie, who met on Saturday for two hours with the political leader of Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, and the commander of most Serb military units in Bosnia, Gen. Ratko Mladic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another signal that the Serbs may be changing what had been an overtly hostile attitude toward U.N. peace keepers, a captain was sent this weekend as a liaison officer to live in the U.N. mission headquarters in Sarajevo. In turn, two U.N. officers were sent as live-in observers to the main Serb military barracks on the edge of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.N. sources said the level of Serb cooperation here is a result of mounting international and domestic pressure on the Belgrade regime of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic, despite his repeated denials, is said by Western governments to have been responsible for starting the ethnic war in Bosnia, and he is thought to exercise considerable control over Serb fighters here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Belgrade, the Serbian capital, Milosevic's problems are growing daily. U.N. economic sanctions against Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, imposed two weeks ago, are gutting the economy. Big state-owned factories have been idled, foreign companies such as the McDonald's fast-food chain are closing, and superhighways have emptied. Gasoline, spare parts and some basic foods are short, and hyper-inflation has made it difficult for many pensioners to afford food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Serbia's fractious domestic political opposition has united under an umbrella group that is calling for Milosevic's immediate resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Street demonstrations in Belgrade today drew thousands of people, who marched on the Serbian assembly and on Milosevic's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the pillars of the once-docile Serbian establishment have been drawn into the dump-Milosevic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They include a circle of senior Serbian writers and academics, as well as the Serbian Orthodox Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exiled head of a Serbian royal family, Crown Prince Michael, also has joined the opposition. His appeal to Serbian traditionalists is being used by the umbrella group to siphon off Milosevic's appeal to nationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbian Patriarch Pavle, the normally nonpolitical leader of the Orthodox Church, led one of today's demonstrations. He warned that Serbia faces civil war unless the government surrenders power quickly. &quot;Our greatest enemy is domestic Serbian evil,&quot; he told the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations came despite threats from radical Serbian nationalist groups to use force to stop street demonstrations. Milosevic's regime has backed a number of criminals who lead paramilitary groups that fought in Bosnia and in the former Yugoslav republic of Croatia. The return of many of these fighters to Belgrade has sparked widespread fear among Western governments that murder and assassinations could be used to stop the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. government on Saturday ordered all American citizens to leave Serbia and its small ally Montenegro. It also announced a sharp reduction in staff at its embassy in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beforehand, many suggested that it would not happen or, if it did, that it would not amount to much. But, in the end, Wednesday's opposition rally in Belgrade, to demand the resignation of President Milosevic of Yugoslavia, turned out to be a night to remember. The crowd of up to 100,000 people that assembled outside the Federal Parliament building was the largest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gathering since before Nato's air war for Kosovo. Although he had said earlier that he would not bother to attend, the charismatic Vuk Draskovic, leader of the largest opposition party and hero of earlier mass protest rallies in 1996, did after all turn up at the last minute, drawing criticism from the government-controlled television network that he was &quot;fulfilling a promise&quot; to the hated United States. Support for the protest came from abroad, too, in the shape of a message from the London-based Prince Alexander Karadjordjevic, pretender to the Serbian throne, urging opposition parties to keep out of any coalition with Mr Milosevic. Seen inside and outside Serbia as a barometer of the public's attitude to Milosevic - after his disastrous policy in the southern province of Kosovo which triggered the Nato bombing campaign - there are elements of both bad and good news in the outcome of the rally.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bad news is the publicly voiced discord that keeps opposition leaders at each other's throat rather than working towards the same goals. Zoran Djindjic, who heads the Democratic Party, demanded, to cheers from the crowd, that Mr Milosevic and his Government resign within 15 days or face mass protests. The Serbian Orthodox Church and Group 17, an alliance of economists and technocrats, want a transitional government of experts to rule for a year, after Mr Milosevic resigns and before new elections can be held. But, when the bearded Mr Draskovic - a bitter personal rival of Mr Djindjic - made his dramatic appearance, he poured cold water on these plans. His competing agenda was less radical: moving forward elections due next year to November. The same suggestion had already been made this week by Mr Milosevic's aides; moreover, the mercurial Mr Draskovic, who had moved briefly from opposition to government before being sacked in April for speaking out against the war, is viewed in some quarters as an opportunist. The jeers of &quot;traitor!&quot; that greeted his proposal may, therefore, have indicated no more than suspicion about whether he could be moving back into the Government's orbit; they may, however, suggest a darker truth. Some opposition members turned against Mr Milosevic simply because he lost Kosovo, the terrain they called the Serb heartland, and not because of the atrocities perpetrated there in the name of his twisted brand of nationalism; the hostile reception given to Mr Draskovic raises worrying questions about how far even Serb opposition activists still are from confronting the hard truths they will need to learn if they are to fashion a real democracy. More immediately, the clash also left unclear where the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> divided leadership can take it next. Even the next rally date was in dispute: Group 17 wanted September 21, Mr Djindjic August 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet the sheer size and energy of the turnout gives reason for hope that Mr Milosevic's grip on Serbia is, at last, weakening. Organisers had been scared of calling protesters out in sophisticated but weary Belgrade, whose people had learnt the hard way in 1996 that mass rallies, however enthusiastic, can fail to produce political change. Yet hope triumphed over experience, and tens of thousands turned out again. Despite the weakness of the Opposition's split leadership, there is real strength in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> grassroots.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It arrived at a city museum in a silver van and will lie in state on a red carpet until the end of today, against the wishes of the director of the museum, built to honour another Yugoslav leader, Tito.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have turned my museum into a funeral parlour,'' said the director, Ljiljana Cetinic. &quot;I most strongly protest as a director and a citizen of this country,'' she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vocal opposition to Milosevic's welcome home, especially from those who consider him a traitor and his return an embarrassment, grew in volume. But a stream of mainly elderly people visited the closed coffin, bowing their heads at the remains of their former hero or kissing his portrait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside those waiting in the snow clutched flowers and candles and denounced as &quot;murderers'' his United Nations jailers in The Hague, where he died last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rally protesting against the funeral in Milosevic's birthplace, Pozarevac, tomorrow will take place at the same time in Belgrade. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaigners, including those who aided his overthrow in 2000, issued invitations to a &quot;springtime is early'' demonstration by text message.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a difficult job and will take a decade, but unless we do it there will be no guarantee that another person like Milosevic will not take his place.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbia's most powerful opposition figure brought tens of thousands of frustrated citizens into the streets of this economically shattered city tonight in the largest protest thus far against the continued rule of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic -- the charismatic leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which sponsored the rally -- used the occasion to demonstrate his latest strategy for toppling the Milosevic government. Instead of trying to arouse the crowd with rhetoric about sending Milosevic to face an international tribunal on war crimes charges, Draskovic declared that the opposition should say &quot;no to revenge&quot; and added: &quot;I will personally guarantee that Milosevic does not go to jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new tactic could be a dicey one. Many Serbs would like to see Milosevic pay for the misery and global isolation he has brought them through four losing wars, but at least as many fear the internal strife this could cause -- not to mention the national shame of seeing their leader tried in a U.N.-sponsored court most view as rigged against them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Serbia has to avoid the danger of a civil war,&quot; Draskovic said, warning that there are &quot;forces in favor of civil war&quot; in which Serb would fight against Serb and provide just the kind of excuse for &quot;NATO troops [to] come in&quot; -- as they have in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic, a bearded populist who spent four months in prison for his attacks on the Milosevic government in the early 1990s, now appears to be reaching out to some members of the government to assure them that while Milosevic must go, some of them can hold on to their positions and perks. In effect, he appears to be trying to create an opportunity for Milosevic to step down with dignity and as little chaos as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to get out of this big disaster as peacefully as possible,&quot; Draskovic told the cheering crowd. To do this, he declared, sloganeering and demonstrations are not enough. Serbs do not need to shout at each other, he said, but to listen quietly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizational power of Draskovic and his party, which controls the Belgrade city government, was in evidence here at the first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally he has called since the end of the Kosovo conflict -- the latest military debacle for the Serbs in 10 years of Milosevic-instigated wars among the ruins of the old Yugoslav federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been a number of other protest rallies around Serbia in the last two weeks, organized by smaller opposition parties and ad hoc groups, but they paled in comparison with the sophistication of the show put on by Draskovic -- who called himself the &quot;czar of the streets&quot; earlier in the decade, when he led hundreds of thousands of people in protests against government manipulation of election returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's rally looked like a rock concert. A large stage was erected near the central square, complete with theatrical lighting and towering sound speakers that blasted out music loud enough to induce a headache. Then, triumphantly, Draskovic arrived amid a small contingent of supporters and bodyguards who parted the crowd as they escorted the opposition leader to the stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hard to estimate the exact size of crowds at Serbian rallies. Police do not give numbers, and organizers often exaggerate attendance. Draskovic's party controls a Belgrade television station called Studio B, which reported that 50,000 people attended. That seemed a little high to foreign observers, who estimated the crowd at about half that number -- which still made it the largest postwar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally thus far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Draskovic and his new message will resonate with the exhausted and economically ruined residents of this central Serbian city of 200,000 remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kragujevac is a dying city,&quot; sighed Ratko Jovanovic, a municipal employee who is helping coordinate the massive influx of displaced Serbs here from war-ravaged Kosovo. The large industrial plants in the city's Zastava Complex, which made Yugo cars as well as trucks, spare parts and munitions, was hit hard by NATO bombs. Jovanovic estimates that 60,000 citizens here are out of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only facilities still operating in Kragujevac produce milk, meat, canned goods and alcohol. &quot;Everything else is dead,&quot; Jovanovic said. He said the city's heating plants must be rebuilt to keep people from freezing this winter but that there is no money available; the city budget is 5 percent of what it was a decade ago. Mostly, Jovanovic said, &quot;we need food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic told the crowd that what this war-weary land needs now is to create a transitional government in Belgrade composed of respected experts, then to seek an immediate end of international economic sanctions and a massive infusion of foreign aid and investment -- something the United States and other NATO countries have said they oppose so long as Milosevic remains in power. Draskovic also called for a return to Kosovo of the tens of thousands of Serbs who fled the province after the war and for speedy national elections conducted to European standards of fairness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoran Spasic and his wife Vesna stood in the crowd with their 5-year-old daughter. Vesna Spasic is an unemployed lawyer; her husband is a salesman selling off the remaining spare parts from the Zastava Complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many Serbs, the Spasics said they just want to see an end to the Milosevic regime and the beginning of something positive, something that would help their people emerge from the ruin and waste of the last decade and reintegrate them into Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what they would do if they had to choose between violent change and no change at all, Zoran Spasic thought for a moment and asked: &quot;Can we have change without violence?&quot; His wife said, &quot;We have had wars. Too many wars. We don't want any more.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More quickly than the political opponents of Slobodan Milosevic had dared hope, grass-roots dissatisfaction with the Yugoslav president is surfacing across much of Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hostility toward Milosevic, bubbling up this week on the streets of the most unlikely of towns, has raised expectations among opposition politicians that Milosevic's survival in power might now be measured not in years, but in months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has particularly raised eyebrows among political analysts, who are beginning to doubt if opposition parties can keep up with grass-roots anger, is the surprise eruption of large and violent protests in the large southern Serb city of Leskovac, a longtime stronghold of the Milosevic regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, without the help of any political party, but with the active involvement of army reservists who fought in the lost war in Kosovo, more than 20,000 people marched on Monday night calling for Milosevic to resign. On Tuesday, about 2, 000 people charged the local police station, demanding the release of the local TV technician who organized Monday's rally.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police responded with tear gas and by beating demonstrators with nightsticks. Demonstrators retreated and later attacked the home of a local political boss who belongs to the Yugoslav Left, a hard-line Communist party headed by Milosevic's wife. They smashed windows in the house and destroyed its front gate, a police official there said by phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If Milosevic is in trouble in Leskovac, then he is really in trouble,'' said Aleksa Djilas, a historian and political analyst in Belgrade who is not affiliated with the opposition groups trying to force the Yugoslav leader from office. ''It is like a Kennedy being in trouble in Boston. This is the beginning of the end. I don't know when the end will happen, but it will be months, not years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The muscular involvement of Yugoslav army reservists in demonstrations in Leskovac is a wild-card element that, if repeated in towns and cities across Serbia, could tip the scales against Milosevic much more quickly than opposition leaders had expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the end of the Kosovo war in early June, hundreds of reservists have intermittently blocked roads and bridges in central and southern Serbia, demanding pay for their service during the 11-week war in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survival skills of Milosevic, who has been indicted on war- crimes charges, should not be underestimated. Although he has lost four wars this decade while presiding over the implosion of the economy, he remains a shrewd politician. He has weathered eruptions of mass unhappiness in Serbia before, most recently in the winter of 1996-97, when three months of daily demonstrations all but paralyzed Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two major tools in his survival kit are an enormous state police apparatus, which is still believed to be loyal, and state television, which is the primary source of information for most of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a consensus among opposition leaders that Milosevic cannot afford politically to use the police to arrest, injure or kill large numbers of Serbs. As Zoran Djindjic, a key opposition leader, said in a rally on Tuesday night in the southwest town of Uzice, ''If there are a lot of us, they will not use force.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, they expect Milosevic to do what he has done in the past, deploy his police and his large party apparatus to harass, intimidate and try to buy off the opposition. For instance, to disrupt an opposition rally planned for tonight in the southern town of Prokuplje, Milosevic's Socialist Party has called its own rally at the same place and time. He tried the same tactic two years ago in Belgrade, without much success in igniting street violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That leaves television, which is doing what it has done so effectively throughout Milosevic's 12 years in power. It ignores or distorts all the news that is bad for Milosevic and his family, while vilifying their rivals and critics as corrupt, anti-Serb traitors. There has been almost no TV coverage, for instance, of this week's trouble in Leskovac or of three large opposition rallies in Serbia in the past week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they have been for years, opposition leaders in Serbia are divided about how best to plug into popular discontent, which is rooted both in anger about the lost war in Kosovo and fear of the collapsing economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> led by the charismatic Vuk Draskovic, had insisted since the war in Kosovo ended that the time was not right for street demonstrations. Draskovic, as recently as Monday, told a news conference that he is a ''legalist'' who wants to press for reform from within the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stunning news from Leskovac, which is controlled by Milosevic's Socialists but where the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the main opposition group, appears to have forced the hand of Draskovic. His party announced yesterday that it will take charge of a rally in Leskovac tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milan Bozic, the deputy mayor of Belgrade and a top leader in the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that all political parties in Serbia have underestimated both the depth of popular </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> feeling and its power to bring people to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''All of sudden, it looks as though frustration over Milosevic is much more deeply embedded into the national consciousness than we expected, '' Bozic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic, a key leader of the Alliance for Change, a coalition of opposition groups, and a rival of Draskovic, delivered a rousing, if vague, speech on Tuesday that envisioned simultaneous daily rallies in towns across the country as well as a general strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic said he expects the Serbian Orthodox Church, which last month demanded that Milosevic resign and which has since been bitterly condemned on state television, will soon join the opposition and ring church bells across the country to call Serbs out on the nationwide general strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing and the planning for that strike are not yet clear, according to Milan Protic, also a leader of the Alliance for Change. He said the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not yet sat down with church leaders to ask for their help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Milosevic regime appears to fear the involvement of the church in politics. Politika, its main newspaper, Wednesday published an angry commentary that condemned church leaders for making peace in Kosovo with ''terrorist'' Albanian leaders and warned the church to avoid the ''murky waters'' of politics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YESTERDAY was a bad day for democracy in Belgrade. A group of nine opposition activists were gathering signatures calling on the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, to resign, when they were attacked and savagely beaten by unidentified thugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortly after the attack, Serbia's parliament voted to keep in effect decrees giving police broad authority to harass and persecute anti-government protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the past two weeks, opposition parties have been gathering signatures across Serbia, calling on President Milosevic to resign.  Despite constant harassment by the authorities, the petition drive has gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures so far.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaign began in Belgrade last Monday at 29 points across the city. Yesterday, in front of a crowded business centre in the new part of town, New Belgrade, Aleksander Spasic, a 49-year-old economist, was one of nine people, four men and five women, manning a petition table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group had already gathered 93 signatures in half an hour when they were savagely set upon by ten men. The attackers all looked alike, with crew cuts and wearing blue jump suits, white T-shirts and white tennis shoes, Mr Spasic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There were about 20 people around our table, signing petitions and talking to us. This band of ten large men pushed their way through the crowd and began to beat us. They even punched a woman who was signing a petition. I was pushed back against a kiosk and repeatedly punched. My glasses fell off, then someone said, 'Forget the old man'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slobodan Djordjevic was even more severely beaten. The 27-year-old unemployed economist was first punched, then repeatedly kicked on the ground by the group of men. He later received numerous stitches on his mouth and under his ear and was examined for possible head trauma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Spasic said that before leaving some of the attackers called the opposition members &quot;traitors&quot; and shouted: &quot;Who's paying you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think it might have ended worse, but a throng of people, mostly women, began shouting at the men, calling them 'bandits' and 'criminals',&quot; said Mr Spasic. &quot;In the 15 minutes following the attack, we gathered another 70 signatures.  Then at the hospital, doctors and nurses signed our petition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The activists said the attackers knew exactly who they were after. When the police arrived 15 minutes later, the activists expected help.  Instead, the police told them they had no right to be there and told them to leave immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They weren't at all interested in the fact that a group of innocent people had just been beaten,&quot; said Dragan Kopcalic of the Democratic Party. The activists refused to leave, but the police came back with a captain who ordered them to leave under threat of arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An hour after the attack, Serbia's parliament voted to indefinitely retain 16 decrees that give police the authority to search citizens at will and require citizens to receive police approval for public gatherings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vote was a strong indication that the government intends to crack down on an opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which is quickly gathering momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Around 8,000 people gathered in a central square in Kragujevac yesterday where leaders of the Alliance for Change denounced Mr Milosevic and appealed for an end to damaging opposition splits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tomorrow, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> led by Vuk Draskovic will stage its first protest in the same town, an industrial centre badly hit by NATO's air campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday's attack in Belgrade was the most violent in a series of government intimidation tactics. Police interrogated an opposition activist, Marko Durisic, earlier in the week. In Nis, petitioners were harassed by police before being driven out of the public market by the security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is obviously an organised attempt to harass and intimidate those who don't support this regime,&quot; said Ljiljana Lucic, vice-president of the Democratic Party, one of the organisers of the petition drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Activists have gathered 13,000 signatures so far at the site of yesterday's attack, and Mr Djordjevic will not be intimidated.  &quot;Am I scared? Of course, but we have to push forward. This is an anti-human regime that stands against civilisation, and there is nothing you can do but be brave. This government has nothing left to offer but violence. We'll be out again tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly founded Democratic Opposition of Serbia alliance has reason to be hopeful it can unseat the Yugoslav president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid fears of war and election fraud, Vojislav Kostunica, leader of the newly founded Democratic Opposition of Serbia alliance, officially kicked off his campaign to replace Slobodan Milosevic as Yugoslavia's president by promising to ''stop the decline of the (Serb) state and nation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made the pledge here in the Yugoslav capital late last week during a brief party convention that introduced the DOS's platform and candidates for parliamentary and presidential elections set for Sept. 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is a new beginning for us, '' university professor Marija Bogdanovic said afterward. ''I cried listening to his speech.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition has reason to be hopeful. Kostunica, a popular figure in Serb politics, is leading the largest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be assembled in Serbia in years. With Yugoslavia on the verge of war and economic collapse, Milosevic's days in power should be numbered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Yugoslavia is split between those who think the election will usher in a new leader and a new beginning and those who argue the vote can only strengthen Milosevic, who has artfully and brutally fended off every challenge to his leadership since coming to power a dozen years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Milosevic's iron rule, many of his opponents say they now have a winning formula and candidate. In his keynote convention speech, Kostunica, a straight-taking law professor, reached out to voters with a 10-point platform for getting Serbia back on track. The DOS, echoing U.S. Republican Party rhetoric from the 1990s, calls the platform its ''Contract with Serbia.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The platform points include promises for ''honest'' government, economic development, renewed ties with the West (and an end to trade sanctions), anti- crime initiatives, a peaceful resolution of the crisis in Montenegro, and ''fair wages for honest work.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica's more dynamic promises include bringing stability to Kosovo, assurances DOS's candidates will not try to profit from elected office, and not to seek vengeance against political opponents should the DOS win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revenge is a sensitive issue, especially among pro-government bureaucrats fearful a change in regime will lead to their ouster and persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I give my word there will not be revenge against people who do not support us,'' Kostunica declared before thousands of delegates. ''No one should fear.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the slogan ''We will win, everyone will benefit,'' Kostunica and the DOS appear to be offering change at the expense of no one but Milosevic and his legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''During the last 10 years, they (the Milosevic regime) have created another artificial face of Serbia, and unfortunately the world believes this image,'' Kostunica said. ''We will present the true face of Serbia.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheering conventioneers appeared to be impressed by Kostunica's words and style. Clearly, Kostunica, an obscure opposition figure until his recent ascendency to the top spot of the DOS, walks and talks differently than Serb politicians of the past and present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DOS leader has a reputation for being a nationalist and a conservative. In fact, Kostunica owes his current stature to editors at Milosevic-controlled state TV who liked and aired his criticisms of NATO and the UN over the Kosovo crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">won't appeal to serb hard-liners</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kostunica has thus far refused to use reactionary rhetoric to appeal to Serb hard-liners in the way that other opposition leaders - such as Vuk Draskovic, the now diminished leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO) who is in hiding in Montenegro after a recent assassination attempt, and Vojislav Seselj, the reactionary leader of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) - have done in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhetoric aside, Kostunica's strongest attributes appear to be a reputation for honesty and a squeaky-clean record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic and Seselj have both cut deals with Milosevic for personal and political gain. Seselj's Radicals are a cornerstone of Milosevic's parliamentary coalition, and Draskovic abandoned his leadership of student protests three years ago to become a deputy prime minister in the Milosevic government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic has refused to stand behind Kostunica in a united front against Milosevic as both the SPO and SRS run their own candidates for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even with the concern that opposition votes will be divided on election day, Kostunica's supporters are optimistic. ''I think we'll be successful,'' declared DOS parliamentary candidate Jeljko Ciric. ''I wouldn't be involved otherwise.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opinion polls predict a DOS victory. According to an editor for the Belgrade newsmagazine NIN, Kostunica now enjoys about 35-per-cent support in Yugoslavia, compared with 24 per cent for Milosevic. Poll data released in July put Kostunica's approval rating at 42 per cent, and Milosevic's at 28 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NIN puts support for Draskovic's SPO in the single digits (8 per cent), but has no idea how much support the Radicals enjoy due to SRS leader Seselj's order that supporters not co-operate with pollsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top officials in Yugoslavia's ruling coalition formally declared Milosevic's candidacy for re-election Sunday, submitting the results of a petition drive intended to show off his support and counter the polls showing the president trailing Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.6 million sign petition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition drive reportedly collected nearly 1.6 million signatures supporting the president even though only 25,000 are required for a candidate. ''This clearly shows people's support for Milosevic's policies of defending national sovereignty, resistance against aggressors, of reconstruction and development,'' said Gorica Gajevic, the secretary-general of Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ciric predicts Kostunica will triumph on a second ballot, which will be required if there is no clear majority winner on the first ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Kostunica will win,'' Ciric said, ''if Milosevic doesn't create a crisis in Montenegro or Kosovo, or if he doesn't cheat.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are signs Milosevic may try both ploys if faced with defeat. ''Now that Milosevic is indicted as a war criminal (by the UN), he cannot lose and retire,'' said Belgrade journalist Svetlana Djurdjevic. ''He has to win.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to analysts, the pro-Milosevic Yugoslav army is fueling tensions daily with Montenegro's republican police force and many Serbs and Montenegrins consider war to be inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has also forbidden international monitors from scrutinizing the vote, a clear indication that Milosevic is setting the stage for election fraud, critics say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If (Milosevic) thinks he's going to lose he could provoke something in Montenegro and persuade people that it wouldn't be convenient to change the chief at this moment,'' said Marko Blagojevic, a board member of the Centre for Free Elections and Democracy (CeSID), a domestic election-watch organization that wants to place monitors at every polling station in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a study of past victories reveals the Yugoslav president may have a system for cheating already ironed out. ''We looked at government records of the last election,'' he said, ''and found that in (the Kosovo village of) Junik there was 100-per- cent support for the SPS candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Junik is completely Albanian. No Serbs lived there. And Kosovar Albanians have boycotted every election for the past 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''So it's impossible to believe an Albanian village voted unanimously for a Serb leader and the SPS without a single vote for another candidate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, Montenegro is boycotting the election, and CeSID is concerned Milosevic may try to win by stuffing imaginary ballot boxes in Montenegro and, incredibly enough, in NATO-occupied Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is the fear,'' Blagojevic admitted. The SPS has further stoked these fears by loudly announcing Milosevic will campaign in both Kosovo and Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also the possibility Milosevic will win fair and square. Milosevic controls the media, and the hearts of many beleaguered Serbs who cannot conceive of another leader. ''Many people are afraid of change,'' said DOS supporter Bogdanovic. ''They think change will only be worse.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the past squabbles and betrayals of the Serb opposition have disillusioned scores of voters who may vote for Milosevic by default.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even supporters with blind faith in Kostunica's ability to win do not believe victory will come easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I don't think Milosevic will give power away without troubles,'' admitted Bogdanovic. ''But I think the people want change. And I think the people have the strength to make it.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Serbia, Aug. 27</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoran Djindjic has been refining his plans, and there have been a lot of them, but he now seems ready to roll the dice to try to oust President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 47, Mr. Djindjic, the urbane and telegenic leader of the Democratic Party, appears to think it is his last chance to rid the country of Mr. Milosevic and his Government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Huge street protests in the winter of 1996-97 petered out after 88 days with Mr. Milosevic in power, but Mr. Djindjic vows that this time he is prepared &quot;to go to the end,&quot; though he can be vague about what that means exactly. In an interview, he said he would lead demonstrations, beginning with a Belgrade rally on Sept. 21, until Mr. Milosevic resigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if that meant that his only options were victory, arrest or exile, Mr. Djindjic shrugged. Later, he said that &quot;if Serbia enters the new century with Mr. Milosevic at its head,&quot; he will retire from politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Milosevic must be gone &quot;by the end of October or early November,&quot; Mr. Djindjic said. But he recognizes that Mr. Milosevic may not be gone, and that his strategy may have to be revised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If ordinary people are not ready to take the risk, we will lose,&quot; he said. &quot;But if they are not ready to be on the streets, I'll be ready and try to lead them there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known for his pragmatism and modern sensibility, Mr. Djindjic, with less to lose, now seems more radical than his rival within the opposition, Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That has made him more attractive to Washington, which had long mistrusted the German-educated Mr. Djindjic as being &quot;too European.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have different interests,&quot; he said of Mr. Draskovic in his much-improved English. &quot;Draskovic doesn't want to change the system. He wants to maintain the privileges of the Government but to change its membership. I want to change the character of the Government itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Draskovic has been plumping lately for early elections under freer conditions, possibly on Nov. 7, and Mr. Milosevic's aides have themselves been suggesting an early vote, Mr. Djindjic says free elections will not be possible while Mr. Milosevic is President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, in the interview Mr. Djindjic said clearly for the first time that his party and the larger opposition coalition, the Alliance for Change, would have to take part in early elections, even with Mr. Milosevic in power -- that they could not credibly boycott the vote, as they did in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said they would try to organize the election as &quot;a referendum on Milosevic,&quot; running slates of candidates that did not include party leaders but would be headed by respected non-politicians like Drago slav Avramovic, the former Central Bank head who brought down Yugoslavia's hyperinflation in 1994, and Momcilo Perisic, who was fired by Mr. Milosevic in November as army chief of staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After meeting with American officials, Mr. Djindjic said he had assurances that these men would agree to lead such a slate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'd say O.K. to elections, but have two million in the streets to wait for the results as a kind of electoral control,&quot; he said. He would hope that street pressure and the imploding of the Government would cause Mr. Milosevic to step down, so that &quot;truly free elections&quot; could then take place with all party leaders running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic said he hoped to step up street pressure slowly but surely, giving the Government no pretext for a crackdown. Under enough pressure, &quot;I believe Milosevic and his wife will leave if they see they have lost,&quot; Mr. Djindjic said. &quot;I don't believe they are brave enough to fight to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, pointing to Mr. Milosevic's indictment on war crimes charges, say that the couple has little alternative but to try to preserve their positions, and that they would not trust promises of safety from cronies, let alone opposition figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic, trained as a philosopher, said the fate of the Milosevics was not his concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Milosevic is not a criminal, but a logical consequence of a part of our history,&quot; he said. &quot;Milosevic is a cause of our problems, but he is also, in an important sense, a consequence of them. But if Milosevic remains in power, and the effort to democratize fails, there will be a further period of state disintegration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But few see many signs of serious cracks in the Government, and some analysts regard Mr. Djindjic's new radicalism in part as an effort to compensate for having fled Serbia during the war over Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Djindjic is simply trying to find his way back to political life,&quot; said Milan Milosevic, a respected political analyst who is not related to the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the opposition has totally overestimated the possibility of revolution in Serbia because of the loss of Kosovo,&quot; Mr. Milosevic said. &quot;Djindjic has no chance as a revolutionary, but all this has helped him to survive politically. And by choosing this more radical path, he has rallied his troops around him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic portrays himself as contemporary, thoughtful and sophisticated. He sees Serbia's other major political figures -- President Milosevic, Mr. Draskovic and Voji slav Seselj, the Radical Party leader and coalition partner of Mr. Milosevic -- as &quot;antimodern,&quot; with their concentration on primitive Communism, traditionalism and nationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insights like that have made him an attractive candidate to the urban educated voters in Serbia who want closer ties to Europe and the rest of the world, especially after the fiasco of the war with NATO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though his rally speeches are improved and popular, he is not a natural rabble-rouser like Mr. Draskovic. In a way he is trying to ride popular discontent as much as to lead it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment, Serbs may be angry, but they are not especially enamored of the opposition leaders. Asked in an opinion poll published on Thursday in Nin magazine which opposition leader &quot;will lead us out of the crisis,&quot; 68 percent of Serbian respondents said &quot;none,&quot; while another 20 percent were undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 4 percent chose Mr. Draskovic, 2.5 percent chose Mr. Avramovic and 2 percent Mr. Perisic. Only 1.5 percent chose Mr. Djindjic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the unknown margin of error in the poll was large, the conclusions are fairly vivid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the problem is that &quot;all opposition leaders are fascinated with the masses,&quot; said Mr. Milosevic the political analyst. Although they only pulled 10 percent of any city's population into summertime rallies, &quot;they see 10,000 people in front of them and they imagine it's a million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they never do the kind of serious local political organizing that President Milosevic's party has always done, and in fact refined since it transformed itself from the Communist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivan Radovanovic, an independent journalist, called Mr. Djindjic &quot;a strange mixture of pragmatism and hysteria, and you never know which will prevail.&quot; Mr. Djindjic, he said, &quot;seems wholly pragmatic, and then something tips him over and he's capable of overthrowing his plans. And Vuk Draskovic drives him crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Mr. Djindjic who was most responsible for the breakup of the opposition coalition, called Zajedno, when he went back on his promise to back Mr. Draskovic in his 1997 presidential campaign and instead boycotted the elections, Mr. Radovanovic said. He noted that in 1993 Mr. Djindjic negotiated his own coalition deal with President Milosevic, pulling out only at the end, although four from his party joined the Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the 1996-97 protests, &quot;Djindjic was spoken of as a Serbian Vaclav Havel and he thought he could run the opposition,&quot; Mr. Milosevic said. &quot;But he had big problems with Draskovic, who saw himself as the king of the streets&quot; and who, once betrayed, engineered Mr. Djindjic's ouster as Mayor of Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of that and the 1997 election boycott, Mr. Djindjic &quot;for two years has been out of the game and in crisis, and his party has been in crisis, too,&quot; Mr. Milosevic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made matters worse by fleeing the country during NATO's bombing campaign, his life under threat. Government propaganda took full advantage and called him a coward, a traitor and a tool of NATO, charges that Mr. Draskovic's party echoes, though less crudely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Mr. Djindjic, the Alliance for Change and Mr. Draskovic have explored one strategy after another, the summer has been wasted in disputes and a now-dead plan for a transitional government of experts that President Milosevic would never have accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the period after the capitulation in Kosovo -- when the Milosevic Government was rocked on its heels and seemed extremely shaky, with the army and police unsure -- was not exploited, even though the opposition probably could have united those angry with President Milosevic for prosecuting the war and those angry with him for losing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, with the Serbs nearly expelled from Kosovo under NATO eyes, it is easier for Mr. Milosevic to argue that the war was worth fighting, given the consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The opposition never seems to anticipate anything,&quot; Mr. Radovanovic said. &quot;They only react to Milosevic and to events, and to the insults of each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now President Milosevic's suggestion of early elections has further divided the opposition. But despite all the confusion and the skepticism, Mr. Djindjic is steeling himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that this is the last opportunity to get rid of Milosevic,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not just the last chance for me, but for us as a country.&quot;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">KRAGUJEVAC, Yugoslavia, Nov. 29</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoran Nedeljkovic is known as &quot;the bear&quot; around Kragujevac and the massive Red Flag weapons factory where he has toiled since high school. With a bulldog mug suggesting Harvey Keitel minus a few teeth and the gruff manner of Yugoslavia's working class, he plays and looks the part. Especially these days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the leader of one of the biggest branches of Yugoslavia's main trade union, Nedeljkovic is the only major union boss to back the most sustained protests ever against Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's government. Nedeljkovic has broken with the state-led leadership of the Association of Autonomous Unions of Serbia, which has condemned the demonstrations, because he believes Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia should recognize opposition electoral victories in 15 of Yugoslavia's 18 cities and hand over power in those towns.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 39-year-old union boss is no Lech Walesa. His support for the opposition, a coalition of five parties that call themselves Together, is as qualified as it is courageous. He opposes the idea of a general strike to oust Milosevic. He did not allow any officers of his union shop to contest seats in the local election against the Socialists. And, he says, he wants to keep the goals of his union -- &quot;secure jobs, a good wage and an eight-hour working day&quot; -- separate from politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nedeljkovic's measured encouragement illustrates a significant problem facing Serbia's Together coalition as its protesters marked a 12th straight day of anti-government demonstrations in Belgrade, Nis, Kragujevac and other cities around the country: Any attempt to oust the Serbian president, or at least force him to recognize election results, needs the wholehearted assistance of Yugoslavia's working class. But so far the only support Together can obtain from Serbia's workers is the lukewarm endorsement of one major union chief, Nedeljkovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not gain more support, opposition officials acknowledged, their challenge to Milosevic probably will fizzle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Students and white collar protesters cannot do it alone,&quot; said one opposition leader. &quot;While damage will have been done to Milosevic, he will survive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kragujevac once was the apex of Serb industry. It is the headquarters of the Red Flag group of companies, which made the Yugo car, trucks and tens of thousands of AK-47 automatic rifles at its flagship factory and Nedeljkovic's employer: Red Flag Special Products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, of the 11,000 workers employed at the Yugo factory, perhaps 15 percent are working. Their average salary is $ 20 a month. Things are only slightly better for the 2,500 workers at the truck plant. Red Flag Special Products, however, has done the best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bear&quot; is a cautious warrior. Like many in his union, he wants changes in Yugoslavia but does not know if Together is capable of delivering. &quot;Our aim is to prove that the Socialists can be beaten,&quot; he said. &quot;I really hope that I'm on the right side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nedeljkovic became union chief in this town 140 miles south of Belgrade in 1994 in an election that the Socialists attempted unsuccessfully to rig, he said. Both his father and grandfather had worked at the weapons plant. Those roots, he said, helped him win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Aug. 19, Nedeljkovic led his workers on strike in one of the most significant labor actions in Yugoslavia in years. They had not been paid for several months. Nedeljkovic broke with union leaders in Belgrade and had his men walk out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike lasted two months. An envoy of Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, came to see Nedeljkovic, who said he was offered a vice presidency in Markovic's Yugoslav United Left organization -- a successor of the former ruling communist party that is now allied with her husband's Socialist Party. The tactic is a normal one for the Milosevics, who have sought to co-opt troublemakers by buying them off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we're on opposite sides,&quot; Nedeljkovic said. &quot;I told them to get lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, Red Flag's workers won back pay and benefits, appointment of union representatives to Red Flag's executive board and a new factory manager, approved by the union. They went back to work Oct. 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discontent with the Socialist Party is high in Kragujevac. The town's mayor, Zivorad Nesic, recently has been implicated in a scam to build a private shopping mall with government money. A local independent newspaper also alleged that Nesic used money from an urban redevelopment fund to bankroll his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In local elections Nov. 17, Together crushed Milosevic's Socialists, but the local election commission, also controlled by Milosevic, did not recognize the results and ordered a new election, held Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike in Belgrade and the southern Serbian city of Nis, the opposition participated in Wednesday's vote. Opposition officials said today that the results were the same. Together took 61 percent of the city council's seats.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zoran Djindjic, Prime Minister of the Republic of Serbia since January 2001, was born on August 1, 1952. He was assassinated in Belgrade on March 12, 2003, aged 50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dissident voice in Tito's Yugoslavia who emerged as the pragmatic leader of a new Serbian state</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prime Minister of Serbia since January 2001, Zoran Djindjic had made his name in the West as &quot;the West's man&quot; in post- Milosevic Yugoslavia. In many ways he resembled such contemporaries as Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schroder, in that he seemed to be above all else a pragmatist who had no great visions but was prepared, like Bismarck, to float and steer upon the river of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it was not always so, and his political outlook evolved with the great changes that affected his country. To his supporters this was sensible and productive realism, to his opponents it was opportunism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zoran Djindjic was born in the Bosnian village of Bosanski Samac in 1952, the son of a Yugoslav army officer. He showed early political awareness when he tried to collect signatures protesting against a new law that made Marshal Tito President of Yugoslavia for life. Although punished for this indiscretion he went on to complete a philosophy degree at Belgrade University, only to run foul of the authorities once again when, in 1974, together with like-minded students from Croatia and Slovenia, he attempted to found a non-communist student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For this he and his would-be colleagues were sentenced to one year's imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On his release Djindjic left for West Germany to read for a doctorate. He studied under Jurgen Habermas at the University of Frankfurt when that institution was still associated with the student protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was said that Djindjic became interested in extreme organisations such as the Baader-Meinhof Gang and the Red Army Faction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic received his doctorate from the University of Konstanz in 1979. His thesis was entitled Marx's critical social theory and problems of justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In it he developed an epistemological basis for Marx's theory that a crisis is necessary in society for the old order to be swept away and a new one created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic wrote a few years later that he had gone to Frankfurt because he believed that was the only place where he would find the new intellectual nourishment which would enable Marxism to adapt to and thrive in the new realities of Yugoslavia, realities that Djindjic seemed to think were already too liberal and too bourgeois. Yet, even when he was a student in Germany, Djindjic had been involved with the class enemy, selling textile machines and making clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Back in Yugoslavia, Djindjic abandoned commerce to teach philosophy in the universities of Novi Sad and Belgrade. But within a few years he was fully engaged in politics. In 1979 he was one of the youngest participants in a summer school on the island of Korcula run by the Praxis group of critical, Marxist intellectuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the final vestiges of the communist monopoly of power disappeared, Djindjic became one of the founders of the Democratic Party, and two years later, in 1990, he became its chairman and in 1994 its president. He was elected to the Serbian parliament in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic then moved his supposedly centrist party closer to Serbian nationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1994, when the Bosnian Serbs were ordered by the Western powers to end the bombardment of Sarajevo, Djindjic showed, as he said, &quot;solidarity with the Bosnian Serbs&quot; by going to the Bosnian Serb capital, Pale, and partaking of a roasted ox with Radovan Karadjic. Djindjic also had occasional meetings with the notorious Arkan, Zeljko Raznatovic, who led one of the groups of irregulars fighting in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet when Serbian nationalism was defeated and the Dayton accord signed in 1995 Djindjic sought a new tack, one which brought him into direct opposition to President Milosevic. He played a major role in bring about Zajedno (Together), an alliance of three </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parties. At the end of 1996 the alliance secured notable victories in local elections in a number of key Serbian cities, including Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though Milosevic initially tried to discount the elections, his hand was forced by massive public protests and by Western pressure, and in February 1997 Djindjic became the first non-communist Mayor of Belgrade since 1945. The Zajedno alliance did not last long. By the summer its constituent parties were squabbling, and in September Djindjic was forced from his mayoral office after having been accused of &quot;incompetence&quot; by his erstwhile ally, Vuk Draskovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic now performed another about-face and abandoned the more vociferous nationalists. In December 1996 he had told the German magazine Der Spiegel that he was &quot;the horse which the West should back&quot;, and after his removal from Belgrade town hall he concentrated on gathering round him a group of experts who could help to reconstruct a Serbian economy battered by years of war and sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only in the West, he argued, could the requisite expertise and capital be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This did not mean that he condoned Nato action against Serbia in 1999, but once that had ended he pushed hard for Serbia's re-integration into the Western world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He therefore became an even more determined opponent of Milosevic and played a significant role in his removal, by liaising with vital state institutions and military leaders in October 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of that year Djindjic was at the head of a new coalition, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, which secured an easy victory in the Serbian parliamentary elections in December. Djindjic assumed office as Prime Minister of Serbia in January 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As prime minister Djindjic continued his pro-Western line but it was one which brought him into frequent conflict with the then President of Yugoslavia, Vojislav Kostunica. Their differences were never greater than over the question of whether Milosevic should be extradited to face the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague, and it was Djindjic who sanctioned Milosevic's extradition in June 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following day an international donors' conference in Brussels offered Yugoslavia $ 1.28 billion in grants and loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic was universally recognised as a powerful intellect and an organiser of prodigious talents. But as with many politicians of his generation there was always doubt as to what, if any, were his core beliefs, and he never enjoyed the popular support accorded to his fellow- intellectual and opponent, Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Serbian presidential elections of 2002 Djindjic chose to back Miroslav Labus rather than run himself. Nevertheless, to many Serbs Djindjic remained what one British newspaper had called him after the fall of Milosevic: &quot;the shadow kingmaker&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only last month Djindjic survived what may have been another attempt on his life, when a truck suddenly swerved out of its lane towards a convoy of cars, one of which was carrying him. At the time observers believed the near-miss might have been linked to his Government's attempts to stamp out organised crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In February, too, Serbia formally joined a loose federation with Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic had also announced recently that Serbia would support a breakaway Serbian mini-state in Kosovo if the West prevented Serbian troops from returning there to guarantee the rights of the ethnic minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic is survived by his wife Ruzica, a lawyer, and by a son and a daughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LESKOVAC, Yugoslavia -- Thousands of angry Serbs, including many<BR>soldiers who fought in Kosovo, demonstrated here for a third straight<BR>night Wednesday to demand that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic<BR>resign immediately or risk being ousted by angry mobs.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are ready to go to the end, to civil war and even bloodshed,<BR>to get changes,&quot; said Nesic Dobrosav, director of the Committee<BR>for Human Rights.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're expecting the worst. Neither side is going to give in<BR>without a fight.&quot;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tens of thousands were expected to demonstrate today in the southern<BR>Serbian town of Prokuplje, near Kosovo's provincial border.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley said, &quot;Milosevic's<BR>days are numbered. (But) it's impossible to predict how many numbers<BR>there are in those days.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign that the pro-Milosevic forces intend to fight back,<BR>the president's ruling Socialist Party called its own rally at<BR>the same place and time in Prokuplje, raising the prospect of<BR>clashes.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, a top opposition leader urged Serb citizens<BR>to hold daily protests in their cities and towns until Milosevic<BR>steps down.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoran Djindjic, leader of the Democratic Party, said Serbia's<BR>opposition groups soon might call for a nationwide strike to show<BR>their dissatisfaction with the Yugoslav leader.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every day we must be in the streets until (Milosevic) resigns,&quot;<BR>Djindjic said. &quot;The whole of Serbia should be in a state of civil<BR>disobedience.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoran Zivkovic, the mayor of Nis, Serbia's third-largest city,<BR>said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> momentum is &quot;sweeping Serbia&quot; and cannot<BR>be stopped.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a people's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and they're angry,&quot; he said.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowhere have the protests been as strong as in Leskovac, a city<BR>of 170,000 about 150 miles south of Belgrade. The demonstrations<BR>were sparked this week after a television engineer, Ivan Novkovic,<BR>went on the air to demand the dismissal of local officials from<BR>Milosevic's party. In answer to his call, 20,000 people demonstrated<BR>Monday in a town that had been considered a Milosevic stronghold.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Novkovic was jailed for calling the protest. On Tuesday, 1,500<BR>people clashed with anti-riot police to demand his release. Demonstrators<BR>rushed to a house belonging to a local Milosevic ally, smashing<BR>its windows and breaking down a fence.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I could, I'd skin Milosevic alive, slowly,&quot; said Zivko Lalic,<BR>a Serbian refugee from Kosovo now living here. &quot;There's no going<BR>back. We want him out.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SERBIAN President Slobodan Milosevic is reported to have offered to hold early elections in the face of resounding calls demanding he step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic's offer on Wednesday appeared to be a last-minute concession to try to defuse Yugoslavia's political crisis and deflate an anti-Government rally planned for yesterday in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Serbian parliament, dominated by Mr Milosevic's regime, is expected to decide on an election date next month, according to sources close to his Socialist Party and the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Vuk Draskovic, independent news agency Beta reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, opposition leaders say they would only agree to Mr Milosevic's offer to hold early elections if the vote is monitored by international observers. Elections are technically scheduled for 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We believe that there are more important things on the nation's agenda than the elections but, if the opposition wants that, so be it,&quot; said Ivica Dacic, a spokesman for the Socialist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Wednesday, 20,000 people rallied in the country's third-largest city of Nis, chanting &quot;resignations, resignations,&quot; Beta said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rally came on the eve of a protest in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, the first since the start of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign in late June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is Belgrade's turn to show whether it is for change,&quot; the mayor of Nis, Zoran Zivkovic of the Democratic Party, told protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zoran Djindjic, head of the Democratic Party, said he expected 200,000 people at the rally in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition activists acknowledge that it will not be easy to persuade Mr Milosevic to step aside, especially since rows between political leaders have caused widespread disillusion among ordinary Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US officials yesterday urged the opposition to work tog-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ether to speed Mr Milosevic's ouster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The more unified they act, the quicker the chances are that Milosevic will leave the scene, and the quicker therefore that the people of Yugoslavia and Serbia will be able to live the life they deserve to,&quot; State Department spokesman James Rubin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most opposition leaders say the President's resignation is a precondition for any reform. They say Mr Milosevic, who has been indicted by a UN court for war crimes in Kosovo, is too isolated to lead Yugoslavia out of its unprecedented crisis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slobodan Milosevic is running for another term as Yugoslavia's president in an unfair election that he will most likely win by any means necessary. Nevertheless, the opposition should run against him. No one believes that Mr. Milosevic will leave office simply because voters tell him to. But if the opposition can unite on a single presidential candidate for the elections, in late September, it can at least revitalize its popular support and shake some of the apathy that is paralyzing Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition will certainly run candidates in local elections. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> candidates won in more than 30 municipalities in 1996, although protesters had to occupy the streets for months in order to get Mr. Milosevic to recognize the victories.  These local officials give the opposition control of some funds and broadcast media, in addition to political stature and a base for organizing. The posts are crucial to keep. The opposition should also run candidates in the federal Parliament to reduce Mr. Milosevic's near-total control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Milosevic has taken no chances with his own re-election. Recently he has shut down many of the remaining independent media in Serbia, and has been intimidating opposition politicians and independent activists through violence and abuse of the courts. His ubiquitous propaganda allows him to remain the most popular politician in Serbia. But he is helped by a petty and ineffectual opposition. Polls, however, show that if the opposition united around a single candidate, that person could win. Even if there is little chance the winner would be allowed to take office, this would energize the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend there is a convention of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> whose leader, Vuk Draskovic, is the main obstacle to a united opposition. Mr. Draskovic has in the past cut deals with Mr. Milosevic and sabotaged opposition unity, acts that should disqualify him as a candidate this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic has said that his party will not participate in the elections if Milo Djukanovic, the president of Serbia's tiny sister republic of Montenegro, stays out as well. But Mr. Djukanovic, who has led his republic in a mutiny against the Yugoslav president, has a better reason for boycotting. He is already under the constant threat of attack from the Yugoslav army stationed in Montenegro -- an attack that Washington fears may come soon. The presidential election will be staged with new rules that are part of a recent constitutional coup by Mr. Milosevic, which greatly reduced Montenegro's influence in the presidential election and over all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the opposition does contest the election and Mr. Milosevic wins, countries such as Russia, Greece and Italy should not use his &quot;victory&quot; as a pretext to improve their relations with Serbia. They well know he keeps power through repression. Nor should Mr. Milosevic look forward to a change in American policy if Gov. George W. Bush becomes president. The Republican platform says there should be no negotiations with indicted war criminals such as Mr. Milosevic, and that Washington should seek their arrest, trial and imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contesting Mr. Milosevic for the presidency requires opposition unity. Democratic opposition parties were able to beat Vladimir Meciar in Slovakia and Franjo Tudjman's party in Croatia only when they overcame their internal squabbles. Mr. Milosevic is more malignant, but that only makes unity even more necessary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Clinton administration is deeply divided over Kosovo -albeit behind the scenes. Nato bombing has not forced President Slobodan Milosevic to cave in as expected. US officials are desperate to find a way out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, there were signs of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Bill Clinton, after days of near-silence, delivered an impassioned speech about the importance of prevailing in Kosovo. He evoked gruesome examples of the atrocities allegedly being carried out by Serb forces. The clear hint was that he was preparing American opinion for a possible ground intervention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would be a major, and welcome, development -an admission that bombing alone is a failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it would not be enough. Nato -led by the Americans who are needed for any solution -- should have the imagination, the guts and the determination to go further. It is quite clear to anyone who has even casually studied the Balkans these past few years that there is one root cause of instability in the region. His name is Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This evil dictator deliberately stirred nationalism to bring himself to power in 1987. Since then, he has gathered all reins of power in his own hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even his top aides are rarely briefed on his negotiations. Over the years, he has become steadily more repressive. On the many occasions his people have come out in demonstrations against him, he has turned his police on them or stirred more war and trouble to distract attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nato bombing has only strengthened his grip on power. Even </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> liberals are out in the streets protesting the bombing. &quot;I am against Milosevic, but I am not against my country,&quot; said one, summing up the sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the broad Serb public, long fed nationalistic propaganda, the bombing has confirmed a historical sense of victimisation -first at the hands of the Turks, then the Nazis, now Nato. It has also facilitated a national denial: as victims, they do not have to take responsibility or even own up to the Kosovo horrors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serb dictator, meanwhile, has taken advantage of the Kosovo distraction to increase his tyrannical hold at home. He has fired dozens of Belgrade university professors who refused to sign a pledge of allegiance to his government, for example. And he has shut down or taken over the last few non-government media outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While support for Mr Milosevic in Serbia is a mile wide, however, it is an inch thick. It could easily crumble if Serbs were given a way out, shown a path to the Europe they had keenly wanted to join in the late 1980s and early 1990s when they saw themselves as part of a democratic wave sweeping across Eastern and Central Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step to achieve this would be to get rid of Mr Milosevic. Nato should do that by declaring him a war criminal. To suggest that it does not have enough evidence to send him to the Hague is nonsense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real reason the US in particular is holding back is it thinks it needs him to be a &quot;guarantor&quot; of peace. But that is a cave-in: setting the stage for him to stir more trouble in, say, his multi-ethnic northern province of Vojvodina or among his Muslims in the Sandzak region as soon as he again needs to distract his people's attention to keep his grip on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nato needs to go further than a Hague indictment, though. Serbs are in no psychological state after 12 years of Mr Milosevic to pick up the physical or psychological pieces on their own. What they need is a Marshall Plan and an allied takeover of the kind that occurred in Germany and Japan after World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A high-publicity Nuremberg-style trial of Mr Milosevic and his chief lieutenants would help Serbs face and come to terms with the terrible things that have been committed by some of them and in their name. The institutions needed to build democracy from the ground up could also be installed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harvard historian Daniel Goldhagen, who wrote &quot;Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust&quot;, has already launched that idea, publishing a manifesto in which he said that Serbia should &quot;be placed in receivership&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others have taken up the theme. Mr Thomas Schwartz, another American historian, commented that &quot;when Germany was totally defeated, it provided opportunity. You could be physically there, controlling the flow of information and using war-crime trials to show the Germans that atrocities were done in their name&quot;. Without something similar in Serbia, he said, &quot;we can look forward to more trouble in Serbia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What reminds me of Germany is the comparison to the end of World War I,&quot; he added. &quot;Then, the Germans had this powerful sense of being victims. There was a deep resentment that Hitler was able to exploit. It will be the same in Serbia when Nato bombing stops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Particularly if the eventual settlement in Kosovo is an unsatisfactory peace deal that leaves Mr Milosevic in power -after, perhaps, caving in to Nato following a ground intervention in Kosovo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE -- The head of Serbia's influential Orthodox Church and the country's main opposition leaders agreed on Monday to join a mass anti- government rally in Belgrade on Aug. 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm very optimistic,'' Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic Party said when asked if Serbia's often-divided opposition could finally join forces to oust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the rally would be the first joint step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The synod of the Orthodox Church, which in the past has tended to stay out of politics, called at a meeting in June for Milosevic to quit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic spoke to reporters after a two-hour meeting that opposition leaders and a group of independent economists had with Patriarch Pavle and other Church dignitaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first reaction to the meeting, the Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug, which often reflects the government position, accused the Serb opposition of pressing the Church to take up an unconstitutional role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ultra- nationalist Radical Party, a long-time Milosevic ally, accused ''certain minor political groupings'' of trying to provoke a break within the Serbian Orthodox Church, Tanjug reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Party said the Church had never been nor should be anyone's party outlet and it expected the Church to remain outside the political struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Church leaders earlier met former Yugoslav army chief General Momcilo Perisic, sacked by Milosevic last November after he questioned the president's Kosovo policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perisic was reported by opposition sources to have founded a new opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Sunday to add to the growing pressure on Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Church is the only institution in Serbia with credibility now, and it has pledged to take an active role in the forthcoming political process,'' Djindjic said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Serbia's darkest hours, Zoran Djindjic stood up to the Balkans' worst dictator and single-handedly engineered Slobodan Milosevic's extradition to the United Nations war crimes tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the autocratic ruler was toppled, Serbia's prime minister spearheaded democratic reforms meant to pull the republic - long ostracized by the world - back into Europe's mainstream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two bullets fired yesterday ended the life and aspirations of Djindjic, the man who personified Serbia's hopes for a better future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters pronounced Djindjic their country's &quot;own Kennedy,&quot; after the admired and assassinated U.S. president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born Aug. 1, 1952, to the family of a Yugoslav army officer in Bosanski Samac in neighbouring Bosnia - then part of the former Yugoslavia's six-state communist federation - Djindjic was raised and educated in Belgrade. He studied in the philosophy department of the capital's university, then a hotbed of liberal opposition to Tito's communist government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1977, he left to earn a doctorate in philosophy at Heidelberg, Germany. His academic career continued abroad, mostly at German universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A passionate anti-communist, Djindjic joined the Democratic party in its founding days and took over its helm in 1994. Milosevic's autocratic rule had already plunged the country into a series of ethnic wars that wreaked Europe's worst carnage since the Second World War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1997, with the Zajedno (Together) coalition, Djindjic led three months of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests that daily challenged the dictator's police on Belgrade streets and caught the attention of freedom-fighters the world over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1999, Djindjic succeeded in uniting Serbia's fledgling pro-democracy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and propelled the rise of Vojislav Kostunica in a popular uprising that swept Milosevic from power in October 2000. After Kostunica succeeded Milosevic as Yugoslavia's president, Djindjic emerged as the second-most-powerful man in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic's pro-Western government worked hard to bring the country into Europe's mainstream. For many Serbs, joining the European Union - and the promise of Western investment, open borders and free trade - was seen as the only way out of their misery of 60-per-cent joblessness and staggering inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But once in the prime minister's office, Djindjic accused Kostunica of nationalist rhetoric, pessimism and lack of determination to carry out changes after Milosevic's ouster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica countered by saying Djindjic sought to turn Serbia into a &quot;Colombia-style&quot; mafia state, and he criticized the prime minister's suave public image, entourage of bodyguards and upscale lifestyle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic was aware his pro-western stance led to shaky popularity in Serbia, where strong nationalism still prevails and where many believe the West is anti-Serb. But he calmly pledged to continue on his reform path, and he declared an open war on the rampant organized crime that had engulfed the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica and Djindjic finally split, with Djindjic outmanoeuvring Kostunica when what remained of Yugoslavia was transformed last month into a new, loose union renamed Serbia and Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic's term was due to expire in 2004. It was not immediately clear who might succeed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite their bitter animosity, Kostunica yesterday deplored Djindjic's assassination, saying that while they disagreed on many issues, the shots that took Djindjic's life were &quot;proof that terrorism must be condemned and fought relentlessly, everywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE (AP) - Tens of thousands of people massed in Serbia's capital today to denounce President Slobodan Milosevic for the long war over Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia and the crumbling economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chanting &quot;Slobo, Hitler&quot; and &quot;Slobo, Saddam,&quot; they defied a government warning the rally could bring a repeat of violence that erupted a year ago today when police and army tanks moved against 200,000 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protesters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two people died, scores were hurt and hundreds arrested during four days of unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's demonstration ended after three hours with no incidents reported. Reporters estimated about 50,000 people gathered on St. Sava's plateau for the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's renamed Communists won multiparty elections in Serbia two years ago and still enjoy sizeable support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But opposition has been growing over the civil war's human toll as well as runaway inflation and a 20 per cent unemployment rate. Other Serbs are angry over the U.N.-sponsored truce in Croatia, accusing Milosevic of abandoning ethnic Serbs in that republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hunger is knocking on the door of Serbia,&quot; Vuk Draskovic, head of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Milosevic's chief rival, told the rally. &quot;Our Serbia must become . . .  a state of the future not of the past, a construction site, not a barracks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 15 opposition parties that called the demonstration called for new elections, a new constitution, freedom of the press and fundamental economic changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgrade television says 579,000 people have signed a petition demanding Milosevic's resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camouflage-clad riot police patrolled downtown, but few officers were visible near the demonstration. Three jeeps manned by police wearing flak jackets guarded Milosevic's house several kilometres from the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Belgrade rally was much smaller than last year, organizers said they were satisfied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vojislav Kostunica cuts an unlikely figure as hero and prospective saviour of Yugoslavia. While despairing Serbs and Western leaders looked the other way in search of a Balkan braveheart to rise up and cut the chains that have kept Slobodan Milosevic in power for the past decade, the quietly spoken rival for the presidency slipped under the ropes and felled him at the ballot box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, hundreds of thousands of people swarmed through the capital to demand Milosevic accept his apparent electoral defeat by Kostunica in the Sept. 24 election. The uprising developed with stunning speed, swelling as security forces showed little willingness to battle the largest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protest ever.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after the end of the NATO bombing campaign last year, many war and sanctions-weary Serbs looked high and low for someone to lead them against the regime. The political options were bleak: the maverick fence-sitter Vuk Draskovic and his Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on one hand, and the Democratic party leader Zoran Djindjic on the other. Djindjic's error was to leave Belgrade at the height of the bombing; it was seen as an act of cowardice by ordinary Serbs who had no choice but to stay put.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To make matters worse, Djindjic and Draskovic proved repeatedly that they could not put personal differences aside and present a united opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A series of opposition rallies around Serbia in the weeks that followed the Alliance campaign were little more than Sunday outings for the curious and a chance for the two opposition groups to squabble. The only exceptions came when protests were organized by two independent rebels: Ivan Novkovic, a renegade television weatherman in the southern town of Leskovac, and Bogoljub ''Maki'' Arsenijevic, an artist from the central town of Valjevo. However, while these two would-be revolutionaries galvanized people in their home towns, they were never serious contenders for the post of president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this time, Kostunica waited quietly for his moment in history. It came when Milosevic decided to call early elections and Kostunica was chosen to head a multi-party democratic opposition. Whereas the West had been less than accurate in reading the Balkan mentality, Kostunica had read the runes well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He knew that many Serbs had become wary of firebrand politics and paramilitary adventurism. His message has been an almost Gandhi-esque appeal to peaceful resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So who is the man who now seems to have achieved what would have looked impossible even three months ago -- levering Milosevic from power? And will he meet the West's expectations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vojislav Kostunica, a married man with no children, was nominated as the candidate of 18 parties and one trade union that form the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS). Born to an old Belgrade family in 1944, he graduated from the Belgrade School of Law in 1966 and went on to obtain a master's degree in 1970 and doctorate in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1970 he was appointed assistant lecturer at the Belgrade School of Law, but was expelled in 1974 during a political purge of Belgrade University, because of his opposition to communism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 1974 until 1981, he worked at the Institute of Social Sciences. He moved on to become director of the Institute for Philosophy and Social Theory. Until recently, his main claim to fame was as a bookish academic and author of papers on constitutional law, political theory and political philosophy. Kostunica has also worked as editor-in-chief of several specialized journals dedicated to law and philosophy, such as the Archive for Legal and Social Sciences, Philosophical Studies, Philosophy and Society and Theoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the '80s, while Milosevic was climbing the greasy pole to supreme power, Kostunica turned his legal skills to human rights and was especially active in the board for the freedom of thought and speech, where he was highly regarded. It was around this time that he became involved in politics, becoming a founder of the Democratic party in 1989. He has been president of the separate Democratic party of Serbia since it was founded in 1992 and was a member of the Serbian parliament from 1990 until 1997, when his party boycotted the elections due to the ''lack of regular electoral conditions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western leaders, however, have been nonplussed. Although senior European Union, American and even Russian politicians have been swift to call on Milosevic to hand power to Kostunica, the lawyer has not always been flavour of the month, especially in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica has consistently proclaimed that he would not hand Milosevic over to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, and he was a vigorous critic of the NATO bombardment. This has been seized on by some as proof that he is no different from other war-zealous Balkan leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica has been described in some U.S. state department background briefings as an old- fashioned Serb nationalist, a sort of ''Seselj in coat-tails'' -- a reference to Milosevic's erstwhile ally, Vojislav Seselj, the ultra-nationalist leader of the Serbian Radical party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is where East and West divide. Opponents of the Milosevic regime see nothing wrong in criticizing the NATO campaign, for the bombing affected nearly everyone. While they may be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they believe their political destiny should be decided from within.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Kostunica is a good patriot. He is educated, a peaceful man and no threat to anyone,'' says Srdjan Stojanovic, an independent Serbian journalist who lives in London. ''He is a calm, even boring speaker, but he insists on following legal procedures. That is what our country needs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nikola Barovic, a noted Serbian human rights lawyer, agrees. ''He is a very good lawyer and has a high regard for fair play. Because he is very strict and correct, I think he will do all he can to help keep things peaceful,'' he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And an expatriate Serb points out: ''He is a politician of impeccable democratic credentials, keen intelligence and high personal integrity. He has not compromised himself either by making deals with Milosevic, unlike Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or by being too subservient to the West like, say, Zoran Djindjic. His consistency and perseverance has finally paid off.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A MAN considered a mouthpiece for Yugoslav President Slobodan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic has suddenly upstaged him with a bold suggestion that troops</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from NATO countries could play a role in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Premier Vuk Draskovic said yesterday Yugoslavia would accept a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN peacekeeping force for Kosovo that could include soldiers from NATO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, said Mr Draskovic, both Mr Milosevic and Russian special</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">envoy Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin shared his views in separate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conversations with each of them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a stance by Mr Milosevic would mark a huge concession by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yugoslav leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Milosevic has steadfastly rejected the concept of any foreign armed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">forces in Kosovo as part of a peace settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he has ruled out any presence in Kosovo of &quot;aggressor countries&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his term for NATO nations. The US and its NATO allies continue to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">insist on a strong NATO-led force in Kosovo as part of any peace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Mr Milosevic, Mr Draskovic and Moscow are indeed of one mind,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Mr Milosevic is using his deputy leader to voice a new stand on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kosovo, then the two sides are more in tune with each other than at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">any time since the NATO airstrikes began on March 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Mr Draskovic has a track record of unpredictability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments could mean less a change in thinking by the Yugoslav</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">regime and more an attempt to distance himself from Mr Milosevic and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">position himself as a possible alternative for the Yugoslav</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he joined Mr Milosevic's Government last year, the flamboyant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">former opposition leader was accused of selling out by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many, he turned into Mr Milosevic's moderate voice once he joined</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Government. When Mr Milosevic sounded tough, Mr Draskovic was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conciliatory on Kosovo during the two rounds of talks in France that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ended in failure and led to the NATO air strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the start of the air campaign, Mr Draskovic's language was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">passionately pro-Serb but low-key compared with others in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic camp. He broke that mould on Monday when, in an interview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with Studio B his party's television station the bearded firebrand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">suddenly condemned both the leadership and its propaganda campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments aroused immediate attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside Serbia, some now applaud Mr Draskovic for shattering the image</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nurtured by State media of a people determined to fight to the last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rather than bend to NATO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the second time in less than a week, NATO yesterday blasted a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">high-rise building described as the &quot;nerve centre&quot; of Mr Milosevic's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ruling machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A huge explosion shook the 23-storey Usce Centre building, which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">houses offices of Mr Milosevic's socialist party and offices of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">several broadcast stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, the Red Cross was finally allowed to see the three US</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">soldiers captured by Yugoslav forces last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the UN relief agency said it had credible evidence that Serb</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">forces were using Kosovo refugees as human shields to help protect</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them from NATO airstrikes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Czechoslovakia deposed its communists in a Velvet Revolution. Serbia's political opposition may be in the middle of a garlic revolution. Despite an eruption of violence on Tuesday that claimed the life of a protester, well-armed riot police and wintry weather, tens of thousands of students and opposition members took to the streets on Thursday and again on Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many students carried strings of garlic to ward off &quot;communist vampires, &quot; a humorous but pointed message. The regime's opponents have given no indication that they plan to desist: &quot;We will march . . . until they fulfill our demands,&quot; said student leader Cedomir Jovanovic. Those demands have begun to include the resignation of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. That outcome, which once seemed completely implausible, no longer looks impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unable to tolerate even the mildest dissent, Mr. Milosevic has no one but himself to blame. He tossed out the results of local elections when they were not to his liking. He then escalated the situation, and ruled out a possibility of compromise, by using the courts to ratify his illegal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout this crisis, Mr. Milosevic has seemed bewildered that people, denied a voice within the system, would take their peaceful protests outside, to the streets. But instead of intimidating his rivals into silence, his increasingly severe reactions have pushed Mr. Milosevic into the corner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally this week, Mr. Milosevic was reduced to borrowing a page from Nicolae Ceaucescu's crude book on crowd control; he bused in rural supporters to provoke conflict with peaceful protesters. As expected, violence broke out: 58 people were injured, and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> now has its first martyr - Predrag Starcevic, who died of beatings inflicted by Milosevic supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Milosevic may end up regretting that move because his supporters may have had their eyes opened. Dependent on government propaganda, they reportedly were astonished to see how widespread opposition to the regime is and how the opponents are not just the thugs and hooligans portrayed on government TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and the West are largely observers to this process. But they can keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic by reimposing sanctions should he engage in a violent crackdown. Even his friends - Montenegro and Russia - are rushing to put distance between them. Mr. Milosevic's power just might wither in the light of a new day.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As thousands rally nightly to demand his resignation, allies of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic are conducting an increasingly public campaign of intimidation, police harassment and economic blackmail against opposition leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across Serbia, authorities loyal to the Milosevic government have arrested some supporters of the pro-democracy Alliance for Change, threatened others with violence or fired them from state-controlled jobs and closed privately owned shops and restaurants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the campaign seemed to enter an ominous new phase as Milosevic's powerful wife, Mirjana Markovic, launched a fierce rhetorical attack against Alliance for Change leader Zoran Djindjic, branding him a traitorous &quot;puppet&quot; of the West and a NATO spy. Meanwhile, the commander of the Yugoslav army vowed to defend the country against &quot;various internal enemies.&quot; And a bomb exploded at the home of an opposition leader in the eastern town of Valjevo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasing animosity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming just two weeks after a suspected assassination attempt in which a truck loaded with sand plowed into a car carrying opposition leader Vuk Draskovic, the latest developments sent shock waves across Belgrade intellectual circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dissidents, journalists and other observers of the Milosevic government believe that Milosevic is nervously testing strategies to defuse calls for his resignation and for free and fair elections. Well-aware that a majority of Serbs would throw him out of office if given the chance to vote, analysts say Milosevic is disturbed by indications that opposition factions have coalesced around a plan to begin a coordinated push Thursday for early elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, Milosevic and his supporters appear to be carefully targeting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders in Belgrade and smaller communities as a way of intimidating others to stay home and keep their mouths shut. If that doesn't work, dissident leaders fear, the government may unleash a brutal police crackdown against the marchers who have gathered nightly in towns across Serbia for the past month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the night of long knives is waiting for us,&quot; said CedomirJovanovic, a top Alliance for Change organizer. &quot;They're waiting for the opportunity to use extreme violence in such a way as to horrify Serbian citizens&quot; into submission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving constantly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most wanted men in Serbia, Jovanovic, 28, is familiar with the regime's tactics. For the past two months, he has been sleeping in different apartments and switching cars during the day to avoid arrest by state security agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charged earlier this month with accepting cash from foreign intelligence agents and plotting to destroy the constitutional system, Jovanovic hides under disguises and appears in public escorted by a cadre of marchers. Asked what would happen if police found him, Jovanovic, a movie buff, replied: &quot;Midnight Express,&quot; a film that depicts vicious conditions in a Turkish prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic said he is under constant police surveillance. His motorcades have been searched repeatedly in recent days. Citing police and state security sources, Djindjic said his apartment building, its entrance and elevator and the surrounding streets have been photographed, his bodyguards have been quizzed about their weapons and the home of a friend has been filmed from a helicopter &quot;as if it were an enemy military object.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On another front, the printing house that publishes Alliance for Change posters and bulletins was hauled into court this week on 44 charges of printing a publication that is not officially registered. If convicted, ABC Grafika could face fines that would halt publication of independent news media such as Vreme, NIN and Glas Javnosti, as well as Alliance for Change documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation outside Belgrade is even bleaker. Take Leskovac, a southern Serbian town controlled by Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) where spontaneous protests erupted about a month after international peacekeeping forces entered Kosovo on July 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue in Leskovac -- ground zero of this year's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- was fury over the huge number of local men sent to fight in Kosovo. Nearly 70 percent of fighting-age men were mobilized in Leskovac, barely 20 miles from the Kosovo border. More than 80 of them died, though authorities admit to only 57.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 1, Ivan Novkovic, a technician at the SPS-controlled TV station, broadcast a diatribe against local SPS leaders during a championship basketball game between Yugoslavia and Germany. Four days later, 20,000 people -- the largest crowd ever to assemble in the town of 80,000 -- turned out to protest against local leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the rally, Novkovic and two other rally speakers were imprisoned for nearly a month. One of the speakers, Bratislav Stamenkovic, was fired from his job as a municipal development engineer. Last week, Novkovic also was fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of marchers in Leskovac has dwindled to 300, as those who take to the streets find themselves photographed and their jobs threatened by their employers -- all supporters of Milosevic's party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a lot of work to do and we have a very dangerous rival,&quot; said Stamenkovic, who spent 25 days in prison. &quot;The end is very close. But I'm afraid there will be a lot of wounded and dead before this is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Hundley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Belgrade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MORE than 100,000 Serbs turned out on a warm August evening to vent their frustration with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the man who has led their country to military defeat, economic ruin and international isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoran Djindjic, one of leading figures in Serbia's fractious opposition, issued an ultimatum to Milosevic: resign within 15 days or face daily demonstrations and prolonged nationwide strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This time we will carry on until the end,&quot; Mr Djindjic told the protesters. &quot;Either he goes or we do.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police kept a low profile, and the rally outside the Yugoslav parliament building remained peaceful. There were some tense moments, however, when a tear-gas grenade tossed into the densely packed crowd nearly caused a stampede.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally was organised by a newly formed group of independent economists who aim to create a transitional government of experts that would repair the economy, normalise relations with the West and prepare the country for internationally supervised elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time for Milosevic to go,&quot; said Milovan Pavlovic, a 71-year-old retired mechanic from southern Serbia, who travelled by bus to Belgrade to take part in the demonstration. He said he was disappointed by the turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was hoping for two or three million. These are dark days for Serbia and we will probably need a miracle to get rid of Milosevic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's demonstration was the first in the capital since the winter of 1996-97, when nearly three months of daily street protests against Milosevic ultimately failed because opposition leaders began bickering with each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the largest opposition party, is the most charismatic, erratic and perhaps mistrusted figure in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp. Two days before the Belgrade rally he withdrew as a speaker without explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were reports in the Belgrade media _ denied by Mr Draskovic _ of a secret meeting between him and Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But halfway through yesterday's rally, he suddenly and dramatically strode up to the speaker's platform, touching off a brief scuffle between his bodyguards and those of arch-rival Mr Djindjic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His theatrical appearance touched off loud jeers and cries of &quot;traitor,&quot; which were quickly drowned out by ecstatic chants of &quot;Vuk, Vuk&quot; from supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia yesterday threatened to withdraw its troops from the Kosovo peacekeeping force, complaining that it did not want to be associated with an operation that it believed NATO was mismanaging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If KFOR activities take on a certain character, then Russia's association with such activities will not be possible,&quot; the Interfax news agency quoted defence and foreign ministry officials as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said the KFOR force was not abiding by United Nations resolutions, a reference to provisions calling for the protection of Serbs and the disarming of ethnic Albanian fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PROMINENT Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic has alleged he was the victim of an assassination attempt in a car crash yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four of his team died in the crash, which followed the car he was in swerving off the road to avoid hitting a truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The car in which Draskovic's security team was travelling hit the truck head-on, one of Draskovic's advisers said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Draskovic, president of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO), told Studio B television that the crash was an &quot;obvious assassination attempt&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are talking about an obvious assassination attempt and, with God's will, everybody was killed but myself,&quot; he said. &quot;Let those who carried it out reflect well on what will happen to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The alleged assassination attempt came as mass demonstrations against the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic took place throughout Serbia for the 13th consecutive day, bringing tens of thousands of people on to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Draskovic was slightly injured in the accident, near Lazarevac, 40km south of Belgrade, his party said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Killed were his security chief, two other members of the security team and his brother-in-law, an official in the Belgrade municipality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The truck suddenly, without any reason . . . switched to our side of the road and it was clear to me that it had intended to kill me,&quot; Draskovic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Borivoje Borovic, a lawyer and member of the SPO's directorate, said the road was straight and not slippery, with good visibility. &quot;The truck driver disappeared,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An investigating magistrate said the truck had been on the wrong side of the road at the time of the collision &quot;for reasons yet unknown&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally organised by the opposition coalition Alliance for Change, a minute's silence was held in honour of the killed SPO officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of a disagreement over strategy, the SPO does not participate in the alliance's daily protests aimed at ousting Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the mass protests continued, police cordons restricted a march by 15,000 people through the centre of Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police directed the crowd back to a square where the demonstration had started. There were no reports of violent incidents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition analysts gave the rally mixed reviews. The good news was the impressive size of the crowd in this politically jaded city. The bad news is that the opposition showed itself to be as split as ever.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State television gave prominent coverage to the tossing of a teargas canister into the crowd at the start of the protest as well as on-stage scuffling between rival parties' security guards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A newscaster claimed the demonstration was planned weeks ago by the US envoy to the Balkans, Robert Gelbard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government's daily paper, Politika, buried news of the rally and estimated crowd size at only 25,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crowd of 150,000 was considered a strong showing for Belgrade. While the capital is firmly controlled by the opposition, as are all of Serbia's larger towns, citizens have grown weary of demonstrating against the president, Slobodan Milosevic, for ten years with nothing to show for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The size of the crowd was a good sign. It was clearly an expression of disappointment with the government,&quot; said Dragoljub Micunovic, president of the Democratic Centre and a federal MP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Citizens also took advantage of every opportunity to chant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> epithets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the sobering news was the old rivalries exposed at the podium. One group is planning simultaneous protests across Serbia in a bid to force out Mr Milosevic, while the other will press for early elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vuk Draskovic's Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to negotiate internationally monitored elections with the Milosevic government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That proposal was jeered at the rally, but recent polls indicate Mr Draskovic is Serbia's most popular leader, with 18 per cent support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic's Socialist Party received a 13.7 per cent approval rating, while his wife's United Yugoslav Left received a 2.5 per cent rating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Alliance for Change, the Serbian Orthodox Church and a group of economists and professionals called G17 are sticking with the Stability Pact for Serbia, a document demanding the resignation of Mr Milosevic followed by a year-long transition government of experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The idea is to set politics aside temporarily to pull Serbia out of its economic isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic Party and key alliance member, gave Mr Milosevic an ultimatum: &quot;Either resign in 15 days or we'll remove you. It's either him or us. There is no middle ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Djindjic and his allies will lead protests in &quot;50 cities and towns&quot; across Serbia, accompanied by strikes and civil disobedience, until Mr Milosevic agrees to bow out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Djindjic drew wild cheers in cosmopolitan Belgrade, but he is an urban candidate with scant support among farmers and factory workers. His party received a 10 per cent showing in recent polls, just trailing Milosevic's Socialists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Djindjic's party is by far the strongest in Alliance for Change. But without Mr Draskovic's support, analysts say the alliance's civil disobedience campaign will not be much of a threat. Yet Mr Djindjic is betting that deep and mounting economic frustration will pull Serbs on to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The alliance feels that fair elections are not possible with Mr Milosevic at the helm.Mr Draskovic, on the other hand, knows fair elections could put him in power. But he set conditions for early elections: state media must be open to the opposition, and voting must be monitored by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic's Socialist Party recently announced it would go to elections if that is what the opposition wants, but whether it would meet Mr Draskovic's demands remains unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbia's and Yugoslavia's ruling coalition is made up of Vojislav Seselj's Radical nationalists, and the parties of Mr Milosevic and his wife. Polling data suggests only a united opposition could beat that coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Djindjic's street protests could quickly turn violent, as the Alliance for Change has been branded &quot;a terrorist organisation&quot; by state media and government leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adding to the uncertainty are rumours that many in Mr Milosevic's ranks are thinking of turning against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In private conversation, powerful people in the Socialist Party are expressing their dissatisfaction,&quot; said Mr Micunovic. &quot;That has never happened before.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the NATO alliance presses its bombing campaign against Slobodan Milosevic's military machine in Yugoslavia, an intense propaganda war is also raging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a televised address to the Serbian people March 25, U.S. President Bill Clinton claimed that the United States and its allies &quot;have no quarrel with the Serbian people.&quot; He identified Milosevic as the culprit responsible for the diminished and isolated position of Serbia and for forcing Serbia's sons to fight in a &quot;senseless conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright reinforced that, &quot;Americans do not hate Serbs.&quot; She added that the Serb people have not been &quot;accurately informed&quot; about the Kosovo peace settlement based on the Rambouillet accords; an agreement that would help build democracy for every ethnic group in Kosovo. Serbian leaders, she warned, must accept the peace plan and allow the deployment in Kosovo of a NATO-led peace implementation force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such sentiments offered cold comfort to most Serbs, who regard Kosovo as the cradle of their cultural identity, and who dread the prospect of Albanian political hegemony in the region. But even more catastrophic for the Serbian people is the idea that Kosovo could be occupied by an external military force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A majority of Serbs staunchly oppose Milosevic's authoritarian regime. However, the majority (including the weak and divided domestic opposition) strongly resent foreign dictates regarding which political values and models they should espouse, when and how Serbs should depose their political leaders and how Serbia should respond to an internal secessionist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this context, Clinton's explanation that the Kosovar Albanians insisted on the deployment of NATO peacekeeping forces in Kosovo only heightens Serbian paranoia, while the president's claim those troops would not constitute &quot;some occupying force&quot; is viewed as sheer deceit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true NATO leaders conducted seemingly endless negotiations with Milosevic and promised to maintain Yugoslavia's current borders. But the key provision of the plan presented to the Serbian regime -- that was offered on a take-it or leave-it-and-be-bombed basis -- included the presence of a 28, 000-strong NATO force on Yugoslav territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Rambouillet and Paris negotiations more than 1,200 civilian &quot;verification monitors&quot; were already present in Kosovo, and the fighting had diminished compared to the earlier period or what has followed since the current NATO bombing campaign. Expanding such a civilian force, protected by NATO troops in Macedonia, might have provided a more acceptable alternative for implementing a negotiated political agreement for Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A European protection force with OSCE monitors could have been another viable option. But NATO rejected such plans, preferring instead the Bosnian model of peace enforcement, where a large NATO- led military force &quot;protects&quot; a comprehensive civilian implementation program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kosovo is not Bosnia, not to mention part of a sovereign country. Uncompromisingly employing a cookie-cutter approach to resolve conflicts within each complex Balkan sub-region is hopelessly misguided. And, as now is tragically evident in Kosovo, can even make a bad situation worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is certainly a &quot;moral imperative&quot; to relieving humanitarian disasters and preventing atrocities, such as those resulting from the brutal struggle between Yugoslav security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army. But the present oxymoronic NATO policy of &quot;humanitarian bombing&quot; is hardly the way to deliver short-term emergency assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasing numbers of Albanians have now become refugees and targets of Serbian anger. Even </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbs are now deeply offended by the resolve of the international community to bomb their country to force acceptance of a NATO-led peacekeeping protectorate on their soil. Ironically, the same young Serbs who became politically conscious in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests now vent their frustration in opposition to NATO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the goal of the international community is to alleviate both Albanian and Serb suffering in Kosovo, preserve the Yugoslav borders, and repair Serb-Albanian relations, the bombing campaign of Serbia in order to politically target Milosevic is clearly the wrong way to go about it. Some advocates of NATO's aerial assault are now calling for direct &quot; forced entry&quot; by NATO ground troops, or foreign arming of the Kosovar Albanians. Such proposals would only serve to broaden the conflict and compound NATO's original misguided approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dream of most Albanians in Kosovo is to achieve political independence. This includes eventual union with Albania proper, and with other Albanian populations in neighbouring states. That yearning has now intensified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the core of Serbian opposition to the take-it-or-leave-it peace settlement is the fear that the Rambouillet accords and the presence of NATO troops in Kosovo would encourage Kosovar Albanian separation and state-building dreams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of Yugoslavia's neighbours, such as fragile Macedonia (at least its 65-70 per cent non- Albanian citizens), Greece and Bulgaria exhibit similar angst with respect to the destabilizing potential of such &quot;greater&quot; Albanian aspirations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A publicly stated goal of NATO bombing is to force Serb acceptance of the present peace settlement signed by the Albanian side in Paris. But the alliance's unspoken agenda is to emulate the Dayton model used for Bosnia and Herzegovina; that is, the creation of another international protectorate in the Balkans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a NATO-run entity is viewed not only as a way to unseat Milosevic and blunt Serbian &quot;aggression,&quot; but also a means to prevent the formation of a large ethnic Albanian state. Today NATO is ostensibly bombing the Serbs to protect Kosovo's Albanians. Tomorrow alliance forces will likely be required to deter state-building efforts by the Kosovo Liberation Army and other militant Albanians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO's political and military leaders have studiously avoided raising any other alternatives, such as peacefully negotiating border changes or partition of the countries in the area, for fear that any territorial reconfiguration -- for example, of Kosovo or Macedonia -- would encourage similar initiatives in ethnically segmented Bosnia and Herzegovina. By &quot;degrading&quot; Milosevic's military, NATO hopes to clear the way for the alliance to shape the political future of southeastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what is termed military force serving diplomacy is essentially force serving problematic political goals. After Dayton and the experience of the past few years in Bosnia, NATO has developed a template for what it considers to be the proper political architecture and behaviour for people in Europe's less stable regions. The result of such a policy will encourage the incremental expansion of a very expensive and protracted chain of protectorates throughout the Balkans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As NATO moves ahead with its latest Balkan venture, the citizens and policy-makers in NATO states could profitably ask themselves some serious questions regarding current alliance strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, do we really want to establish a network of expensive and long-term protectorates in southeastern Europe? Can such military-backed protectorates really foster &quot;self-sustaining&quot; multiethnic states and democratic self-governance? Should NATO bomb all countries where armed separatist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have engendered a brutal response from incumbent state leaders who belong to the dominant ethnic group? Should we attack foreign countries if they are unwilling to grant international officials working in protectorates near imperiatorial powers to induce what they consider to be acceptable patterns of political behaviour?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such issues will remain pertinent beyond the political life of Slobodan Milosevic and the current bombing campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point, it would be prudent to suspend the bombing of Yugoslavia (as part of a mutual ceasefire), and to take another look at whether the proposed Kosovo peace settlement can effectively address not only the &quot;Serbian question,&quot; but also the &quot;Albanian question&quot; in southeastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For better or worse, Slobodan Milosevic is now fully aware that NATO threats are credible. However, the broader interests of the countries in the alliance require consideration of alternatives to bombing as a methodology for negotiating Balkan stability, and to the proliferation of NATO-backed international protectorates in the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Students in Nis said on Tuesday the people had to choose between Serbia or Mr Milosevic, and the city council of Novi Sad accused the President of &quot;catastrophic foreign and domestic policy&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the southern Serbian town of Uzice, former Belgrade mayor Zoran Djindjic led an anti-government rally to warn of civil war if Mr Milosevic stays, while in Leskovac about 1500 people clashed with riot police following the jailing of a television engineer who had interrupted broadcasts to call for an opposition protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some protesters attacked the house of a local official of Mr Milosevic's Socialist Party, smashing windows and breaking down the fence in protest at the 30-day sentence for Ivan Novkovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Djindjic, the head of the Serbian Democratic Party, told about 5000 people in Uzice that Serbia was heading for a civil war unless Mr Milosevic went.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking in public for the first time since fleeing Serbia in fear for his life six weeks ago, Mr Djindjic called in his Uzice speech for people to have courage and push for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Every day, in every town, we have to get out in the streets&quot; until Mr Milosevic is dismissed, Mr Djindjic said, describing him as &quot;the worst and the most incapable leader the world has ever seen&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Djindjic urged the people to &quot;transform&quot; their dissatisfaction to &quot;a general people's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aimed at freeing the Serbian people from slavery&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You should be ready, it will be a long summer but it will be followed by freedom,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Demonstrators will be bussed from Belgrade to the central Serbian town of Cacak, where a crowd of up to 25,000 will try to launch a campaign of country -wide street protests calling for Mr Milosevic's resignation and free elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Failure to mobilise high attendance could further undermine opposition unity, consolidating the shaky regime.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mayor of Cacak, Velimir Ilic, is expected to come out of hiding to speak. He is wanted on criminal charges for organising an anti-government rally during the war in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zoran Djindjic, leader of the Democratic party and a potential challenger to Mr Milosevic, is expected to return from his tour of Europe. He claimed at the weekend that Mr Milosevic had been offered asylum in China if ousted, so he could avoid prosecution by the war crimes tribunal in the Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Alliance for Change, an umbrella group of 30 opposition parties, chose Cacak as a hotbed of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sentiment. Hopes of joining forces with 3,000 soldiers protesting about unpaid wages in nearby towns faded yesterday when the reservists melted away after a general toured their blockades handing out cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rally will breach a ban on protests, in force despite last week's decision to lift the state of war. Alliance leaders said they were prepared to go to jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their morale was boosted at Saturday's Yugoslav football cup final when Red Star Belgrade's stadium resounded to the chants: 'Slobo resign', and 'Slobo, you sold Kosovo'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But opposition rifts have undermined their chances of tapping such hostility. Vuk Draskovic, popular head of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will not attend the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ljubodrag Stojadinovic, who headed the army press office, said Mr Milosevic was unlikely to send in police. 'It's hard to believe there'll be enough people there to shake him. People are fed up, but things are returning to normal. They don't want violence or revolution. Elections in the autumn are the most likely next step.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No one questioned in Belgrade's streets planned to attend. 'You expect me to drive down there for three hours so I can shout about Slobo and achieve precisely nothing? No thanks,' said one man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Serbian Orthodox church is understood to have chosen Thursday as the day to speak out about Serb atrocities in Kosovo. Its head, Patriarch Pavle, has returned from the province shocked by what he saw. He has instructed priests to relay the message that the country needs to atone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A TENSE calm returned to the streets of Belgrade yesterday after police arrested and severely beat the leader of Serbia's largest opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> following a riot outside the Yugoslav parliament in which one policeman was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An Interior Ministry statement said Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was arrested after he assaulted a policeman in a struggle outside the parliament between police and several thousand protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic's wife, Danica, who was arrested but allowed one telephone call, said she watched as police dragged her husband around a courtyard of Belgrade's main police station by his feet after his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition leader was admitted to hospital overnight for facial surgery after his ordeal in the police station. A doctor who treated him said Mr Draskovic suffered head fractures, lost some teeth, could not speak or stand up and appeared to be suffering from internal bleeding. Although doctors protested he was not fit to move, the police dragged Mr Draskovic out of his bed and took him back to prison as soon as the operation was over.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police arrested Mr Draskovic at 1am yesterday after enraged demonstrators, shouting slogans against the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, attempted to storm the parliament. Tempers are running high among Serbia's impoverished population, and for some the beating-up of a deputy from Mr Draskovic's party inside the parliament by a member of the ultra-nationalist Radical Party was the final straw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Riot police flooded the city centre, fired rounds of tear gas and repeatedly baton-charged the crowd, which hurled stones at the parliament and smashed windows and streetlamps. One policeman was hit and died yesterday of brain injuries. Dozens of demonstrators were injured. The police made more than 120 arrests. Mr and Mrs Draskovic called on the youthful crowd to disperse and stage a peaceful protest the following day. They retired to party headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there was to be no protest. In the early hours of the morning, riot police surrounded the headquarters building and a posse of 40 moved in. The Draskovics were led away in handcuffs. Police lined the entrance to the building. Eye-witnesses said they gave him a savage beating as he ran the gauntlet from the building to a waiting police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Staff at Mr Draskovic's headquarters said the police arrested 30 party officials at the same time. ''The police were armed to the teeth with machine guns, pistols, gas masks and wore flak-jackets - they looked like real dogs of war,'' said Blagica Stojanovic, a party spokeswoman. ''When we demanded to see their warrants they just laughed. They said they belonged to the Special Intervention Brigade and did not need warrants.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic, 47, has long been a thorn in the side of Mr Milosevic and his ruling Serbian Socialist Party. While Serbia's other opposition hummed and hawed about the brutal war in Croatia and Bosnia, the charismatic writer-turned-politician focused his considerable wit on Serbia's leaders and Mr Milosevic in particular, calling them bandits and thugs who dragged Serbia's name through the mud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vuk Draskovic started in politics in the mid-eighties as a nationalist opponent of Communist rule. He espoused a Greater Serbia under a restored monarchy. His was a nave Balkan dream of a democratic land of prosperous peasants, jolly priests, wise kings. With his long hair, hypnotic eyes and richly timbred voice, he looked like a Serbian Rasputin. He loved to doodle maps of Serbia's future borders and to muse about a great future federation of Eastern Orthodox countries stretching from Belgrade to Moscow. He was inconsistent on most points and consistent only in voicing ribald contempt for Mr Milosevic. Loathed by many Serbs as a traitor, he had a core of dedicated followers in Belgrade and in the Serbian countryside, who regarded him as little less than a messiah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the failure of a big </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstration in Belgrade which he led in March 1991, he became a marginalised figure. But Mr Milosevic never forgot or forgave his most trenchant critic. His opposition to the war in Bosnia and Croatia made him dangerous, and there was always the fear in government circles that he might one day act as a catalyst for a future revolt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently he appeared embittered, accusing Western countries of propping up Mr Milosevic and of giving in to him in Bosnia. He foresaw Serbia's descent into a whirlpool of violence. At his last press conference he said more protests would soon shake Serbia and they would end in bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the time he was accused of inciting a civil war. In retrospect he was just prophetic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">declined to be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;&quot;He only had one chance at his demonstration and he blew it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;&quot;Now all his people have gone home and I don't think they'll come</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days before a major anti-government rally in Belgrade, a key protest leader said he would not attend, and a top general warned the army would intervene in case of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surprise announcement Tuesday by opposition leader Vuk Draskovic was a blow to attempts to form a united front to demand the resignation of President Slobodan Milosevic. Draskovic has led the biggest protests against the president.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest rally Thursday in Belgrade would be the first major gathering in the capital since weeks of anti-government protests in 1996-97. It is expected to be a test of the public's discontent with Milosevic, and its readiness to trust opposition leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic and political crisis in Serbia, already deep after years of international isolation and wars, has intensified since the NATO bombing, which ended in June. Serbs increasingly blame Milosevic's policies for the worsening situation in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's government has toughened its position lately toward the growing opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and harsh oral attacks against opposition leaders have appeared daily in the state-run media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgrade police Tuesday arrested and beat up an anti-government activist, Bogoljub Arsenijevic, from central Serbia. He went into hiding after leading thousands of rock-throwing followers in a raid on a government building in his native Valjevo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic told the newspaper Glas on Tuesday that &quot;the army has to stand between the divided people to prevent civil war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The army will not stand against people, but (against) all those telling various stories, those who want to come to power illegitimately,&quot; Pavkovic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic led protests in 1991 and afterward spent several days in jail. He was also one of the leaders of weeks </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations in 1996-97.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he later moved closer to Milosevic and served as deputy premier in the Yugoslav government before being sacked during the NATO bombing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roundup of main news</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The headline, &quot;They were preparing to set Malesija on fire&quot;, covers half of the daily's front-page and refers to a report on yesterday's press conference organized by the Montenegrin police. The police officials discussed the recent arrest of a group of Albanians who are accused of preparing terrorist actions. According to the report, they also presented a number of seized rifles, anti-tank rocket launchers, mines and other explosive devices</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the headline, &quot;Milo is a bit tired&quot;, the daily carries news agency reports about Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic saying that he is considering plans to withdraw from political life.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another report analyses the election results and says that many unionists and some pro-independence voters have decided to support the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for Change, or PZP, while it appears that some of the unionist voters actually voted for the ruling coalition. The report adds that about 40,000 unionist voters abstained from voting. The paper carries a report on the OSCE monitoring mission saying that the elections were mostly democratic. However, the OSCE observers warn that the elections were marred by new restrictive regulations and certain vote-buying incidents, particularly those in the northern Montenegrin town of Berane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another report says that an Egyptian Navy delegation has arrived in Tivat, Montenegrin coastal town, and visited surplus Montenegrin Navy ships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POBJEDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roundup of main news</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main front-page headline, &quot;The people of Montenegro can be proud of such elections&quot;, introduces a report on the OSCE monitoring mission saying that the Montenegrin elections were in line with the Council of Europe and OSCE standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another prominent headline, &quot;Opposition says that the people failed&quot;, refers to a report on initial reactions to the election results. The report quotes political analyst Dusan Janjic as saying that the Socialist People's Party, or SNP, might not survive the most recent defeat and that its leader Predrag Bulatovic is finding it increasingly difficult to manage such an outmoded party. Anther political expert, Vladimir Goati, says that the success of the PZP is the greatest election surprise but that this party needs to set up a serious infrastructure as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining prominent headline, &quot;'Eagle's Flight' operation conducted right on time&quot;, refers to a report on the arrest of the group of Albanians accused of preparing terrorist attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roundup of main news</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The largest front-page headline, &quot;Djukanovic: I am leaving&quot;, refers to news agency reports on Prime Minister Djukanovic saying that he is growing tired of the political life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the headline, &quot;Bulatovic: America was offering me the post of leader&quot;, the daily carries a report on former Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic presenting his new book in Kragujevac, city in Serbia. Bulatovic commented about recent political events and said that the USA had offered him to lead the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opposition in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The daily also carries several reports on the election results and points out that the villagers of Vir near Niksic, town in central Montenegro, overwhelmingly voted for the ruling coalition, despite the fact that a depot explosion recently practically destroyed their village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REPUBLIKA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roundup of main news</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another report on the election results dominates the front page of the daily and says that this was a clear victory of the Democratic Party of Socialists - Social Democratic Party, or DPS-SDP, coalition. According to the report, the SNP is, following a decade of rivalry, no longer the main opponent of the ruling parties. While the PZP did not manage to recruit a significant number of the ruling coalition voters, the report adds, it managed to convince moderate unionists to support them, while the Serbian List took over the pro-union hardliners. The SNP now has only two options - to become a European party or to disappear, the report concludes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, the daily quotes the DPS and SDP spokesmen as saying that their voters did not support the PZP and that this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> managed to recruit only former opposition supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another report, Ferhat Dinosa, chairman of the Democratic Union of Albanians, or DUA, says that the recent arrest of the group of Albanians in Malesija is not an action aimed against all the Albanians. The report adds that, according to rumours, Dinosa was one of the group's targets.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a softly lit conference room, American pollster Doug Schoen flashed the results of an in-depth opinion poll of 840 Serbian voters onto an overhead projection screen, sketching a strategy for toppling Europe's last remaining communist-era ruler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His message, delivered to leaders of Serbia's traditionally fractious opposition, was simple and powerful. Slobodan Milosevic--survivor of four lost wars, two major street uprisings, 78 days of NATO bombing and a decade of international sanctions--was &quot;completely vulnerable&quot; to a well-organized electoral challenge. The key, the poll results showed, was opposition unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Held in a luxury hotel in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, in October 1999, the closed-door briefing by Schoen, a Democrat, turned out to be a seminal event, pointing the way to the electoral revolution that brought down Milosevic a year later. It also marked the start of an extraordinary U.S. effort to unseat a foreign head of state, not through covert action of the kind the CIA once employed in such places as Iran and Guatemala, but by modern election campaign techniques.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the broad outlines of the $ 41 million U.S. democracy-building campaign in Serbia are public knowledge, interviews with dozens of key players, both here and in the United States, suggest it was much more extensive and sophisticated than previously reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 12 months following the strategy session, U.S.-funded consultants played a crucial role behind the scenes in virtually every facet of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> drive, running tracking polls, training thousands of opposition activists and helping to organize a vitally important parallel vote count. U.S. taxpayers paid for 5,000 cans of spray paint used by student activists to scrawl </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> graffiti on walls across Serbia, and 2.5 million stickers with the slogan &quot;He's Finished,&quot; which became the revolution's catchphrase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarded by many as Eastern Europe's last great democratic upheaval, Milosevic's overthrow may also go down in history as the first poll-driven, focus group-tested revolution. Behind the seeming spontaneity of the street uprising that forced Milosevic to respect the results of a hotly contested presidential election on Sept. 24 was a carefully researched strategy put together by Serbian democracy activists with the active assistance of Western advisers and pollsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the long run, many people here say, Milosevic's overthrow was inevitable, if only because of the economic and military disasters that befell Serbia during his 13 years in power, first as head of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, and then as head of Yugoslavia itself. But there was nothing inevitable about the timing or the manner of his departure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without American support, it would have been much more difficult,&quot; said Slobodan Homen, a student leader who traveled to Budapest and other European capitals dozens of times to meet with U.S. officials and private democracy consultants. &quot;There would have been a revolution anyway, but the assistance helped us avoid bloodshed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The foreign support was critical,&quot; agreed Milan Stevanovic, who oversaw the marketing and message development campaign for the opposition coalition, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia. &quot;In the past, we did what we intuitively thought we should do. This was the first campaign where our strategy was based on real scientific research.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had Yugoslavia been a totalitarian state like Iraq or North Korea, the strategy would have stood little chance. But while Milosevic ran a repressive police state, he was never a dictator in the style of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. His authority depended on a veil of popular legitimacy. It was this constitutional facade that gave Serbian opposition leaders, and their Western backers, an all-important opening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Unified Opposition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fall of 1999 was a difficult time for the Serbian opposition. Although Milosevic had long been unpopular, he appeared to have had some success in tapping into the upsurge of patriotic feeling caused by the Kosovo war a few months before. The 59-year-old Yugoslav president was seeking to depict himself as the rebuilder of the country following NATO bombing raids. Attempts by some opposition parties to topple Milosevic through street protests were getting nowhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's strongest political card was the disarray and ineffectiveness of his opponents. The opposition consisted of nearly two dozen political parties, some of whose leaders were barely on speaking terms with one another. While the opposition politicians recognized the need for unity in theory, in practice they were deeply divided, both on the tactics to use against Milosevic and the question of who should succeed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was against this background that 20 opposition leaders accepted an invitation from the Washington-based National Democratic Institute (NDI) in October 1999 to a seminar at the Marriott Hotel in Budapest, overlooking the Danube River. The key item on the agenda: an opinion poll commissioned by the U.S. polling firm Penn, Schoen &amp; Berland Associates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll reported that Milosevic had a 70 percent unfavorable rating among Serbian voters. But it also showed that the big names in the opposition--men such as Zoran Djindjic and Vuk Draskovic--were burdened with negative poll ratings almost as high as Milosevic's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the candidates best placed to challenge Milosevic, the poll suggested, was a moderate Serbian nationalist named Vojislav Kostunica, who had a favorable rating of 49 percent and an unfavorable rating of only 29 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schoen, who had provided polling advice to former Yugoslav prime minister Milan Panic during his unsuccessful 1992 campaign to depose Milosevic, drew several conclusions from these and other findings of the poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, Serbian voters were receptive to simple </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> messages focusing on the terrible economic situation. Second, they wanted change to come through the ballot box, not demonstrations. Finally, and most important, only a united opposition had a chance of deposing Milosevic. &quot;If you take one word from this conference,&quot; Schoen told the delegates, &quot;I urge it to be unity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unity message did not catch on immediately with Serbian opposition leaders. &quot;They had seen Milosevic rise before,&quot; recalled Debra Alexander, who was in charge of the National Democratic Institute polling operation. &quot;There was a sense they were going up against insuperable odds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the following months, however, the opposition politicians came to believe the polling evidence and shape a strategy for defeating Milosevic with the help of the Western consultants. Djindjic, leader of the largest, best-organized opposition party, agreed to set aside his presidential ambitions in favor of a less polarizing candidate and serve as coalition campaign manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things moved into high gear in July, when Milosevic called elections. For the first time in Serbian political history, Western advertising techniques were used to test political messages. The messages were tested in a similar way to soft drinks or chewing gum, according to Srdan Bogosavljevic, head of the Strategic Marketing firm, which ran a series of focus groups on behalf of the opposition coalition and the Otpor student resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with financial support from Western democracy groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We approached the process with a brand to sell and a brand to beat,&quot; said Bogosavljevic, one of Serbia's best known pollsters. &quot;The brand to sell was Kostunica. The brand to beat was Milosevic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Stevanovic, the coalition marketing expert, every word of the opposition's one-minute and five-minute core political messages used by opposition spokesmen across the country was discussed with U.S. consultants and tested by opinion poll. Coalition candidates running for the Yugoslav parliament and tens of thousands of local government positions received extensive training on how to stay &quot;on message,&quot; answer journalists' questions and rebut the arguments of Milosevic supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visa restrictions imposed by the Milosevic government made it impossible for the U.S. consultants to travel to Serbia, so they organized a series of &quot;train the trainers&quot; sessions in Hungary and Montenegro. The trainers then went back to Serbia to spread the word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica's selection as the opposition presidential candidate in August was shaped, in large measure, by the opinion polls. &quot;The polls showed that Kostunica could defeat Milosevic in the easiest possible way,&quot; recalled Dusan Mihajlovic, leader of the New Democracy party, one of 18 political parties that made up the coalition. Part of Kostunica's appeal, the polls showed, was that he was widely perceived as anti-American. Because he was an outspoken critic of the NATO bombing of Serbia, it was difficult for the Milosevic government to label him a Western stooge or a traitor to Serbian interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica was also the one opposition leader strongly opposed to accepting U.S. campaign assistance. &quot;I was against it, never got any myself, and thought it was unnecessary,&quot; he said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To many opposition activists, Kostunica's denials ring a little hollow. While it is true that his own party, the Democratic Party of Serbia, rejected anything that smacked of U.S. aid, his presidential campaign benefited enormously from the advice and financial support the opposition coalition received from abroad, and particularly from the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lessons in Resistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. democracy-building effort in Serbia was a curious mixture of secrecy and openness. In principle, it was an overt operation, funded by congressional appropriations of around $ 10 million for fiscal 1999 and $ 31 million for 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Americans involved in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> effort said they were aware of CIA activity at the fringes of the campaign, but had trouble finding out what the agency was up to. Whatever it was, they concluded it was not particularly effective. The lead role was taken by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government's foreign assistance agency, which channeled the funds through commercial contractors and nonprofit groups such as NDI and its Republican counterpart, the International Republican Institute (IRI).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While NDI worked closely with Serbian opposition parties, IRI focused its attention on Otpor, which served as the revolution's ideological and organizational backbone. In March, IRI paid for two dozen Otpor leaders to attend a seminar on nonviolent resistance at the Hilton Hotel in Budapest, a few hundreds yards along the Danube from the NDI-favored Marriott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the seminar, the Serbian students received training in such matters as how to organize a strike, how to communicate with symbols, how to overcome fear and how to undermine the authority of a dictatorial regime. The principal lecturer was retired U.S. Army Col. Robert Helvey, who has made a study of nonviolent resistance methods around the world, including those used in modern-day Burma and the civil rights struggle in the American South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What was most amazing to us was to discover that what we were trying to do spontaneously in Serbia was supported by a whole nonviolent system that we knew nothing about,&quot; said Srdja Popovic, a former biology student. &quot;This was the first time we thought about this in a systematic, scientific way. We said to ourselves, 'We will go back and apply this.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helvey, who served two tours in Vietnam, introduced the Otpor activists to the ideas of American theoretician Gene Sharpe, whom he describes as &quot;the Clausewitz of the nonviolence </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; referring to the renowned Prussian military strategist. Six months later, Popovic can recite Helvey's lectures almost word for word, beginning with the dictum, &quot;Removing the authority of the ruler is the most important element in nonviolent struggle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those Serbs really impressed me,&quot; Helvey said in an interview from his West Virginia home. &quot;They were very bright, very committed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in Serbia, Otpor activists set about undermining Milosevic's authority by all means available. Rather than simply daubing slogans on walls, they used a wide range of sophisticated public relations techniques, including polling, leafleting and paid advertising. &quot;The poll results were very important,&quot; recalled Ivo Andric, a marketing student at Belgrade University. &quot;At every moment, we knew what to say to the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll results pointed to a paradox that went to the heart of Milosevic's grip on power. On one hand, the Yugoslav president was detested by 70 percent of the electorate. On the other, a majority of Serbs believed he would continue to remain in power, even after an election. To topple Milosevic, opposition leaders first had to convince their fellow Serbs that he could be overthrown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a brainstorming session last July, Otpor activist Srdjan Milivojevic murmured the words &quot;Gotov je,&quot; or &quot;He's finished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We realized immediately that it summed up our entire campaign,&quot; said Dejan Randjic, who ran the Otpor marketing operation. &quot;It was very simple, very powerful. It focused on Milosevic, but did not even mention him by name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next three months, millions of &quot;Gotov je&quot; stickers were printed on 80 tons of imported adhesive paper--paid for by USAID and delivered by the Washington-based Ronco Consulting Corp.--and plastered all over Serbia on walls, inside elevators and across Milosevic's campaign posters. Printed in black and white and accompanied by Otpor's clenched-fist emblem, they became the symbol of the revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Fair Vote Count</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had Yugoslav border officials been paying attention last summer, they would have observed an extraordinary increase in the number of Serbian students visiting a revered Serbian shrine in southern Hungary. &quot;Making a pilgrimage to Saint Andrija&quot; became the favorite excuse for opposition activists en route to another U.S.-funded program, this one in the Hungarian town of Szeged, just 10 minutes' drive from the Serbian border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its purpose was to train election observers. &quot;We set up mock polling stations with ballot boxes and went through the balloting process in detail with them,&quot; recalled John Anelli of the Republican institute, describing what became a key component in Milosevic's downfall. &quot;We trained about 400 election monitors who went back to Serbia and trained another 15,000 monitors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without a massive monitoring operation, and an equally massive parallel vote count organized by the Serbian Center for Free Elections and Democracy, this fall's effort to unseat Milosevic would almost certainly have failed. Opposition parties suspected him of stealing previous elections, most notably in 1997, but were unable to offer conclusive proof. This time, they made sure they had the means to detect election fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drawing on their experience of elections in such places as Indonesia and Mozambique, IRI consultants simulated vote-counting scams and ballot-stuffing techniques. &quot;They trained us to spot fraud and react quickly,&quot; said Goran Rapoti, an opposition election monitor from the town of Backa Palanka, who attended the seminar. &quot;It was really useful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States paid for the training in Szeged and the second level of training back in Serbia. By Election Day, the opposition parties were able to place at least two trained monitors at every polling station in the country. Each monitor received about $ 5 in Western-provided money, a significant sum in a country where the average monthly wage is less than $ 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without the monitors, Milosevic's people would have stolen the elections again,&quot; said Alexander Trkulja, the coalition campaign manager in Backa Palanka. &quot;They are masters in stealing elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An iron rule for both the coalition and Otpor was never to talk about Western financial or logistical support. To have done so would have played straight into the hands of the Milosevic propaganda machine, which routinely depicted opposition leaders as &quot;traitors&quot; or &quot;NATO lackeys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was dangerous to be connected publicly with the American authorities,&quot; said Randjic, the Otpor activist, recalling a 12-hour police interrogation in which he was grilled about his &quot;Washington controllers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even today, nearly two months after Milosevic's fall, the topic is sensitive. Although the U.S. effort was clearly aimed at Milosevic, the Clinton administration prefers to depict it as a neutral democracy-building operation. &quot;Our job was to level the playing field,&quot; said Paul Rowland, head of the Democratic institute's Serbia program. &quot;We worked with parties that wanted to make Serbia a genuine democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbian opposition leaders, meanwhile, view the U.S. support as atonement for past mistakes. They note that for many years U.S. officials treated the Yugoslav president as the linchpin of America's Balkan diplomacy, an indispensable interlocutor for Bosnia peace negotiator Richard C. Holbrooke and other high-level emissaries. Far from undermining Milosevic's grip on power, U.S. policy had actually served to strengthen it, they contend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the past, we had the impression that the West was supporting Milosevic,&quot; said Homen, a 28-year-old lawyer who served as Otpor's intermediary with Western diplomats and aid organizations. &quot;This was the first time that we felt that Western governments were actually trying to get rid of Milosevic.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Yugoslav government will today introduce a package of economic measures to combat spiralling inflation caused by the imposition of United Nations sanctions, which are rapidly bringing the country to its knees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But leading Belgrade economists hold out little hope for the strategy, claiming the federation's industrial and commercial decline is virtually irreversible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main plank of the government's anti-inflation plan, in the face of price rises which exceeded 100 per cent last month, is the devaluation of the Yugoslav dinar. The cost of many basic foodstuffs will be frozen and salaries adjusted so that the highest will be only three times greater than the minimum wage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The influential Belgrade weekly, Ekonomska Politika, poured scorn on the measures, saying they will result in Yugoslavia becoming a command economy by the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The magazine concluded the package would have little chance of succeeding if the UN sanctions are not lifted within weeks. It predicts that a sustained trade blockade will trigger mass unemployment, with nearly one million people likely to lose their jobs, and warns that &quot;the social collapse will then be total&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbia's opposition parties have used the deteriorating economy as a main theme in their campaign to force the resignation of the republic's president, Slobodan Milosevic. But their tactic has so far had minimal impact since the majority of the population perceives UN sanctions as directed at them rather than their leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State-controlled television has reinforced this impression, highlighting the security council's vacillation about approving airlifts of humanitarian aid to Serbian parts of Bosnia as evidence of alleged UN hostility towards the Serb nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By shifting attention to what they call the &quot;inhumanity&quot; of sanctions, the Belgrade authorities have been able to take the sting out of an anti-government demonstration in the Serbian capital, now into its fourth day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 100,000 people turned out on the opening day of the rally, but the crowds have now dwindled to no more than 3,000 diehards. The poor attendances have bitterly disappointed the protest organisers, the Serbian Democratic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Depos) - an alliance of opposition parties spearheading calls for the resignation of Mr Milosevic and the formation of a government of &quot;national salvation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the apparent failure of the demonstration, it is unlikely that the president regards Depos as a serious threat to his leadership. He has even been emboldened to offer to hold presidential elections, knowing his success would be virtually secured by his monopoly of the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Depos is unimpressed by the gesture. But while its campaign has suffered an early blow, it is determined to continue calling for Mr Milosevic to stand down. &quot;Our expectations have not been met, but the door has nevertheless been opened a crack,&quot; the alliance's spokesman, Vladeta Jankovic, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political analysts in Belgrade believe the odds are heavily stacked against Depos achieving its aims peacefully. They warn that radical members may lose patience with the &quot;softly softly&quot; approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presence of militant ultra-nationalists and monarchists at the Belgrade rally suggests there is no shortage of people within Depos who are prepared to resort to violence. Depos leaders are aware of the militant factions within their ranks and take care to avoid inciting the hotheads. But the organisation may be tempted to become more aggressive if it fails to muster more support - a move which many believe would increase the prospect of civil war in Serbia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Steele One year on and Kosovo still suffers from the tragic consequences of unresolved conflict</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Sava Janjic is one of the bravest Serbs left in Kosovo.  A soft-spoken figure whose scholarly appearance masks passionately held views, his rare quality is his willingness to acknowledge the crimes done to Albanians by the Milosevic regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet as he sits in the refectory of the monastery of Gracanica, he has little to feel cheerful about.  A leader of the Serbian National Council in Kosovo, he became the voice of Serbs who felt they should cooperate with the United Nations administration when it arrived in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he feels let down and under pressure.  K-For, the international peace-keeping force, is failing to protect Serbs enough to give them freedom of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> beyond their prison enclaves, let alone create conditions for those who left Kosovo to want to come home.  In the northern city of Mitrovice pro-Milosevic Serbs boast that their success in keeping Albanians out shows that a tough line is the only solution.  Father Sava senses Slobodan Milosevic's support in Kosovo is growing and that the hardliners who denounce K-For as nothing more than an occupation force are gaining strength.  The trouble in Mitrovice is not just a battle between Serbs and Albanians but a struggle for the allegiance of Kosovo's Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Sava regrets the lack of support that he and his boss, Bishop Artemije, Kosovo's senior Orthodox clergyman, have had from opposition politicians in Belgrade.  At a recent meeting the two men asked the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> politicians to sign a joint declaration that would stress two points: that it was not an act of treason for Kosovo's Serbs to work with the UN, and that &quot;injustices&quot; had been inflicted on Albanians.  This was too much for Belgrade's opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had it been signed, the statement would have had far-ranging benefits.  The clerics are convinced that unless more Serbs acknowledge that the atrocities done in their name are the prime cause of the hatred that bedevils Kosovo today, tolerance will take a long time to grow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is easy to see that Serbs cannot readily accept that their side bears the greater guilt.  What is more depressing is the way this escape from the facts is beginning to creep into Western discourse on Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allan Little's recent BBC2 programme, Moral Combat, was only the latest example of the tendency to say a plague on both houses.  The notion of &quot;balance&quot; made little distinction between a state-machine whose security forces use arson, artillery, and cold-blooded murder on a mass scale against people still in their homes, and the revenge-seeking of bereaved people returning to destroyed villages and burning the houses of their Serbian neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now we have moved to a second post-war stage, where crime in Kosovo is random, opportunistic, urban and largely carried out by professional criminals who want to make money.  It is the inevitable consequence of a law and order vacuum, for which the international community is mainly to blame for failing to provide the police it promised.  Take away the police from London or Berlin, and see how quickly the crime rate would soar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to deny that the current violence against Serbs in Kosovo takes place in a vindictive atmosphere where most Albanians think ethnically.  Far from restraining them, parents encourage their children to stone Serbian buses when they pass through Albanian areas under K-For escort.  The Albanian press does not report fairly on what is being done to Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is where Father Sava comes back in.  Albanians would start to differentiate and not lump all Serbs together as evil-doers if they felt more Serbs were able to accept the truth about what happened in 1998 and 1999.  Albanians would also relax if more Serbs did not go on behaving as though the Serbs can still win the war and get K-For to withdraw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ambiguity of UN resolution 1244, which left Kosovo's final status obscure, has become a liability.  It gives false encouragement to Serbs and real anxiety to Albanians.  What is needed is a forthright statement by the Western powers that Kosovo will never return to Serbian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Albanians such a declaration would provide a reason to stop seeing every Serb in Kosovo as a potential fifth columnist.  In exchange for such an international commitment, the leaders of the various Kosovo Albanian parties should be urged to agree to a formal statement that the territory will remain legally part of Yugoslavia, though under international protection, for three or five more years.  In that period Milosevic might finally leave power or Yugoslavia might dissolve -- leaving Kosovo independent by default.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials are putting strong pressure on the president of Montenegro and the leader of Serbia's largest opposition party to take part in Yugoslav elections called in September, according to Yugoslav politicians and Western officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American officials argue that a united opposition in Serbia, together with voters in Montenegro, Serbia's increasingly independent partner in the Yugoslav federation, would have a good chance of defeating President Slobodan Milosevic in the presidential and parliamentary elections he has called for Sept. 24.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Milosevic and his allies have begun a new wave of repression and altered the Constitution to create direct elections for his position -- which he otherwise would have to relinquish next July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only time the opposition triumphed in past elections was when it united for municipal elections in 1996, winning in Belgrade and dozens of other cities. Mr. Milosevic initially refused to recognize the victories, setting off three months of protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the coming elections are manipulated or stolen, as expected, the Americans argue, the opposition will have another rallying cry for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations. But a boycott provides no chance to beat Mr. Milosevic, they say, and a divided opposition has almost no chance to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late 1997, Milo Djukanovic broke with Mr. Milosevic and won the presidency in Montenegro. He has allied himself with the West, but is refusing to take part in the September elections, arguing that the constitutional changes were made without consultation with Montenegro and aim to reduce its influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djukanovic's officials say that to take part in the elections would only ratify Mr. Milosevic's constitutional coup and legitimize the likely outcome -- a Milosevic victory, fair or otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes to the Constitution have also removed previous requirements for a minimum turnout of half the eligible voters -- apparently to blunt any opposition boycott or the effect of widespread apathy among a generally depressed electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the largest single opposition party in Serbia, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says he will not take part in federal elections if Mr. Djukanovic will not. Mr. Draskovic also argues that the elections cannot be free and fair -- with attacks on opposition politicians, the judiciary, student protesters and government pressure on independent news media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest of Serbia's political opposition, largely grouped into the Alliance for Change, says it will take part, and is urging Mr. Draskovic to follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic is almost sure to take part in the local elections, where his party has many seats and privileges to defend. A boycott of the elections would cause a revolt in his own party, Draskovic aides admit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A likely opposition presidential candidate is Vojislav Kostunica, a moderate nationalist who is considered free of corruption or of cooptation by the West -- distinguishing him from Mr. Draskovic or his great rival, Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, the government took over the Belgrade television station Mr. Draskovic controlled, Studio B, and prevented the independent radio station, B2-92, and two others from broadcasting in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has been regularly suing the independent news media under a tough information law passed in October 1998 and has also restricted newsprint to major independent publications, particularly Blic, a popular tabloid whose circulation has been reduced by nearly half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And last week, in a trial that produced outrage domestically and internationally, a Serbian journalist, Miroslav Filipovic, was convicted by a military court in Nis on charges of espionage and sentenced to seven years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Filipovic, who works for the independent Belgrade publication Danas, Agence France-Presse and a London-based Internet site called the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, wrote a number of articles that annoyed the government, including one that cited an internal Yugoslav Army report on unhappiness and remorse over the brutal tactics used against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo -- tactics that caused Mr. Milosevic and four top aides to be indicted by an international tribunal on charges of war crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unusually for a suspected spy, Mr. Filipovic signed his name to his articles, and no evidence was presented to indicate that he had secret contacts with any foreigner or intelligence agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has also accused other independent journalists in Serbia of being spies and working on the orders of the Central Intelligence Agency or the same NATO countries that bombed Serbia last year, but in no case has provided evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While those forms of pressure are hardly new in Serbia, they are increasing and indicate pre-election nervousness in the Milosevic camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Milosevic is very shaky and obviously very concerned about these elections,&quot; said Ognjen Pribicevic, a Draskovic aide. &quot;His worry is not just because of the opposition, but because the situation in Serbia is disintegrating in every sense, economically and politically.&quot;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PRESIDENT Slobodan Milosevic is fighting for his political survival as he enters the last week of a vicious presidential campaign tainted by intimidation and haunted by fears of electoral fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Faced for the first time in a decade by an opposition united behind a single candidate, Milosevic is trailing in every opinion poll. But observers fear his defeat, which would bring a political sea change in Yugoslavia, would be followed by repression and bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tensions rose on Friday, when a gang of men in civilian clothes stormed the Belgrade offices of the get-out-and-vote campaign.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They entered the office of the group, known as Vreme Je (It Is Time), locking the youngsters working there in a room and taking computers, documents and other equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Vreme Je workers were offloaded from a van at Belgrade police station, said opposition politician Gaso Knezavic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last weekend police moved on the headquarters of the student-based resistance group Otpor, roughing-up a small group of youngsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime refuses to allow observers from allegedly hostile countries and organisations to monitor the elections. Opposition activists in Serbia have been taken to police stations for 'informative talks'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week the regime campaign switched into high gear. Milosevic made two rare personal appearances. Last Tuesday he opened a new hydro-electric dam and on Friday the Zastava car plant in Kragujevac. His speech was plastered across the front of the state newspaper, Politika, and dominated state television news, which played on the regime's campaign theme: reconstruction. 'This generation really has something to leave to the generation to come - a 10-year-old resistance to violence, strongly expressed national solidarity and courageous ability to cope in difficult times,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Veselin Simonevic, editor of the popular non-government newspaper Blic , says this time it won't wash. 'In the short and long term, Milosevic is a loser. He is finished.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last summer, when Milosevic changed the constitution and made the position of president directly electable, it seemed a brilliant ruse, enabling him to hold power for a further two terms. He believed egocentric opposition leaders would continue wars of vanity 'in this he miscalculated', says Simonevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to opinion polls, the politician most people would vote for as a presidential candidate was the leader of one of the smaller parties, Dr Vojislav Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His candidacy has turned the presidential poll into a serious race for high stakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In two weeks Kostunica has criss-crossed the country, drumming up support from eastern border towns to the west, and even made a dangerous trip to Kosovo, when the Nato-led protection force had to intervene with riot squads to separate warring pro and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kostunica aims to mobilise disillusioned voters. He offers what many say they seek: 'changes' and 'a normal life'. Analysts say if Milosevic were defeated 'it would destroy the decade-long myth of invincibility'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Milosevic did not count on Kostunica,' says Simonevic. 'He counted that the leaders of the opposition parties, who always struggle between themselves, will do so again and that he would win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Many citizens are not for Milosevic and have not been for a long time,' he says, but explains that the opposition split the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vote. This time this is not happening. 'This is why Kostunica has a real chance.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every opinion poll published shows Kostunica ahead of Milosevic. The least optimistic showed Milosevic with 26 per cent and Kostunica with 29 per cent. But other polls have shown the opposition contender steaming ahead. This would force a second round of voting - between Milosevic and Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Socialist Party member Milovan Drecun, who recently formed his own opposition party, asserts there will be voting fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Milosevic wants to win the poll with 2.5 million votes in the first round,' says Drecun. No second round is planned.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite his most disastrous two months in a decade-long reign, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic still casts such a long shadow that his political opponents cannot quite believe they are on the verge of their first big success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight weeks after Milosevic's courts overturned opposition electoral victories in 14 Serbian cities and towns -- and one day after government electoral commissions restored those victories in Belgrade and another key city -- Serbs are still trying to sort out perceived skulduggery by Milosevic, his Socialist Party and its partners in Serbia's ruling coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conspiracy is so ingrained in Serbia's political heritage that the leaders of the opposition coalition known as Together have voiced suspicions that Milosevic, long the master manipulator, may yet deprive them of their victories despite serious, if ambiguous, signs that he is giving in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as they call for Milosevic's resignation at daily demonstrations, opposition leaders say they do not really believe that gaining power in all the disputed cities and towns would force him from office. And many Serbs refuse to count Milosevic out in future elections despite the creaking and groaning of what long appeared to be a perfectly oiled political machine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's still a stemwinding orator, a clever demagogue,&quot; a foreign observer said, &quot;even if right now his reputation as the great communicator has suffered for having failed to communicate in the past two months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remarked a longtime Milosevic associate: &quot;Back in 1990, Milosevic was God in the eyes of the Serbian Academy of Sciences, the Orthodox Church, the army, the police, indeed 90 percent of Serbia's population. Now he's just president of Serbia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the impenetrably confusing developments of the past 24 hours, it is easy to understand why both sides in the crisis are casting about for signs of what is to come. For example:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alarm bells began ringing soon after the electoral reversal in Belgrade, with a reported threat by Branislav Ivkovic, the city's sacked Socialist Party boss, to challenge the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, no official complaint questioning that decision was filed today, and the deadline for appeals was to have expired at noon Thursday. Or so it was initially thought -- until the electoral commission announced late today that its official letters of notification to politicians affected by Tuesday's ruling would not be delivered until Thursday morning, thus delaying the 48-hour challenge period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informed sources said the delay was caused by a frantic, time-consuming but eventually successful search for an ironclad judicial precedent allowing an administrative body such as the electoral commission to overrule a court decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before this latest twist, leery Serbs seized on the Belgrade electoral commission's ruling that 10 of the city's 110 council seats remained in doubt as proof that even if Milosevic could not deny Together its 60-seat council majority, he was determined to delay the winners from taking up their duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further anxiety was caused when Belgrade University's governing council -- made up of faculty, university officials and government-appointed representatives -- voted in a secret ballot to reject student demands that the university's rector be replaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early in the seven-hour council session, a majority of its members had voted to accept a catalogue of demands from the university's students, who have formed the backbone of the daily </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations. Among the demands, which two government deputy prime ministers had promised would be honored, was the removal of the rector, Dragutin Veliskovic. But another vote was held, and the students' friends on the council persuaded only 25 of its 76 members to vote for Veliskovic's ouster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rector asserted that the first vote was on whether to consider his case, not to approve his dismissal. Student leader Cedomir Andic remarked, &quot;We are confused, and they [the council] are hypocritical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Novi Belgrade, across the Danube River from the old city, council seats in eight boroughs were awarded to outgoing Socialists despite a finding by observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that the opposition had won them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition representatives were reduced to protesting outside the premises where the Socialists assumed office. Nonetheless, Vuk Draskovic, one of Together's three co-leaders, told followers at a downtown demonstration that they were &quot;closer than ever to having our victory recognized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A court deciding who should govern the central town of Smederevska Palanka ruled in favor of the Socialists, the Associated Press reported. The court recognized the Socialists' victory in a runoff election that the opposition had boycotted after insisting that the original results that gave control of the town be respected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All but overlooked in the recent turmoil were purges underway in Socialist Party ranks as Milosevic seeks to dilute responsibility for mishandling the crisis. But no matter how many party stalwarts are sacrificed, diplomats and analysts insist, Milosevic stands to lose face in Serbia's macho politics if Together assumes power in Belgrade and wins back the other disputed municipalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dismayed Milosevic supporters are worried enough to talk openly of what one termed &quot;saving Milosevic from himself,&quot; and friend and foe alike have expressed amazement at his vacillation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after the disputed elections, which were held Nov. 17, Milosevic initially signaled his willingness to accept Together's victories. He said at the time that multi-party politics involves the risk of losing elections and wrote the lost municipalities off as headaches for an opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that he likened to a &quot;jumbo jet without a pilot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within days, however, Serbian courts annulled voting results in the 14 localities the opposition had won, citing irregularities. The daily </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations ensued, and the president has been virtually silent ever since, making just a handful of public appearances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic is an erratic political animal. His challenge to Slobodan Milosevic was the latest episode in a strange career, writes Geoff Kitney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IF his face gives the appearance of having been smashed repeatedly into a brick wall this is because it once was, on the orders of the man against whom he has just seriously reoffended. Having in the past been savagely tortured by Slobodan Milosevic's special police, Vuk Draskovic will be understandably nervous about what he faces this time for his rebelliousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So is the man who has just been sacked by Europe's most feared political tyrant for what were described by one hard-line member of the government as &quot;treasonable&quot; offences brave or crazy? A bit of both, say those who know him and have watched his erratic and self-destructive course through the minefield of Belgrade politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what does his latest, reckless political adventure say about what is happening at the top of Serbian politics as Milosevic leads his nation towards a sixth week of war and ever deepening misery.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO leaders, desperate to find a way of forcing Milosevic's capitulation and an end to the humanitarian disaster that has followed their attempt to bomb him into submission, saw hope in Draskovic's conciliatory public statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until he was sacked, they had thought he might be acting as a message carrier from Milosevic, putting out feelers for dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Milosevic killed this hope by dumping Draskovic from his Cabinet they said it showed cracks were showing in the Serb leadership, and that Draskovic's dissent was the beginning of a challenge to Milosevic's iron grip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if NATO is waiting to see a dissent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> form around Draskovic and for this to speed the end of the war, it is making yet another misjudgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without internal pressure there is no reason for Milosevic to negotiate. The ball is in NATO's court and if it, too, is not prepared to compromise, its only option is the military one. And unless it is prepared to mount a ground-force invasion, it has no alternative but to continue the bombing. That means a long, slow, grinding military campaign that can do little to stop the persecution, execution and expulsion of the ethnic Albanians the NATO military action was intended to protect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spotlight that fell this week on Draskovic exposed the opposite of what NATO thought it saw: it revealed just how tragically threadbare are the opposition forces to Milosevic in Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The disastrous thing . . . is that Vuk Draskovic is probably the best alternative leader available. He is half-mad, untrustworthy, has no consistent set of beliefs or objectives and is probably corrupt,&quot; said someone who once worked with him. &quot;I don't believe there is any prospect of Vuk being able to rally the people to challenge Milosevic. He might have been able to do that a few years ago but he betrayed us and our hopes for democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, as leader of the largest opposition party - the Serbian Renewal Party - Draskovic and other opposition figures formed the Zajedno (Together) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coalition, which won sweeping victories in local government elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic tried to annul the results, claiming they had been rigged. For more than 80 days Belgraders staged protest marches and rallies in the city centre. Crowds of 100,000 and more turned out, with Draskovic in the lead and his followers chanting &quot;Vuk, Vuk, Vuk&quot;. It was a heady chant - Vuk means wolf in Serbo-Croatian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at one of these rallies, one of Draskovic's supporters saw something that dismayed her and convinced her that he was a Vuk in someone else's clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students had organised a rally at which they did not want to have any politicians speak. When Draskovic and his wife, Danicsa, were told this Danicsa shouted abuse, and their bodyguards roughly shoved students aside so that Draskovic could speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic's Serbian Renewal Party had a platform committed to free enterprise, Westminster-style democracy, restoration of community values and to taking Yugoslavia into the European mainstream, including aiming for membership of the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic strongly opposed the militaristic nationalism of Milosevic, which landed him and Danicsa in jail in 1993 at the height of the war in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both were tortured, and Danicsa was forced to watch as Vuk had his face repeatedly smashed into the stone wall of his cell. They were freed after they went on a hunger strike and Milosevic feared they might become opposition martyrs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commitment of the Serbian Renewal Party to its democratic platform had its limitations. When the party took control of the Studio B television station in Belgrade, Draskovic fired all staff who were not party supporters. Nevertheless, Studio B did support the democracy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and became an alternative to the propaganda-filled Serbian state media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic fell out with Zoran Djindjic and Vesna Pesic, the two other most influential pro-demo- cracy politicians, and the coalition fell apart. This let Milosevic play his opponents off against each other and left pro-democracy supporters increasingly disillusioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In presidential elections in 1997, the opposition squabbled over who should oppose Milosevic. Draskovic insisted on running, splitting the opposition vote and allowing Milosevic to win comfortably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Milosevic reasserted his political dominance, the chain-smoking, big-drinking Draskovic faded from prominence for a while, pursuing his other career as a writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic publicly backed Milosevic's hard line against the ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, further disillusioning his former supporters. Then this January, as NATO intensified its threats to bomb Serbia if Milosevic did not withdraw his forces from Kosovo and allow it autonomy, Draskovic accepted an offer to join the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister, allowing Milosevic to tell the world that all Serbs were united behind him on Kosovo and to use Draskovic's links with the West to give the impression of being willing to maintain a dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The politician who had been the great hope of Yugoslav democrats did not seem to find it too uncomfortable sitting at the same Cabinet table as the brutal dictator who had ordered his torture six years earlier, and his former mortal political enemy, the ultra-nationalist Vojislav Seselj.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Draskovic's decision this week to warn that Serbia could not win the war with NATO, to accuse the state media of lying and to suggest that the leadership would have to accept an armed international peacekeeping force in Kosovo was an attempt to rescue some credibility. Perhaps he was trying to position himself for possible opportunities should Milosevic lead his country to complete collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that it is now clear he was speaking without Milosevic's authority and that there is no evidence of any significant internal dissent, there seems no other logical explanation for saying things that virtually guaranteed he would be dismissed and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">placed at real physical risk.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am afraid that the tension between the two ethnic groups will increase. Every time one side acts, the other reacts&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This observation by the mayor of Tetovo yesterday captures exactly why the escalation of violence this week in that region of Macedonia is so worrying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its use by the National Liberation Army (a branch of the Kosovo Liberation Army) was designed to provoke such a reaction. Such a polarisation could destroy Macedonia's sensitive balance between Albanians - about one-third of the two million population - and the majority Slavs. Since gaining independence from Yugoslavia a coalition of parties representing both groups has made substantial progress in developing the country and reversing discrimination against the Albanian minority.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence tests the integrity of that fragile relationship by exposing partisan actions and reactions. Thus the moderate Albanian parties have been complaining they have not been consulted about the government's military response. Every casualty provokes a debate. It is precisely this polarisation that turns to the advantage of the N/KLA, which up to now has been rebuffed by most Albanian parties and voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its support of a greater Albania is regarded by informed observers as quite unrealistic, not least because few Kosovan or Macedonian Albanians want to unite with Albania proper, a much less developed country. But its plan for an independent Kosovo, to include Macedonian Albanians, remains much more active, despite its isolation politically in Kosovo and the greater difficulty in putting the plan forward following the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> revolution in Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That has led European governments to re-emphasise support for the principle of territorial integrity for Yugoslavia/Kosovo and for Macedonia. But the legacy of the Kosovo war hangs over this latest Balkan crisis in Macedonia. The KLA was created, after all, by the NATO coalition that ran the war. There remain disagreements between the US government - more tolerant of independence for Kosovo - and the Europeans, who reject it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush administration has not clarified its policy on the matter; it is unwilling to commit extra troops - and probably wants to reduce it - or to endanger the existing US complement in Kfor by policing the boundary zone between Kosovo and Macedonia more robustly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of fighters has been made easier. So has the drug smuggling and human trafficking for which the area has become notorious. Such interests have more to gain from conflict than relative peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way or another it falls to the European Union to manage this crisis politically. Its message to the Macedonian government and Kosovan leaders in recent days has been that politics must accompany military responses to the KLA provocations. Hence the initiatives to include the moderate Albanian parties in Macedonia's national security committee and EU pressure to open a political dialogue capable of delivering reforms for the Albanian minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kosovo this week an EU delegation made it clear to political leaders that continued development aid depends on renouncing violence and deepening political dialogue. As the Commissioner for External Relations, Chris Patten, put it: &quot;Violence in Macedonia will wreck any effort to rebuild the economy in Kosovo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same message came from the EU summit it Stockholm yesterday, where the Macedonian President, Mr Boris Trajkowski, met its leaders. The tone was set earlier in the week by the German Chancellor, Mr Gerhard Shroder, who said the Macedonian government would have to be more careful with Albanian rights. The German weekly, Die Zeit, went further, calling for the south Balkans to be declared an EU protectorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German experts are pessimistic that the EU's long-term development strategy is capable of withstanding the strain of these events. Such comment is eerily reminiscent of warnings over the last decade about the importance of avoiding conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and then Kosovo, because of the complexity of their histories, politics and multicultural societies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On that benchmark Macedonia is the real cauldron of the south Balkans. In his fine history of the region Misha Glenny points out that it &quot;was and is the crossroads of the Balkan peninsula&quot;. It &quot;was Europe's most enduring and complex multi cultural region&quot;. When the process of fragmentation in the Balkans began, &quot;the potential for violence in this region was greater than anywhere else&quot;.*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was writing about the 1880s-1900s, which culminated in the two Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913 involving Greek, Serb, Bulgarians and Montenegrins against the retreating Ottoman empire. Some 200,000 combatants (excluding civilians) were killed in a ghastly prefiguration of the first World War, egged on by the imperial powers which funded and armed those involved, with the greatest devastation inflicted on Macedonia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 20th century's successive waves of violence to some extent simplified Macedonia's complex multiculturalism; but the grave destabilising potential for its neighbours, were it to unravel, is so historically determined that it would be very difficult to contain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Dublin earlier this month Mr Patten said the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy &quot;is about projecting stability&quot; and that &quot;a key test is its ability to prevent conflict&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That makes this crisis its first real challenge, since it was supplemented last with a more elaborate political-military apparatus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A common, rather than a single foreign policy, he said, is well-fitted for the post-imperial task of incorporating the Balkan region into Europe through stabilisation and accession agreements, with the long-term perspective of joining the EU. Those carrots and sticks are put powerfully to the test in Macedonia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VLAJKO STOJILJKOVIC, Interior Minister of Serbia until 2000, belonged to the closest circle of the former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. He was known for his endless loyalty to Milosevic and his cruelty towards all who opposed him. Yet, faced with possible extradition to the international tribunal in The Hague, to be charged with war crimes in Kosovo in 1999, he chose to kill himself instead of joining his friend on trial. It remains unclear whether Milosevic will view this as an act of bravery or betrayal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Born in 1937, Stojiljkovic graduated from Belgrade Law School and more or less made his career in Pozarevac, Milosevic's hometown, some 100km east of Belgrade. He was not a popular figure, and even his comrades in Milosevic's Socialist Party viewed Stojiljkovic as rigid, and not too bright.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For many years, he was the head of the Pozarevac police, chief of police of the eastern Serbian region and ran one of the biggest prisons in Serbia, Zabela, situated on the outskirts of Pozarevac. There were a few short intervals in his police career when he headed Serbian or Yugoslav chambers of commerce in the early 1990s. As Milosevic's trusted friend, Stojiljkovic was appointed Interior Minister in 1997. He resigned from the post after Milosevic fell from power in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two spent a lot of time together in Pozarevac, where the Milosevic family resided at weekends and holidays. Vlajko and &quot;Sloba&quot; would play chess together, or go fishing on the banks of the Danube. It was under Stojiljkovic's scrutiny that Milosevic's son Marko developed a business empire in Pozarevac and became the notorious lord of the town. Milosevic junior fled the country after his father's fall from power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was also under Stojiljkovic's lead that the Serbian police turned into a brutal force, with the special aim of fighting rebellious ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province. The police became an efficient tool against the opponents of Milosevic's regime in the period that preceded his fall from power. Both were viewed by Stojiljkovic with hatred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Excessive force was the trademark of his career as minister in charge of police. He demanded total obedience and was rigid in planning and executing actions. The Serbian police force did whatever it wanted in the southern province of Kosovo from 1998 onwards, when the armed rebellion of ethnic Albanians and their Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) started. Any resistance was branded &quot;terrorism&quot; by Milosevic's regime. In the 11 weeks of Nato air raids against Serbia in 1999, the actions of the Serbian police against ethnic Albanians looked like an open manhunt. Some former top officials say today that it was Stojiljkovic who insisted on harsh measures against &quot;terrorists&quot; in Kosovo, &quot;to teach them a lesson for good&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The actions of the Serbian security forces in the province left at least 10,000 ethnic Albanians dead. The bodies of victims of mass executions were transferred to Serbia proper at the time of Nato air raids, in refrigerator trucks that were later dumped into rivers. Further, 800,000 ethnic Albanians were forced to leave their homes and seek shelter in neighbouring Albania and Macedonia. Stojiljkovic always described these reports as &quot;fabrications&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two years ago, when the Serbian opposition joined ranks to topple Milosevic in the elections, Stojiljkovic used the forces at his disposal to quell rebellion at home. Activists in the student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor (Resistance) were arrested and severely beaten by the police, street protests were met with disproportionate and unnecessary force. Cordons of anti-riot police in places around Serbia where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests were being held became a commonplace. As did being beaten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stojiljkovic allowed the Serbian mafia to flourish and several assassinations or assassination attempts against Milosevic's opponents took place. Vaults that were at the disposal of the notorious security service held more than 500kg of cocaine, ready to be sold in the streets of Serbia. As police minister, Stojiljkovic must have known about all these things. He was in charge of both branches of the ministry - dealing with public security and the secret service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But all this became history on 5 October 2000, when a popular uprising swept Milosevic from power. Seeing that several hundred thousand people, from all over Serbia, had taken to the streets of Belgrade in the biggest ever </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti- Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protest, the Serbian police became practical; they decided to disobey orders and not to shoot at the protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Stojiljkovic had other ideas. Witnesses say he was unaware that the protests were on such a large scale. He gave orders from his cabinet, over the phone, contacting the most important police generals. One of his ideas was that police helicopters should be used to drop toxic chemicals to disperse protesters in front of the federal parliament building. The chopper crews decided not carry out the order. By the end of the dramatic day, Milosevic was ousted. People who know Stojiljkovic say that he could not believe it, on that day, or for months afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stojiljkovic chose the entrance of the federal parliament building in which to shoot himself last Thursday. As an MP of Milosevic's party, he was leaving parliament after a new law allowing further extraditions to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague had just been passed. In his suicide note, he said that the Serbian police were honourable men and that &quot;the defenders of the country&quot; who fought against &quot;terrorism and Nato&quot; should not be extradited to the tribunal, as they were heroes. He believed himself to be one of them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Sept. 20</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition infighting and confusion over competing strategies have markedly slowed the drive to topple Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic since a series of mass rallies spawned by the Kosovo war put his government on the defensive over the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One sign of Milosevic's belief in his survival emerged last week, when his spokesman withdrew an offer of early elections that had been extended as a way to defuse what appeared to be a swelling wave of criticism. The shift was seen as a sign that Milosevic believes he can ride out the postwar discontent without concessions to the political opposition, which is demanding a change in leadership for Yugoslavia and its dominant republic, Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A portion of the opposition will try to regain momentum with rallies on Tuesday in 20 cities, including Belgrade, the Yugoslav and Serbian capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The turnout and fervor exhibited will be seen as a gauge of public stamina, which many observers think has been sapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war-weary country, with Kosovo effectively cut off, seems ripe for rebellion. Displaced people crowd shelters and complain of government indifference. International trade sanctions have exacerbated deep economic problems. Prices are rising, fuel is in short supply, and jobs are scarce. Reconstruction after the war has been limited to patchwork repair of roads, bridges and housing. Without foreign help and a reopening to world trade, recovery is impossible, economists say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for people hoping for quick change, opposition wrangling is an unwelcome diversion. Polls show that few expect Milosevic's exit soon, and some fear violence. Washington, eager for Milosevic's ouster, is quietly lobbying for opposition unity but has gotten nowhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our opposition is awful,&quot; said Aleksa Djilas, an independent political observer. &quot;It's the main reason Milosevic is still in power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They want us to go out into the streets, but I don't feel like putting my head out to be hit to benefit politicians who just stand for themselves,&quot; said Dragan Savic, an auto repairman who took part in early demonstrations but plans to stay home from now on. &quot;I have enough problems just to survive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many analysts agree that before a credible challenge to Milosevic can be mounted, one key opposition rivalry must be resolved--that between Zoran Djindjic and Vuk Draskovic. Djindjic heads the Alliance for Change, a coalition of opposition parties that wants Milosevic to resign in favor of a government of economic experts that would form an interim administration pending new elections. The alliance is spearheading Tuesday's rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic leads the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which alternately has opposed Milosevic and formed part of his ruling coalition. Draskovic wants immediate elections without the government of experts as an interim step and is staying away from Tuesday's demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic, a butch-cut philosopher and former student activist, and Draskovic, a bearded novelist, despise each other. The pair appeared on the same platform in August, during the last big </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally in Belgrade. Since then, they have been at each other's throats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Djindjic criticize Draskovic for alleged corruption in the Belgrade city government he controls and for cozying up to Milosevic. Draskovic's associates fault Djindjic for everything from speaking broken English to a lack of patriotism for fleeing Serbia during the Kosovo war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic says the demonstrations are the first in a series of protests, sit-ins and road blockades meant to undermine Milosevic. &quot;The goal is to show that he cannot govern,&quot; Djindjic said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic and his alliance back Dragoslav Avramovic, a former head of the Central Bank, as their candidate to head a post-Milosevic government. Avramovic worked wonders in pulling Yugoslavia out of hyperinflation in the early 1990s and is widely regarded as the country's most popular politician. But even Avramovic, 77, has doubts about his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every morning I wake up and wonder, do I need this?&quot; he said the other day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's turnout will be scrutinized as a measure of Djindjic's ability to draw a crowd. A light turnout will inevitably bring calls for Djindjic to bow to Draskovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic's followers insist that Djindjic is unelectable and that only the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is capable of taking on Milosevic. Last week, a delegation of Draskovic's aides traveled to Montenegro--Serbia's disaffected partner in the Yugoslav federation--to try to persuade U.S. State Department officials to support his early election plan. According to American officials, Washington was noncommittal and stressed the importance of opposition unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only Draskovic can win; he's got the charisma and the party,&quot; said an aide in a typical partisan evaluation. If Djindjic falters, Draskovic will call his followers into the streets with the aim of forcing elections, to be conducted under strict rules, including international supervision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The divisions and stumbling do not mean Milosevic has let down his guard. On the contrary, he spares little effort to undermine the opposition. Last Friday, the Yugoslav government opened a new barge-supported bridge across the Danube River in Novi Sad at the same time that Alliance for Change had scheduled a convention in the city. Novi Sad's bridges were destroyed by NATO aircraft during the war, and residents have had to use ferries to cross the river.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workers at the site said they were ordered to open the span to pedestrian traffic early, even though railings were not yet in place and seams in the concrete roadbed were still being filled with tar. &quot;They wanted to attract the public away from alliance's rally,&quot; said one worker.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SLOBODAN Milosevic was warned to step down or risk a bloody civil war last night as protests escalated across Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In areas once considered the heartland of support for the Yugoslav president, tens of thousands took to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A petition calling for his removal has now collected more than 100,000 signatures, opposition leaders said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was signed by 3,000 on its first day in Serbia's largest southern city, Nis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the bitter aftermath of the ill-fated campaign of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, an 11-week war against Nato and Milosevic's ludicrous claims of victory, anger against the dictator had simmered rather than boiled over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But growing demonstrations banned by the government have shown the public mood changing to frustration and mounting anger through the past week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Leskovac, 180 miles south of the capital Belgrade, more than 10,000 people took to the streets over the past three days to chant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> slogans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several people were injured as protesters demanding the release of a local television engineer clashed with baton-wielding police.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For his troubles he was jailed for 30 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By mid-afternoon yesterday there were reports that sections of the crowd many of them bitter former Army reservists who had served in Kosovo were armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a separate protest organised by the Alliance for Change an umbrella group of opposition parties 6,000 people in the central industrial city of Uzice heard Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic declare: 'The time is now right for Serbia to rid itself of Milosevic and his party.' The rising star of the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> later warned that the growing tide of 'people power is unstoppable'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He feared the government might resort to violence, saying: 'There is a danger of civil war here and now.' His planned visit to Kosovo today is only likely to heighten tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The potential for violence escalated yesterday when police said they would halt an antigovernment demonstration in Prokuplje, 20 miles from Nis, while allowing a pro-Milosevic rally to go ahead.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riot police loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic attacked thousands of anti-government street protesters in separate demonstrations today, signaling that the Balkan strongman remains firmly in control despite recent electoral setbacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one incident, hundreds of police fired tear gas and swung clubs to break up a protest by several thousand ethnic Albanian students in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo. The Albanians, who represent about 90 percent of the population in Kosovo but only a minority overall in Yugoslavia, were demanding the right to an Albanian-language education.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the other incident, several hundred riot police attacked thousands of marchers in Belgrade who were protesting the firing of Mayor Zoran Djindjic and the removal of editors of the capital's only independent television station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and its European allies protested the use of excessive force in both incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In elections last month in Serbia, which makes up most of what is left of the former Yugoslavia, candidates loyal to Milosevic lost ground to radical nationalist opponents running for the republic's parliament and presidency. But the authoritarian Milosevic, who only last winter was reeling from weeks of street protests, remains firmly in control of the police, as he demonstrated today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the police attack in the Kosovo capital, Pristina, leaders of the Albanian students called off planned daily demonstrations late today. They said they will pursue their campaign for Albanian-language instruction at Pristina University by less confrontational means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Reuter news agency, reporting from Pristina, said the students appeared surprised by the firmness of the police crackdown after the government promised Western diplomats it would not use force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Belgrade, the protests were triggered by Tuesday's vote by the city assembly to fire Djindjic and replace the management board of the independent Studio B television station, which backed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic called today for fresh demonstrations against Milosevic. But the vote to oust the mayor was inspired equally by his former ally in an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coalition, Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Draskovic is angry with Djindjic for leading a drive to boycott last month's Serbian elections, in which Draskovic ran for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear whether, after the tough police response today, Djindjic's supporters again would take to the streets to back him in what has become an internecine struggle between Milosevic's foes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP-Reuters) - Darkening movie houses,<BR> blocking roads and shutting shops, tens of thousands of Yugoslavs<BR> heeded opposition calls yesterday for countrywide strikes aimed<BR> at forcing President Slobodan Milosevic to accept election defeat<BR> and step down.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even as opposition leaders explained the campaign to about 25,000 supporters in Belgrade's main square, students rallied in the country's south, shopkeepers shuttered their doors in the east and television workers cut off transmissions in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Cease your work, come out and stay on the streets, so that this country will find its path to future,&quot; opposition leader Zoran Djindjic told the Belgrade crowd. &quot;Serbia must stop for us to unload Milosevic out of a seat he no longer has a right to.&quot; Serbia and the smaller Montenegro make up Yugoslavia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition called the protests to pressure Milosevic to admit that challenger Vojislav Kostunica won last Sunday's election. Milosevic admits he finished second, but his government says no candidate won a majority so an Oct. 8 run-off is necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The actors' guild declared a strike, and most theatre and cinema owners said they would shut down. Several roads were blocked in northern and southern parts of Serbia and over 7,000 coal miners stopped work in Kolubara, 40 kilometres south of Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two protests, one in the afternoon and the other in the evening, attracted a total of 50,000 people to Belgrade's main Republic Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police briefly blocked one of three main bridges over the Sava River, trying to prevent people and a column of about 100 taxi drivers from joining the evening protest in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outside Belgrade, thousands of high school students shunned classes in Nis, Serbia's third largest city, and spilled into the streets, some jumping out of first floor classroom windows in their haste to attend the protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Waving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> banners, they chanted: &quot;Save Serbia and kill yourself, Slobodan,&quot; while taxi drivers blockaded adjoining streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I know why you are not in school today,&quot; Mayor Zoran Zivkovic told the students in Nis. &quot;You refuse to accept injustice!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Yugoslav opposition plans more protests today and tomorrow and civil disobedience backed by a general strike threat to crank up pressure on Milosevic to quit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will continue with the rallies over the weekend and start a general strike on Monday to grind Serbia to a standstill,&quot; Djindjic said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Walkouts, joined by shopkeepers and company employees, were staged in a dozen other cities and towns. Southern Valjevo was completely blocked and thousands protested in Kraljevo. In Novi Sad, state television employees stopped work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A main highway in western Serbia was blocked for one hour by some 60 cabbies as a &quot;warning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also yesterday, Serbia's opposition lodged an official complaint with the Federal Election Commission, providing their own tally that showed Kostunica beat Milosevic 51.34 per cent to 36.22 per cent in Sunday's vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the commission fails to respond to their complaint, the opposition plans to press the case in the country's constitutional court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition said it would dispatch delegations to army headquarters, the interior ministry and Serbian state television with documents proving their election victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An opposition member of the commission, Nebojsa Bakarac, told reporters that Milosevic had falsified more than 100,000 votes from polling places that never opened in Albanian-populated towns in Kosovo and that there was proof of ballots &quot;cast&quot; by dead voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kostunica urged an independent recount of the ballots, appealing &quot;especially to neighbouring Greece.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is more than necessary to count the votes again and examine the entire balloting material,&quot; Kostunica said in a letter made available to the media yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Greece, a NATO member with close cultural and religious ties to Serbia, has suggested the opposition consider the possibility of taking part in the run- off if international election observers are allowed. Bakarac, the commission's opposition member, rejected Greece's initiative, saying the opposition would not bargain with Milosevic on a run-off: &quot;The truth is the truth and it's not negotiable.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbians voted to elect a president yesterday, for the second time in three months. But widespread apathy suggested little prospect of reaching the 50 per cent turnout needed to validate the results. Andrew Gumbel in Belgrade reports on an impasse that can only benefit Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Everybody knew this was going to be a lacklustre campaign. But last Tuesday the whole country was made to realise what pathetic, puerile stuff its prospective future leaders were made of.  Vojislav Seselj, the frontrunner in September's inconclusive poll and a notorious hardline nationalist, held a live television debate with one of his biggest rivals, the erstwhile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaigner Vuk Draskovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At first Mr Seselj, who has a track record of making verbal and physical threats on the small screen, surprised everyone by playing the mature politician, doing his best to sound sweetly reasonable about the depressed economy, the backlog of unpaid pensions and state salaries, and the thorny political question of autonomy for the Albanian-majority province of Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But then Mr Draskovic accused Mr Seselj of being a bad Serb with a suspiciously high proportion of Croatian blood. Mr Seselj looked flustered at first, then threw the same accusation back in Mr Draskovic's face. Since the two men have close family ties, the insults soon became downright personal.  What was supposed to be a debate about the country's future turned into a racist slanging match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The truth is, both men are a severe embarrassment - Mr Seselj because of his rabid political opinions and his tendency to have his opponents beaten up, Mr Draskovic because his claim to represent the democratic opposition that spent last winter marching against the Milosevic regime looks more tenuous every day. Most of the moderates in his party have walked out on him. The rest of the pro-democracy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are boycotting the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That leaves just one other leading contender, the Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic, who is a Milosevic man through and through. But he is also endlessly bland, a poor campaigner and a man with a past as a scourge of anti- establishment intellectuals under Tito.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most likely scenario is another inquorate election, and another round of voting next spring. Without a president, Serbia cannot form a government. The power vacuum leaves just one man with a real job, Mr Milosevic. Although his post as Yugoslav federal president is largely honorary, no one is in a position to challenge his supremacy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SERBIA goes to the polls tomorrow in an election that may be remembered as the one that sealed its wartime pyrrhic victory. A de facto greater Serbia now stretches from the Romanian border to the Adriatic, but it is an impoverished pariah state and is likely to remain so for years to come.  Nobody dares to tell the voters, though.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbia's politicians are spinning dreams, luring the electorate with promises of a strong and wealthy United States of Serbia while the economy crumbles. Inflation will probably top 100,000 per cent for this month alone.  One Belgrade magazine has coined a phrase for this: making reference to Japanese tidal waves, it talks of an ''inflationary tsunami''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As misery engulfs the country, the ruling Socialists promise that peace is imminent and sanctions will soon be lifted. There is no evidence of either.  More extraordinary is the violent lurch to the right by the mainstream opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the summer Vuk Draskovic, the Leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was brutally beaten by police and then detained after a demonstration in Belgrade. Appeals on his behalf came from London and across Europe and he was flown to France for medical treatment. There will be red faces in Europe on Monday if Mr Draskovic comes within a hair's breadth of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic promised tens of thousands in a rally in Belgrade on Wednesday that all the Serb-held territories in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina were part of Serbia and so were Sarajevo and Mostar. Both towns remain to be conquered by Serb forces. He also promised to rip up any peace deals made by Slobodan Milosevic, the Serb President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It had been assumed that Mr Milosevic's Socialists would retain their grip on power, but this is no longer regarded as certain. The surge of support for extreme nationalists in Russia has encouraged the Serbian opposition. So has last Sunday's victory by an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> candidate in Krajina, the Serb-held enclave in Croatia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic is not standing for re-election and his marked lack of support for the Socialists in the campaign leads some to believe he has written them off. There are rumours in Belgrade that he will announce a union of Serbia and Serb-held lands in Croatia and Bosnia, but time is running out for such a move to have an electoral impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some believe that Mr Milosevic is preparing for a period of cohabitation where he continues to rule but confounds the West by presenting it with a democratically elected opposition Government, which makes him look like a moderate on the national question. All sorts of coalitions are also being touted, most of them inherently unstable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the more grotesque, but likely possible combinations, is a Socialist-dominated Government propped up by a new party led by Zeljko Raznjatovic, better known by his nom de guerre: Arkan. The leader of the Tigers during fighting in Bosnia and Croatia is high on most lists of alleged war criminals and is also wanted by the Swedish, German, Dutch and Belgian police. It is alleged that before the war Arkan was a Yugoslav secret service assassin and a bank robber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, Serbs go to the polls tomorrow to celebrate their pyrrhic victory. At the beginning of the war Serbs complained that their fate was always to be winners in war and losers in peace. It is something they believe profoundly and it looks as though it is true once more. Unfortunately it is not a vote winner. More fool Serbia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Clinton administration is deeply divided over Kosovo - albeit behind the scenes. It doesn't know what to do. NATO bombing has not forced Slobodan Milosevic to cave in as expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American officials are desperate to find a way out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, there were signs of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Clinton, after days of near-silence, delivered an impassioned speech about the importance of prevailing in Kosovo. He evoked gruesome examples of the atrocities allegedly being carried out by Serb forces. The clear hint was that he was preparing American opinion for a possible ground intervention. As he was speaking, more army and navy reservists were being called up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That would be a major, and welcome, development, an admission that bombing alone is a failure. Until now, Clinton had seemed paralysed by polls indicating his country could not take too many American soldiers returning in body-bags.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it would not be enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NATO - led by the Americans, who are needed for any solution - should have the imagination, the guts and the determination to go further. It is quite clear to anyone who has even casually studied the Balkans these past few years that there is one root cause of instability in the region. His name is Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the skills of Machiavelli, this evil dictator deliberately stirred nationalism to bring himself to power in 1987. Since then, he has gathered all reins of power in his own hands. He has only a small coterie of advisers whom he constantly changes, setting one against the other to sow fear and distrust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nobody is allowed to come close to challenging his power. Even his top aides are rarely briefed on his negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the years, he has become steadily more repressive. He controls the media which broadcasts a diet of lies and propaganda. On the many occasions his people have come out in demonstrations against him - waving posters comparing him to Saddam Hussein - he has turned his police on them or stirred more war and trouble to distract attention.  The NATO bombing has only strengthened his grip on power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> liberals are out in the streets protesting the bombing. &quot;I am against Milosevic, but I am not against my country,&quot; said one, summing up the sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the broad Serb public, long fed nationalistic propaganda, the bombing has confirmed a historical sense of victimisation - first at the hands of the Turks, then the Nazis, now NATO. It has also facilitated a national denial: as victims, they do not have to take responsibility or even own up to the Kosovo horrors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Serb dictator, meanwhile, has taken advantage of the Kosovo distraction to increase his tyrannical hold at home. He has dismissed dozens of Belgrade university professors who refused to sign a pledge of allegiance to his government, for example. And he has shut down or taken over the last few non -government media outlets - including the wonderful B92 student radio in Belgrade which used to produce spunky reports that told his repression like it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While support for Milosevic in Serbia is a mile wide, however, it is an inch thick. It could easily crumble if Serbs were given a way out, shown a path to the Europe they had keenly wanted to join in the late Eighties and early Nineties, when they saw themselves as part of a democratic wave sweeping across Eastern and Central Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first step to achieve this would be to get rid of Milosevic. NATO should do that by declaring him a war criminal. To suggest that it does not have enough evidence to send him to the Hague is nonsense. The real reason the United States in particular is holding back is because it thinks, as at Dayton, it needs him to be a &quot;guarantor&quot; of peace. But that is a cave-in: setting the stage for him to stir more trouble in, say, his multi-ethnic northern province of Vojvodina or amongst his Muslims in the Sandzak region as soon as he again needs to distract his people's attention to keep his grip on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NATO needs to go further than a Hague indictment, though. Serbs are in no state after 12 years of Milosevic to pick up the physical or psychological pieces on their own. What they need is a Marshall Plan and an allied takeover of the kind that occurred in Germany and Japan after the Second World War.  A high-publicity Nuremberg-style trial of Milosevic and his chief lieutenants would help Serbs face and come to terms with the terrible things that have been committed by some of them and in their name. The institutions needed to build democracy from the ground up could also be installed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, a Harvard historian who wrote Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust has already launched that idea, publishing a manifesto in which he said that Serbia should &quot;be placed in receivership.&quot; Others have taken up the theme. Thomas Alan Schwartz, another American historian, commented that &quot;when Germany was totally defeated, it provided opportunity. You could be physically there, controlling the flow of information and using war-crime trials to show the Germans that atrocities were done in their name.&quot; Without something similar, he said, we can look forward to more trouble in Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What reminds me of Germany is the comparison to the end of World War One,&quot; he added. &quot;Then, the Germans had this powerful sense of being victims. There was a deep resentment that Hitler was able to exploit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will be the same in Serbia when NATO bombing stops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Particularly if the eventual settlement in Kosovo is an unsatisfactory peace deal that leaves Milosevic in power - after, perhaps, caving in to NATO following a ground intervention in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Welcome to Kragujevac: home of the Yugo,&quot; reads a battered sign at the entrance of the city that used to be the Turin of Yugoslavia and is now a symbol of Serbia's gutted economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Crna Zastava (Red Flag) car plants in this city 130 kilometres south of Belgrade turned out up to 220,000 cars a year. The ubiquitous Yugo model briefly competed with other cheap imports in Europe and the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Zastava is hard pressed to produce 10,000 cars a year. Last year thousands of workers went on strike and in November Veroljub Stevanovic, the managing director sacked in 1992, was elected mayor for the opposition Zajedno </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His was one of many opposition election victories whose attempted annulment by Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's president, sparked three months of nationwide demonstrations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disintegration of former Yugoslavia and four years of trade sanctions against Serbia severed access to markets, raw materials and components, dealing a near-lethal blow to dozens of plants like Zastava.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade sanctions were lifted last year in return for Serbian compliance with the Dayton peace agreements, which ended the war in Bosnia. But financial sanctions that bar Serbia from membership in the International Monetary Fund and access to international capital markets remain in force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The collapse of Zastava has created huge social problems for the one-company town. &quot;Over 70,000 are waiting for a job, another 30,000 are on enforced 'vacation' and the population is swollen with 5,000 Serb refugees,&quot; Stevanovic says. &quot;This city has the greatest social problems in Europe.&quot; The mayor believes Zastava could be revived, but only with foreign investment and new management to replace the party hacks put in when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dissidents like him were sacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Executives from Hyundai, Renault and Fiat itself have all looked around recently. We know there are too many workers and there will have to be retrenchments. But the real problem is that the communists are still in power -- and that is simply not attractive to anyone,&quot; Stevanovic says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 50 km from Belgrade, in the steel town of Smederevo, life is significantly different. The steel complex was always a heavy loss maker. But it received much investment in the early 1980s, although the plant was closed when sanctions were imposed in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet unlike Kragujevac with its opposition mayor, Smederevo's managers smoothly switched allegiance from the Communist party to Milosevic. With this level of political support, workers at Smederevo continued to receive their pay during the four years until it reopened last year. The plant is expected to produce 1.2 million tonnes of steel products this year, mostly for export.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The export drive reflects both depressed domestic demand and the government's need for hard currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbia's trade deficit was more than US$ 1 billion last year and rising. &quot;The problem is that Serbia's biggest exporters are also its biggest importers. The more they produce the bigger the deficit,&quot; worries Goran Pitic, head of research at Belgrade's Economics Institute. Danica Popovic, at the rival Centre for Economic Studies, adds: &quot;There is no economic strategy and that means there is no direction at the micro level at all. The people that run plants like Smederevo and Zastava are apparatchiks, not managers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Popovic is skeptical of the government's new-found belief in privatization, noting that 96% of the country's assets are still in state hands. But about 35% of economic output is produced by the private sector, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbian industry is still working at only 36% capacity against 73% in 1989. Serbia has survived by consuming its capital, including the estimated US$ 4 billion in effect stolen from private hard currency accounts in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic cost of Milosovic's failed attempt to create a Greater Serbia is borne by ordinary Serbs whose average annual income has fallen by more than 50% to about US$ 1,500 since 1990. But while Serbia has stagnated in isolation, other former Yugoslav republics, especially Slovenia and Croatia, have forged ahead with economic stabilization and privatization. They have created strong, convertible currencies backed by growing foreign currency reserves and attracted foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbia's best hopes for economic recovery lie in restoring economic and trade links with these independent states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even under the most optimistic assumptions, however, Serbia faces a struggle to rebuild its economy. It will no longer receive a share of Slovenia's export revenues or the hard currency tourist receipts of Croatia, both of which helped to sustain it in the days of federal Yugoslavia. And as long as Milosevic remains in control, it will also be hamstrung by financial sanctions.</SPAN></P>

Last year thousands of workers went on strike and in November Veroljub Stevanovic, the managing director sacked in 1992, was elected mayor for the opposition Zajedno </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His was one of many opposition election victories whose attempted annulment by Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's president, sparked three months of nationwide demonstrations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disintegration of former Yugoslavia and four years of trade sanctions against Serbia severed access to markets, raw materials and components, dealing a near-lethal blow to dozens of plants like Zastava.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trade sanctions were lifted last year in return for Serbian compliance with the Dayton peace agreements, which ended the war in Bosnia. But financial sanctions that bar Serbia from membership in the International Monetary Fund and access to international capital markets remain in force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The collapse of Zastava has created huge social problems for the one-company town. ''Over 70,000 are waiting for a job, another 30,000 are on enforced 'vacation' and the population is swollen with 5,000 Serb refugees,'' Stevanovic says. ''This city has the greatest social problems in Europe.'' The mayor believes Zastava could be revived, but only with foreign investment and new management to replace the party hacks put in when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dissidents like him were sacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''Executives from Hyundai, Renault and Fiat itself have all looked around recently. We know there are too many workers and there will have to be retrenchments. But the real problem is that the communists are still in power -- and that is simply not attractive to anyone,'' Stevanovic says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only 50 km from Belgrade, in the steel town of Smederevo, life is significantly different. The steel complex was always a heavy loss maker. But it received much investment in the early 1980s, although the plant was closed when sanctions were imposed in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet unlike Kragujevac with its opposition mayor, Smederevo's managers smoothly switched allegiance from the Communist party to Milosevic. With this level of political support, workers at Smederevo continued to receive their pay during the four years until it reopened last year. The plant is expected to produce 1.2 million tonnes of steel products this year, mostly for export.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The export drive reflects both depressed domestic demand and the government's need for hard currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbia's trade deficit was more than US$1 billion last year and rising. ''The problem is that Serbia's biggest exporters are also its biggest importers. The more they produce the bigger the deficit,'' worries Goran Pitic, head of research at Belgrade's Economics Institute. Danica Popovic, at the rival Centre for Economic Studies, adds: ''There is no economic strategy and that means there is no direction at the micro level at all. The people that run plants like Smederevo and Zastava are apparatchiks, not managers.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Popovic is skeptical of the government's new-found belief in privatization, noting that 96% of the country's assets are still in state hands. But about 35% of economic output is produced by the private sector, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbian industry is still working at only 36% capacity against 73% in 1989. Serbia has survived by consuming its capital, including the estimated US$4 billion in effect stolen from private hard currency accounts in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The economic cost of Milosovic's failed attempt to create a Greater Serbia is borne by ordinary Serbs whose average annual income has fallen by more than 50% to about US$1,500 since 1990. But while Serbia has stagnated in isolation, other former Yugoslav republics, especially Slovenia and Croatia, have forged ahead with economic stabilization and privatization. They have created strong, convertible currencies backed by growing foreign currency reserves and attracted foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbia's best hopes for economic recovery lie in restoring economic and trade links with these independent states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even under the most optimistic assumptions, however, Serbia faces a struggle to rebuild its economy. It will no longer receive a share of Slovenia's export revenues or the hard currency tourist receipts of Croatia, both of which helped to sustain it in the days of federal Yugoslavia. And as long as Milosevic remains in control, it will also be hamstrung by financial sanctions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAPLJE SELO, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wheat is ready for harvest, but the combines are out of gas and the Serb farmers are scared to work the fields. They sit in the shade of a cherry tree, cursing war and drinking homemade brandy until their wives collect them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just beyond them, NATO troops patrol narrow roads. Returning ethnic Albanian refugees seek revenge for years of Serb oppression. There seems to be no safe place. And the men are angry that the Kosovo land their families have farmed for generations is suddenly in jeopardy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brandy stops flowing and words grow more bitter when someone mentions Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. The Serb farmers of Laplje Selo, like increasing numbers of people in their country, despise him. They blame Milosevic for plundering a country and twisting Serb nationalism into a sin that triggered NATO airstrikes and saddled a bankrupt Yugoslavia with $40 billion worth of ruin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A crook,&quot; one farmer says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Evil,&quot; another says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disdain sweeps country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disdain for Milosevic is sweeping Yugoslavia. Elderly Serbs surviving on pensions of $22 a month marched against Milosevic last week in Belgrade. Tens of thousands of others -- including underpaid soldiers -- joined </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies in Cacak and other cities, demanding his resignation. The Serbian Orthodox Church has called for him to step down. Crown Prince Alexander, heir to Yugoslavia's exiled monarchy, described Milosevic as a &quot;monster&quot; who &quot;must go, for the sake of Yugoslavia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surge of opposition is reminiscent of 1996, when students and intellectuals protested Milosevic's corrupt government and militant nationalism that was tugging Yugoslavia further away from Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic outlasted his detractors, dividing opposition leaders and strengthening his power. Some diplomats predict Milosevic will escape defeat again, but many Serbs say their president has shamed them for the last time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's the traitor to Serb nationalism,&quot; said Momcilo Trajkovic, president of the Serbian Democratic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a small opposition party founded by Trajkovic in his hometown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a stunning reversal of fortune, the Serbs, who once controlled Kosovo with paramilitary police, are increasingly vulnerable to ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population. The Serbs of Laplje Selo don't like the odds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across Kosovo, ethnic Albanians are looting and burning Serb homes. Serbs are winding up dead on roadsides. More than 80,000 of Kosovo's 200,000 Serbs have fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of Laplje Selo's 2,000 residents are staying put, though many farmers have sent their wives and children away until tensions ease. And a few village leaders, such as the baker, Stojan Nedeljkovic, are packing cars and tractors with furniture and clothes, just in case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remaining in the village is difficult, as farmers such as Zika Jovic can't sell summer squash and other vegetables because ethnic Albanians are boycotting Serb products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We're scared'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one wants our cheese, bread or vegetables,&quot; Jovic said. &quot;We have to give it to the cows to eat. I have to sell eggs to buy cigarettes, but now I can't even go to the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're scared. We're like prisoners. Milosevic promised so much. But we have nothing. There's not even room for us in Serbia if we leave Kosovo. The wars Milosevic started in Bosnia and Croatia have already flooded the country with Serb refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West of the Kosovo capital of Pristina, where the land flattens, Laplje Selo is marked by the silver domes of St. Sveta Petka church. The cemetery is wild with weeds and shiny with black granite markers, some bearing the names -- as folklore has it -- of those cursed to die young because their parents once sold land to Albanians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Centuries ago, Serbs battled the Turks for this land. Then came the Germans. And last summer, 200 village men grabbed rifles and formed night patrols to protect 1,500 acres of wheat from guerrillas in the Kosovo Liberation Army. They feared the KLA might torch the fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down the road at the village's co-operative farm office, the combines needed gasoline. War disrupted supplies, and farmers say Albanians are selling to Serbs at highly inflated prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Momcilo Trajkovic, the president of the Serbian Democratic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said: &quot;I feel the anger of Albanians. But now there is a tragedy against the Serbs, and NATO is doing little to stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remembering 1389</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slavoljub Mitic stopped at Zivko Nacic's general store for a beer. Rain, sweeping across the wheat fields, chased him and other men under a corrugated tin roof. They sat, listened to thunder, joked about NATO cluster bombs and talked about 1389, when Serbian Prince Lazar battled the Turks on Kosovo's Field of Blackbirds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lazar's army was defeated and he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But every Serb child is taught the poem about the epic battle, the bravery, the religious devotion, and the myths that sprang from Kosovo. Mitic remembersin 1989 when Milosevic traveled to Kosovo and ignited his political career by extolling Serb nationalism and the virtues of the prince.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mitic said Milosevic is no Lazar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need changes in Yugoslavia,&quot; Mitic said. &quot;We need Milosevic out. He lost Bosnia. He lost Croatia. Now, he's lost Kosovo. He lost it all. It's over. . . . Kosovo is the Serbian soul. Milosevic will be remembered in history for losing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two heavily armed NATO soldiers walked past. Mitic and the others watched them round the bend in the road. Some of the men worried that NATO is not protecting their village, and many fear attacks from ethnic Albanians if they go to harvest their wheat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must do this harvest no matter what the fear,&quot; Rade Djorovic said. &quot;My family has been here for centuries. I have never missed a harvest. Fear has never kept us out of the fields.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JACK KELLEY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SERBIA'S most powerful opposition leader has warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that Serbs &quot;are ready to spill their blood&quot; if he does not resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Civil war, chaos and bloodshed are just around the corner if his regime does not step down peacefully,&quot; Vuk Draskovic said. &quot;I, with the people, am ready to act. We demand a new future, and Milosevic is not part of it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ultimatum came amid a growing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wave across the country this weekend. Opposition parties hope it will gain enough momentum for a march on the capital by the end of the month. Army reservists took to the streets in two towns on Friday demanding to be paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of people have signed anti-government petitions across the country and thousands more attended rallies calling for the Yugoslav president to step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost a month after NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia ended, the groundswell against the defiant Yugoslav president is building steadily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kraljevo, 120km south of Belgrade, more than 10,000 protesters rallied to demand Milosevic's resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoran Djindic, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, told the rally: &quot;Milosevic has nowhere to run.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nis, south-west of the capital, hundreds of reservists occupied a square to demand pay for serving during the bombing, and decent treatment of military victims and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four more town councils in Serbia passed resolutions calling on Milosevic to resign, making a total of 11, but his allies have vowed to use force to stop protests. They have destroyed pro-democracy petitions, smashed tables where opposition leaders have collected signatures and arrested protest leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will defend ourselves against the protesting moral scum,&quot; said Yugoslav Left spokesman Ivan Markovic. &quot;We cannot let the traitors win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the threats, Mr Draskovic, who mobilised tens of thousands of Serbs for demonstrations against Milosevic in the winter of 1996-97, said he believed &quot;the time is right&quot; for a mass </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reyes inadvertently disclosed the payments at a cabinet meeting led by President Joseph Estrada, who immediately cut the session short because of the presence of journalists. &quot;We can talk about that privately, not in this forum,&quot; Estrada said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Philippines formally refuses to pay ransoms, and officials have never publicly confirmed that large amounts were paid to Abu Sayyaf, a small group of rebels fighting for an independent Muslim state in the southern Philippines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE--Formalizing a breach in opposition ranks, a coalition seeking to oust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Sept. 24 elections nominated its own candidate, the third challenger to Milosevic thus far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most opposition parties in Serbia--Yugoslavia's dominant republic--endorsed Vojislav Kostunica, candidate of the small, center-right Democratic Party of Serbia.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 200-page study, by the human rights office of Guatemala's Roman Catholic archdiocese, interviewed parents and relatives of some of the more than 400 children it says disappeared. Most were lost in Guatemala's western highlands in the early 1980s, as leftist guerrillas fought army troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This report aims to prevent such . . . pain and suffering from occurring again in Guatemala,&quot; the office coordinator, Bishop Mario Rios Montt, told reporters. Rios Montt's predecessor, Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi, was bludgeoned to death in 1998, the day after his office released a report blaming the army for the majority of wartime atrocities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new report said abductions were committed almost exclusively by the army, but in a few cases by pro-government paramilitary groups or leftist guerrillas. Other children became separated from their parents while fleeing combatants, it said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SERB opposition leader Vuk Draskovic yesterday claimed a car crash he was involved in at the weekend was an assassination attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The accident, which claimed the lives of four of his entourage, occurred as mass demonstrations against the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic took place throughout Serbia for the 13th consecutive day, bringing tens of thousands of people out on to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic, president of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO), said the car in which he was travelling swerved off the road to avoid hitting a truck.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The car his security team was travelling in hit the truck head-on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are talking about an obvious assassination attempt, and with God's will everybody was killed but myself,&quot; Mr Draskovic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Let those who carried it out reflect well on what will happen to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic was slightly injured in the accident, which happened near Lazarevac, 40km south of Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Killed in the accident were Mr Draskovic's security chief, Zvonko Osmajlic; two other members of the security team, Dragan Vusurevic and Vusur Rakocevic; and Mr Draskovic's brother-in-law Veselin Boskovic, an official in the Belgrade municipality. &quot;The truck suddenly, without any reason ... switched to our side of the road and it was clear to me that it had intended to kill me,&quot; Mr Draskovic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Borivoje Borovic, a member of the SPO's directorate, said visibility was good, the road was straight and that the truck driver disappeared after the crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An investigating magistrate said the truck had been driving on the wrong side of the road at the time of the collision &quot;for reasons yet unknown&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, amid daily signs of dissent on the streets of Yugoslavia, Zoran Djindjic, head of the Democratic Party and a central figure in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies, yesterday claimed Mr Milosevic planned to provoke violence at street protests to create a pretext for a crackdown on opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are secret plans ... to stage an incident in which a number of policemen would be hurt, to put the blame on opposition, reshape public opinion and then move to arrest protest leaders, ban the rallies and introduce a form of emergency situation,&quot; Mr Djindjic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Djindjic, who has always advocated peaceful protests, said he knew of the plan from insiders close to Mr Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I hope that people in the police and the army are alert to this ... Milosevic applied such tactics in (the wars) in Croatia, Bosnia, in Kosovo ... to provoke violence, push people into bloodshed and then play the peacemaker.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRUSSELS March 12</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, chief organizer of the October 2000 democratic revolution that toppled Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, was shot and killed today by snipers as he approached the door of his government headquarters in Belgrade. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Serbian government immediately declared a state of emergency, suspending all political activity in the Balkan republic of 10 million people and reintroducing rigid controls on the news media. Police officers and army troops began a massive hunt for Djindjic's killers, setting up roadblocks around the capital and halting all bus, rail and plane traffic out of the city. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late in the day, the government said the killing was the work of a criminal gang whose leaders include Milorad Lukovic, the former head of an elite paramilitary police unit called the Red Berets. &quot;The assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic represents an attempt by this group to stop the fight against organized crime that just started and for them to avoid their own arrest,&quot; the government said in a statement. It did not offer evidence to support that claim. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic was one of Washington's closest allies in the region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> News media in Belgrade reported that two men were taken into custody.  The murder plunged Serbia into a political crisis following 21/2 years of democratic rule and more than a half-century of authoritarianism, first under the Communists, then under Milosevic, a Communist-turned-Serbian nationalist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Serbian observers said there was no obvious replacement for Djindjic. &quot;He was the person who held everything together -- cutting deals, twisting arms, buying other parties out,&quot; said Ljiljana Smajlovic, a leading political commentator. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic and Vojislav Kostunica, his rival and collaborator in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that toppled Milosevic, dominated Serbian politics for the past two years. Kostunica, who succeeded Milosevic as president of Yugoslavia and stepped down earlier this month when the country was restructured into a looser federation called Serbia and Montenegro, remains a highly popular figure in Serbia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The assassination bore the marks of a professional killing and a well-organized conspiracy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic, using crutches because of a sports injury, was struck in the abdomen and back by two bullets from high-powered rifles as he walked the few steps from his armored automobile to a door at his headquarters. Police said multiple snipers apparently fired from the third floor of an abandoned building across the street. Another bullet hit Djindjic's car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was rushed to a hospital alive. But he died there at 1:30 p.m. Belgrade time, the government said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic narrowly survived an apparent assassination attempt last month when a truck swerved into his convoy of cars. He blamed the incident on organized crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In just over two years as Serbian prime minister, Djindjic made powerful enemies, including ousted Communist and nationalist leaders, criminals and dissident factions in the secret police and army. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic was particularly detested by people close to the former, post-Communist government for giving in to intense Western pressure and extraditing Milosevic and several of his close associates to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a long tradition of political assassinations in Serbia, which was the largest republic in Yugoslavia, a six-nation federation that disintegrated in bloody civil wars lasting through most of the 1990s. Gangland killings and political murders became common toward the end of Milosevic's long rule, as criminal groups vied for control over the economy and the government lashed out at political enemies. Such killings continued after Milosevic's fall. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbia's deputy prime minister, Nebojsa Covic, decried &quot;a clear attempt by those who in the past have tried to stop Serbia's progress and democratization by assassinations to change the course of history and once again isolate Serbia.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Stipe Mesic of Croatia, which broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991, described the murder as &quot;an act of madness&quot; that would slow Serbia's progress toward democracy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic's willingness to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal, and his attempts to introduce market-oriented economic changes, made him a favorite of Western governments, including the United States.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement today, President Bush said: &quot;History will remember Prime Minister Djindjic for his strong leadership during Serbia's successful struggle to end the dictatorship of Slobodan Milosevic. . . . At the helm of the new government, Prime Minister Djindjic was committed to building a prosperous, democratic future for Serbia.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic led a 17-member coalition that had a tenuous majority in parliament following the splintering of the reform coalition that toppled Milosevic. He had earlier fallen out with Kostunica, his principal ally in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The emergency regulations, commentator Smajlovic said, mean Djindjic's allies will be able to rule by decree for a limited time. But the coalition of small parties is seen by analysts to lack political legitimacy, and would almost certainly be defeated in any election. Under Serbia's constitution, the acting president will nominate a successor to Djindjic, subject to parliament's approval. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, YUGOSLAVIA</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a direct challenge to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian opposition leader Zoran Djindjic returned to Belgrade yesterday from self-imposed exile, declaring he preferred the risk of prison to the prospect of civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe we must, as democrats, do all (we can) to avoid the risk of civil war in this country,&quot; the 46-year-old president of Serbia's Democratic Party told reporters and dozens of cheering supporters moments after he landed at Belgrade's airport on a flight from the neighbouring republic of Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic, who said he left Serbia on May 10 amid death threats from paramilitary forces at the height of NATO's air war, added: &quot;But I don't believe Milosevic can take the risk to arrest me and provoke protests around Serbia.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition leader's homecoming, after weeks of touring Europe to condemn Milosevic's regime and garner postwar support for opposition-ruled Serbian towns, appeared to have presented the Yugoslav president with a lose-lose situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For days, Belgrade's state-run media had stressed that Djindjic faced criminal charges if he returned, for draft-dodging and &quot;failure to report a change of address&quot; after he fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">oThose charges carry prison terms ranging from two months to 20 years. Analysts here said a failure to arrest Djindjic would be seen by many as a sign of weakness by Milosevic's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the arrest of a leader whose party is at the vanguard of nascent street protests in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, would be viewed as a harsh crackdown on pro-democracy forces at a time when Milosevic and his nation are already isolated from European neighbours and the rest of the free world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OUTNUMBERED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Djindjic strode past the uniformed Serbian police officers who had deployed in strength for his arrival, the opposition leader gave credit for his unscathed return to the assembled reporters and camera operators, who far outnumbered the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he fired his first salvo against the Yugoslav president: &quot;Most people know the reality. With Milosevic in power, Serbia hasn't a future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic brushed aside the deep divisions among Serbia's major pro-democracy parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people are united,&quot; he insisted. &quot;The change must be democratic, not radical and extreme. And the opposition and the Alliance for Change (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coalition) are strong enough to take the direction for change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the rift between his party and the larger Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of sometime opposition leader Vuk Draskovic, who has told his party members not to attend the Alliance for Change rallies that began last week, he said: &quot;It's not up to me. It's up to Mr. Draskovic. ... I'm ready to forget the past. We have a lot to do in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man once considered a mouthpiece for Slobodan Milosevic has suddenly upstaged the Yugoslav president by suggesting that NATO troops could play a role in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Premier Vuk Draskovic said Monday that Yugoslavia would accept a UN peacekeeping force for Kosovo that could include soldiers from NATO countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, Draskovic said both Milosevic and Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin shared the same view in his separate conversations with them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But yesterday, he pulled back. Asked by reporters if he and Milosevic specifically talked about whether such a force should be armed, he said: &quot;We did not discuss this.&quot; That cast doubt on his assertion that Milosevic has accepted the concept of NATO troops in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a stance would mark a huge concession by Milosevic, who has steadily rejected the idea of any foreign armed forces in Kosovo, especially from &quot;aggressor countries,&quot; his term for NATO members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic would only say yesterday that Milosevic would accept a UN-sponsored force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think President Milosevic is ready, and must be ready, to accept a Security Council resolution,&quot; he said. &quot;Our obligation is to accept a UN Security Council resolution. They will decide the composition of the force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic said nothing could be implemented until NATO stopped bombing and Yugoslav troops in Kosovo withdrew to the positions they held before the air strikes began over a month ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. and its allies continue to insist on a strong NATO-led force in Kosovo as part of any peace settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Milosevic, Draskovic and Moscow are indeed of one mind, and Milosevic is using his deputy premier to unveil a new stand on Kosovo, then the two sides are closer than at any time since air strikes began March 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Draskovic has a track record for unpredictability. His recent comments appear to be less a change in the thinking of the Yugoslav regime than an attempt to distance himself from Milosevic and position himself as a possible alternative to the Yugoslav president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he joined Milosevic's government in January, the flamboyant former opposition leader was accused of selling out by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, Draskovic was once beaten by Milosevic's police and played a key role in anti-government protests in 1996 and 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many, he turned into Milosevic's moderate voice once he joined the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the start of the bombing campaign, Draskovic's language was pro-Serbian, but low-key compared to others in the Milosevic camp, who compared NATO to Nazis and U.S. President Bill Clinton to Adolf Hitler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he broke that mold on the weekend. In an interview with Studio B -- his party's television station -- the bearded firebrand suddenly condemned both the Yugoslav leadership and its propaganda campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stop lying to the people in Serbia, and finally tell them the truth,&quot; he said. &quot;The people should be told that NATO is not facing a breakdown, that Russia will not help Yugoslavia militarily, and that the world public opinion is against us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In later interviews, he insisted he was not targeting Milosevic but criticizing hardline nationalists grouped around the other deputy prime minister, Vojislav Seselj.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HITLER'S Henchmen (SBS, 8.30pm, 8pm SA) reaches its conclusion tonight with a profile of Karl Doenitz, Hitler's Admiral of the Fleet and successor. True to its high standard, this impeccably researched series finds both witnesses and historical footage showing that while Doenitz may be the least notorious of Hitler's main men, he was personally one of the most barbaric, the ultimate shadow minister, wrapped in servility and so desperate to infiltrate Hitler's circle of trustees that he drove his U-Boat fleet to ruthless victories merely to impress his Fuhrer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when he realised that Hitler was only impressed by victories on land, he stepped up his vicious U-Boat attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid all the explosive footage of U-Boat bombings comes a shocking statistic: of 39,000 U-Boat sailors, 28,000 died.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doenitz is revealed to be a hard man, with a passion for weaponry, gadgetry and idolatry. As this excellent series ends, it leaves viewers with the impression of the Nazi party as a hellish boys club, each member pathetically in awe of a madman, and intentionally alerts the viewer to the facility with which Hitler was able to mobilise a nation under a banner of hate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While it is definitely accurate to say that Bourbon Street in New Orleans is one of the ugliest strips of neonand liquor-drenched bars in the world, once a year its Mardi Gras festival transforms it into an ugly neon strip bursting at the seams with revelry, glitter and more excess than usual. Cutting Loose (SBS 11.05pm, 10.35pm SA) covers the weeks of meticulous preparation the city undergoes in the lead-up to the big event, spending time with spangly local low-lifes as they stitch, tease and thread their way to sub-Vegas glamour and glitz. Winner of the best cinematography and filmmakers trophy at The Sundance Film Festival, it captures another drunken, flashy global spectacle without making you wish you were there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Correspondent (ABC, 9.30pm), Australia's most uncompromising and best researched current affairs show returns for its sixth season tonight, with George Negus (pictured) again filling the hot seat, and a typically strong round of global reporting. First off is a report from Indonesia on the spate of violent rioting that has besieged the country -3 per cent of the population are Chinese yet they control 75 per cent of the wealth, and most of the riot attacks have been on the Chinese. Eric Campbell infiltrates the Belgrade student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to report on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> revolution and finds a society once reviled as warmongers now potentially taking its first steps towards democracy. Finally, there's a delightful Postcard segment on a Melbourne tram driver who, upon seeing that Calcutta shared the same tramway system on a holiday, made it his work to salvage the Calcutta trams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its cliffhanger last season, Mad About You (Ten, 7.30pm) took the drastic step of leaving its maniacally monogamous twosome teetering on the edge of divorce (which in this couple-crazed comedy is the equivalent of the apocalypse).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight the embattled enamorados have to sort out the fallout of infidelity (she only kissed a guy, for heck's sake), and they do so in a surprisingly dramatic and powerful park-bench argument scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this scene, backed by a strong script, Helen Hunt (pictured) reveals considerable acting talent and again proves she is the show's linchpin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Reiser sticks to his limpid schmuck schtick (one of the show's main deterrents -he's horrible). Ed Asner appears as an amusingly crass father-inlaw, a role that inadvertently makes the point that Mad About You's greatest strength has always been its inventive casting and writing of the peripheral roles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On exactly the same day, one year apart, the cities of Los Angeles and Kobe were hit by huge earthquakes of almost identical magnitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difference between the two quakes was the death toll: The LA quake, with its epicentre located in Northbridge, north of the city, took 57 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kobe, the quake struck the city centre, devastating the entire city and residential blocks, killing 5400 people. The Day the Earth Shook (SBS, 8.30pm, 8pm SA) brings home both the horror of the Kobe quake and the unbelievable good luck of its LA counterpart with scenes captured in Japan by security surveillance cameras in offices and convenience stores at the peak of the quake -desks literally slam from wall to wall as the earth heaves in every direction. Seismologists then use this video evidence to ascertain what type of construction fares better under quake conditions, extrapolating the secure </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of a potato chip display stand into safer interior furnishing for homes in quake zones. And since millions of dollars in seismic equipment failed to predict either earthquake, scientists are looking into natural detection devices, which seem to be implanted in every dog, bird and cat.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before landing in Belgrade, I wonder what Canadians might think of when they think about Serbia - the homeland of tennis aces Novak Djokovic and Jelena Jankovic, of soccer star Nemanja Vidic of Manchester United, and of world champion basketball teams. Also the land where 250,000 civilians were ethnically cleansed in the 1990s, where Canadian peacekeepers went to keep a non-existent peace, where NATO mounted a 78-day air war in 1999, and where Slobodan Milosevic was eventually overthrown in 2000 and sent off to the war crimes tribunal at The Hague, after which President Boris Tadic, a moderate democrat, has turned the pariah state into a credible candidate for membership in the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few days later, I watch Tadic welcome the annual congress of PEN International, the writers' group. He speaks extempore and well. Acknowledging the past, he says Serbia is trying to get along with the constituent parts of the former Yugoslavia that went their separate ways - Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Montenegro.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What about Kosovo?&quot; mutter some impolite writers, about the Serbian refusal to accept the state that declared independence in 2008. Tadic does not hear, or pretends not to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kosovo - the home of &quot;sacred Serb sites,&quot; dating back to the Ottoman times - is a taboo topic. Even the seemingly apolitical Djokovic, known for clowning on the court, has strong views on the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tadic must pay lip service to nationalism and even subsidize the Serb enclave in northern Kosovo abutting Serbia. He also expresses rhetorical solidarity with the much larger Serbian enclave in Bosnia, called Republika Srpska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he must not inflame passions. That's the EU requirement for Serbia's possible membership, along with the demand, already fulfilled, of handing over war criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A majority of Serbs, 53 per cent, want to join the EU (as per a poll taken before the current euro crisis). Nearly 60 per cent accept that Kosovo is lost. But there's still a constituency - conservative, Orthodox - that thinks of Russia, historic ally against the Ottomans, as a better alternative to Europe. This crowd includes young rednecks with tattoos of the cross and Saint Lazar, the 14th century prince of Serbia who waged the Battle of Kosovo against the Ottomans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians do not want to take on the nationalists, at least not until after the next election due in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The past is so painful that people want to forget and get on with life,&quot; says Vida Ognjenovic. &quot;But one must go back and dwell on it and learn the lessons that need to be learned.&quot; She is a historic figure - a playwright, drama professor and co-founder of the Democratic party that was in the vanguard of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1991, she was artistic director of the National Theatre in Belgrade when 50,000 protesters filled the square in front of the 19th century building. But there was a ban on public speaking. She invited the leaders of the march in and let them use the second floor balcony to address the crowd, using the theatre's sound system. She was promptly fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was when leading members of the Orthodox Church and the world of academe supported Milosevic and his criminal gangs. They have had a lot to live down since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet other intellectuals feel they were &quot;misled and manipulated, and feel complicit, too,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the majority population, it paid the price of world opprobrium and economic sanctions. The young left in droves. Some saw sports as a way out, most famously using empty, financially drained swimming pools for tennis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bruised national psyche is also shaped by the famous Serbian characteristic of inat (ee-nat), stubbornness to the point of being detrimental to one's own interest or, positively, forbearance against heavy odds, as in war or sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversations with Serbs - in Belgrade's bustling sidewalk cafes and in the countless bookstores that dot street corners and at literary festivals - reveal a conflicted people: Yes, something terrible happened but it happened because Croats, Bosnians and Kosovars were doing bad things to us. They, too, committed war crimes, yet we got punished more. And now the European Union is pushing us around, as a price of entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to work up sympathy for any of this, especially given the public reaction even this year to the arrest of war criminal Ratko Mladic, the butcher of Bosnia. He was hailed a hero, as had been Milosevic during his televised trial at The Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such is the milieu that Serbia's democrats must traverse. To their credit, they are traversing it well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- In a direct challenge to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian opposition leader Zoran Djindjic returned from self-imposed exile yesterday, declaring that he preferred the risk of prison to the prospect of civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I believe we must, as democrats, do all (we can) to avoid the risk of civil war in this country,'' the 46-year-old president of Serbia's Democratic Party told reporters and dozens of cheering supporters moments after he landed at Belgrade's airport on a flight from the neighbouring republic of Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic, who said he left Serbia on May 10 amid death threats from paramilitary forces at the height of NATO's air war, added: ''But I don't believe Milosevic can take the risk to arrest me and provoke protests around Serbia.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition leader's homecoming, after weeks of touring Europe to condemn Mr. Milosevic's regime and garner postwar support for opposition-ruled Serbian towns, appeared to have presented the Yugoslav president with a lose-lose situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For days, Belgrade's state-run media had stressed that Mr. Djindjic faced criminal charges if he returned: for draft-dodging and ''failure to report a change of address'' after he fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those charges carry prison terms ranging from two months to 20 years, and analysts in Belgrade said a failure to arrest Mr. Djindjic would be seen by many as a sign of weakness on the part of Mr. Milosevic's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the arrest of a leader whose party is at the vanguard of nascent street protests in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, would be viewed as a harsh crackdown on pro-democracy forces at a time when Mr. Milosevic and his nation are already isolated from their European neighbours and the rest of the free world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr. Djindjic strode past the uniformed Serbian police officers who had deployed in strength for his arrival, the opposition leader gave credit for his unscathed return to the assembled reporters and camera operators, who far outnumbered the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he fired his first salvo against the Yugoslav president: ''Most people know the reality. With Milosevic in power, Serbia hasn't a future.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic brushed aside the deep divisions among Serbia's major pro-democracy parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The people are united,'' he insisted. ''The change must be democratic, not radical and extreme. And the opposition and the Alliance for Change (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coalition) are strong enough to take the direction for change.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the rift between his party and the larger Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of opposition leader Vuk Draskovic, who has told his party members not to attend the Alliance for Change rallies that began last week, he said: ''It's not up to me. It's up to Mr. Draskovic. ... I'm ready to forget the past. We have a lot to do in the future.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A defiant Yugoslav strongman Slobodan Milosevic signaled yesterday he won't step down from power and blamed efforts to force his resignation on NATO &quot;aggression&quot; and &quot;corrupt&quot; local pols.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking out for the first time since mass protests against his regime erupted across Serbia a month ago, the embattled leader threw down the gauntlet against his foes, and other allies signaled a long and possibly violent struggle lies ahead between Milosevic and his internal opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meeting with a group of migr Serbs, Milosevic said NATO, &quot;with the help of various corrupt politicians and political parties, is trying to undermine our stability from within and realize in this manner the aims it failed to do with 22,000 tons of bombs fired on our country.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be sad if the extended hand of the evil which NATO committed against our country was a hand of our own citizens,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am certain that this will not happen, I am certain that patriotism and love for the homeland will prevail over treason,&quot; Milosevic added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more ominous was a speech given by Serbia's Interior Minister Vlajko Stojiljkovic, who has been indicted by the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal along with Milosevic, warning that he might unleash his dreaded &quot;MUP&quot; - the same storm troopers who terrorized ethnic Albanians in Kosovo - on Serbian anti-government protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> forces threaten to destabilize the state, Stojiljkovic warned &quot;police will act in keeping with the constitution and law and take measures to protect all citizens and property as well as their right to a free and safe life and work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strong words from Milosevic and his allies come at a time when opposition to his regime is spreading in the wake of the 11-week NATO bombing campaign, which ruined Serbia's infrastructure and economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton administration and other NATO countries have been giving covert help to Serbian opposition groups and are saying publicly that there will be no wartime reconstruction aid to Serbia as long as Milosevic remains in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressure on the Serb leader is expected to increase in the next few weeks with plans by the government of Yugoslavian province Montenegro to break free of Serbia's dominance and plans for a major demonstration by the Serbian Orthodox Church and a coalition of opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Balkan analysts see the latest developments as a sign that Milosevic is growing increasingly alarmed about the internal turmoil surrounding his 10-year rule and plans to fight back against his opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's trying to derail this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and to discredit the opposition. I think the fact that he had to make a statement himself indicates that he takes these demonstrations very seriously,&quot; said Kurt Basseuner of the Balkans Action Council, a Washington-based think tank.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blocking roads and shutting down shops, movie theaters and coal mines, tens of thousands of Yugoslavs heeded opposition calls for a nationwide strike Friday to force President Slobodan Milosevic to step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As opposition leaders explained the campaign to 25,000 supporters in Belgrade's main square, students rallied in the country's south, shopkeepers closed down in the east and television workers cut off transmissions in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition called the protests to pressure Milosevic to admit that challenger Vojislav Kostunica won Sunday's presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic admits he finished second, but his government says no candidate won a majority so an Oct. 8 runoff is necessary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cease your work, come out and stay on the streets so that this country will find its path to (the) future,&quot; opposition leader Zoran Djindjic told the Belgrade crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Serbia must stop for us to unload Milosevic out of a seat he no longer has a right to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbia and the smaller Montenegro make up Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actors guild declared a strike, and most theater and cinema owners said they would shut down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several roads were blocked in northern and southern parts of Serbia, and over 7,000 coal miners stopped work in Kolubara, 25 miles south of Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two protests, one in the afternoon and the other in the evening, attracted a total of 50,000 people to Belgrade's main Republic Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police briefly blocked one of three main bridges over the Sava River, trying to prevent people and a column of about 100 taxi drivers from joining the evening protest in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside Belgrade, thousands of high school students shunned classes in Nis, Serbia's third-largest city, and spilled into the streets some jumping out of first-floor classroom windows in their haste to attend the protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> banners, they chanted: &quot;Save Serbia and kill yourself, Slobodan,&quot; while taxi drivers blockaded adjoining streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know why you are not in school today,&quot; Mayor Zoran Zivkovic told the students in Nis. &quot;You refuse to accept injustice!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walkouts joined by shopkeepers and company employees were staged in a dozen other cities and towns, including the opposition strongholds of Cacak and Kragujevac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Valjevo was completely blocked and thousands protested in Kraljevo. In Novi Sad, state television employees stopped work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A main highway in western Serbia was blocked for one hour by about 60 cabbies as a warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Friday, Serbia's opposition lodged an official complaint with the Federal Election Commission, providing its tally showing Kostunica beat Milosevic, 51.34 percent to 36.22 percent, in Sunday's vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the commission fails to respond to the complaint, the opposition plans to press the case in the country's constitutional court. The opposition said it would dispatch delegations to army headquarters, the Interior Ministry and Serbian state television with documents proving its election victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An opposition member of the commission, Nebojsa Bakarac, told reporters Milosevic falsified more than a hundred thousand votes from polling places that never opened in Albanian-populated towns in Kosovo and that there was proof of ballots &quot;cast&quot; by dead voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another critic of Milosevic, Bernard Kouchner, the U.N. administrator of Kosovo, accused the Yugoslav president of manipulating votes cast in that southern Yugoslav province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kouchner said that although the Milosevic camp says 140,000 people voted in Kosovo, the maximum was no more than 45,000 and probably much fewer according to the 300 teams of U.N. observers counting voters Sunday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE first stirrings of revolution in Serbia against President Slobodan Milosevic are raising hopes his brutal reign may be coming to an end. But few expect him to go quietly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Serbian democrats mobilise in the hope of a &quot;velvet&quot; revolution such as saw the peaceful transfer of power from Communist dictatorship to liberal democracy elsewhere in eastern Europe, there is growing concern Milosevic and his fanatical supporters will resist change with force, prompting yet more bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strength and the speed with which grassroots hostility to Milosevic is emerging in Serbia suggest he faces the real prospect of a mass uprising. But his 10-year rule of Yugoslavia has been characterised by a ferocious determination to cling to power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His disastrous military adventures in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo have greatly diminished his standing with his people. But Milosevic has built a formidable security apparatus that most observers believe will stay loyal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Government-run southern Serbian town of Prokuplje on Thursday night, demonstrators cheered as they trampled over scaffolding originally erected as a platform for a cancelled pro-government counter-rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point the local chief of the ruling Socialist Party, Ratko Zecevic, fired into the air from the balcony of the party office as the building was surrounded by 5,000 protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police made no effort to intervene when scuffles broke out between an elderly Socialist Party official and several protesters. Two Milosevic loyalists on a shop roof unveiled a banner insulting opposition leaders just as they climbed their own platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They retreated under a shower of rocks. It was when they were chased back to the party office that the shooting occurred. A knot of 15 Milosevic supporters was jostled after trying to heckle speakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally in Prokuplje, a market town, was the third organised by the Alliance for Change, an umbrella group of 30 parties, who hope to create enough momentum over the northern summer to stage protests in the capital, Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first rally, held last week in Cacak, was disrupted by a bomb believed to have been detonated by Milosevic supporters. No-one was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Tuesday's second rally, in Uzice, electricity to the public address system was cut off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign of rolling protests in southern and central Serbia is attempting to exploit the disaffection of army and police reservists who have not been paid for war service in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state-controlled media have continued to ignore the protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before speaking at Prokuplje, Zoran Djindjic, one of the alliance leaders, travelled to the Gracanica monastery in Kosovo, an area with several Serb villages, to ask the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Pavle, to support the campaign to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">oust Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Djindjic was given a hostile reception by local Serbs, who accused him of abandoning them without food or aid since the Yugoslav army withdrew from Kosovo last month. Some members of the crowd called him a thief who wanted to steal Milosevic's position and shouted at leaders of the Serbian Orthodox church in Kosovo, warning them not to interfere in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbs first attacked reporters and then invaded a news conference that Mr Djindjic and members of the alliance were holding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the city of Leskovac, another former Milosevic stronghold, protesters filled the streets on Thursday night for the fourth consecutive night, calling for Milosevic's resignation and free elections. They also attacked the home of the local party leader, Zivojin Stefanovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western observers see the Leskovac demonstrations as important because they appear to have been the spontaneous action of local people. Most other recent protests were organised by opposition groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spark for the demonstrations in Leskovac was the action of a 31-year-old television technician without any history of political activism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Friday night Ivan Novkovic interrupted the televising of a basketball match to broadcast a recording of himself accusing Mr Stefanovic of abusing his authority, appointing cronies to head local companies and destroying the local economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Novkovic was arrested and sentenced to 30 days' jail, but his action appears to have turned him into a local hero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident created a scramble by opposition parties to try to tap into the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti- Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sentiment in his own political stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this has highlighted the great weakness of the campaign to oust Milosevic and why his position appears to be secure for the time being at least - the Serbian opposition remains divided and leaderless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign observers believe the first real test of whether the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can combine into a serious threat will come when the man regarded as Serbia's most respected political figure returns to Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dragoslav Avramovic, a former governor of the central bank who has played a key role in the creation of the Alliance for Change, is regarded as having the best chance of bringing divided opposition parties together under single leadership. He is due to return next week after receiving medical treatment in Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a newspaper interview he warned that street protests against Milosevic would not lead far without a strategy for replacing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned that because of the war crimes charges Milosevic faces, he would be unlikely to give in to demands for his resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Avramovic said the only way Milosevic might agree to stand aside would be if he were given some guarantee he would not end up before the UN war crimes tribunal in the Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prospects the Western alliance might agree to such a guarantee seem remote. Whether Serbia's opposition leaders would be inclined to offer Milosevic such protection is also doubtful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That leaves him with a very strong motive for retaining power, and using whatever means he has to.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE--More than 150,000 opponents of President Slobodan Milosevic applauded his chief political rival yesterday in a preelection rally where the crowd eclipsed a simultaneous pro-Milosevic gathering by more than 10 to 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of supporters of opposition presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica assembled in front of the parliament building in Belgrade in a boisterous display of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sentiment before presidential and parliamentary elections Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many chanted &quot;He's finished,&quot; or &quot;Save Serbia from this madhouse, Kostunica.&quot; Others displayed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> slogans and jeered loudly at any mention of the president's name.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a great chance and hope that after [Sunday's] elections, we will begin a new life in different Serbia,&quot; Kostunica told the joyful crowd, concluding his speech with: &quot;May God help you to have enough courage . . . to win freedom! For Serbia!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic labeled his opponents &quot;rats and hyenas&quot; while on a campaign stop in Montenegro, the smaller of Yugoslavia's two republics, where pro-Western leaders have urged residents to boycott what it considers an unfair vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Belgrade, the president addressed about 10,000 supporters in a sports hall across the Sava River while Kostunica prepared to speak. Although the size of the hall limited the crowd, the turnout for the candidates' rallies echoed the results of recent polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opinion surveys show Kostunica with a double-digit lead on Milosevic. There are fears, however, that Milosevic would not concede a loss and could try to stay in power by rigging the vote or imposing martial law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW--Following Russian Orthodox tradition, Russians marked the 40th day after the sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk, mourning the deaths of its 118 sailors and officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian officials say most of the Kursk's crew was probably killed instantly when the submarine was shattered by an explosion on Aug. 12. But some of the sailors may have remained alive for hours or even days after the disaster, as the submarine lay on the floor of the Barents Sea, officials have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Memorial services were held across Russia. Priests chanted liturgies in a chapel on the military base of Vidyayevo, out of which the Kursk sailed on its last voyage. And families of the seamen packed churches in the city of Kursk, for which the submarine was named and from which many of the crew came.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measure, approved by the House of Representatives on May 24 in a 237-197 vote, will take effect once China becomes a member of the World Trade Organization, expected within months.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI--A summit aimed at consolidating a fragile peace accord in Burundi ended in the Kenyan capital with no cease-fire accord but an appeal by mediators for all sides to cease hostilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although mediator Nelson Mandela, the former South African president, had persuaded most of Burundi's political parties to sign a peace deal last month, the two main armed Hutu rebel </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were not involved in negotiations until yesterday's meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A communique issued after the meeting--which included the presidents of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania--called for all sides to sign a cease-fire within 30 days.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by Serbian TV on 12 March</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Announcer] Mira Markovic, Marko and Marija Milosevic have still not decided where Slobodan Milosevic is to be buried, although Russia is being mentioned most frequently. Borislav Milosevic, the brother of the former president of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, has told our TV that Slobodan Milosevic must be buried in our country as a great son of Serbia and Montenegro. The Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS] has asked the relevant bodies to allow the funeral to take place in Belgrade, with the family in attendance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Reporter Ivanka Maricic] The spouse of former President Slobodan Milosevic proposed yesterday that the body be transported to Russia so it could be buried there. Although there has been media speculation that Marija Milosevic, the daughter of the late former president, has asked that her father be buried in Montenegro, where she is living now, the Tanjug news agency has said that Marija backs her mother's proposal after all. It is not known what Marko Milosevic thinks about the funeral. Even though the SPS says that it is in contact with him, the public does not know his whereabouts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brother of the late former president, Borislav Milosevic, has told our TV that Slobodan Milosevic must be buried in his own country. The last time he talked to him was on Thursday [9 March], when he did not complain about his treatment in Scheveningen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Borislav Milosevic on the phone, presumably in Moscow] He complained earlier that the headphones they had imposed on him - they took away his own in October - were causing hearing problems, buzzing in the head and vertigo. That is what he complained of earlier, while this poisoning you have mentioned, he did not complain about that to me now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Reporter] Tell me if you know anything about this - [Milosevic's lawyer] Mr Zdenko Tomanovic today presented a letter in The Hague which Slobodan had sent to [Russian Foreign Minister] Mr [Sergey] Lavrov. Did you know about this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Milosevic] I haven't read the letter, but I know about it. I was informed about it by the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation on Friday [10 March]. I found out that it had been handed to the Russian embassy in The Hague. It was handed on Friday. That letter was hand-written. I haven't read it, I have still not received it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Reporter] Are you travelling to The Hague? Who will take over the body? Have you decided anything?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Milosevic] No, I am not going to The Hague. A group of Russian doctors will be going there, headed by Mr Leo Bokeria, director of the Bakulev scientific centre for cardio-vascular surgery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Reporter] Marija and Marko have not seen their father for almost five years, since he was taken to the Hague tribunal's detention unit. The arrest warrant for Marko issued by the court in Pozarevac [Milosevic's home town] was withdrawn in August 2005, following the withdrawal of charges of threatening and maltreating an activist of [the student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] Otpor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time Mira Markovic saw her husband was in October 2003 in The Hague. Since then she has not even been to Serbia. A trial against her opened in April 2005 on the basis of a bill of indictment on mediation in the unlawful allocation of flats from the Serbian government's housing fund. Since she failed to turn up in the courtroom of the Belgrade District Court, an arrest warrant was issued. The arrest warrant was re-issued in September 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SPS has demanded that the state create conditions for both the family and Serbia to part with Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[SPS official Ivica Dacic speaking at presser] We are asking the State of Serbia to act in a dignified manner towards a man who used to be the president of the Republic of Serbia, president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and we are demanding of the people who are today at his post to take this into consideration and enable both his family and those who love and respect Slobodan Milosevic to bid farewell to him in a dignified manner here in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Reporter] The Serbian Radical Party [SRS] has called on Serbian President Boris Tadic to pardon Milosevic's wife, so the former president of Serbia and Yugoslavia could be buried in the Alley of the Great [section of Belgrade's Novo Groblje cemetery in which prominent Yugoslav and Serbian political and cultural figures are buried] in Belgrade. They believe that the charges against Mira Markovic are absurd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[SRS deputy chairman Tomislav Nikolic] If the funeral takes place in Moscow, the party's top leadership will go there. [SRS chairman and Hague indictee] Vojislav Seselj's wife will also be travelling there as the wife of his friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Reporter] Serbian President Boris Tadic's office says that they have not received an official request for Mira Markovic to be pardoned. In case such a request arrives, we have learned unofficially that on the basis of his constitutional authorities the Serbian president will not pardon Mira Markovic. Our law envisages the possibility that detention, as a security measure for attendance of a trial, can be replaced by guaranty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Spokeswoman for the Belgrade Court of Investigation Ivana Ramic on the phone] Guaranty can be provided by the accused himself or someone else in his name, but it is necessary that the accused himself promise that he will not hide, that he will not flee, i.e. that he will not leave his residence without permission before the completion of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Reporter] According to the provisions of our law on the termination of detention, it is necessary that the public prosecutor declare himself as well. If the detention is lifted, the arrest warrant will be withdrawn as well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VOJISLAV KOSTUNICA is one of the gloomiest men I know. This may be an advantage for a new president of whatever remains of Yugoslavia, if that is how he emerges from yesterday's heady scenes of revolution. A &quot;new&quot; Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will have a ruined economy, like Romania after 1989; a burden of guilt, like Germany after 1945; ubiquitous corruption, like Russia today; and unresolved ethnic -territorial issues, like, well, old Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Who is the leader upon whom such a heavy burden may fall? A large, heavy man, grey-suited, quietly spoken, painstakingly analytical, Dr Vojislav Kostunica (pronounced Kosh-TOON-it-sa) talks more like an academic than a politician. Indeed, until 10 years ago, he was just that - a politically engage constitutional lawyer and political scientist. Now 56, he has only been an active party politician since the age of 45, when non-communist party politics became possible in Yugoslavia in 1989.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first time we met, in 1996-97 at the time of the last great </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti- Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations, he took me to an old-fashioned restaurant in central Belgrade and told me that he really believed in Yugoslavia. The original Yugoslavia, that is; the Serb-dominated unitary kingdom between the two world wars (his father was an officer in its royal army). It was, he said, or at least it should have been, an exercise in British-style nation-building under a constitutional monarchy. Look how the king had given his first son a Serb name, his second a Croatian one, and his third a Slovenian - rather as British monarchs deliberately call their heir the Prince of Wales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the other nationalities of former Yugoslavia would find that a very rose-tinted view. But no, he didn't believe in the restoration of the monarchy. Apart from anything else, he said, the pretender to the throne, Crown Prince Alexander, barely spoke Serbian. When they met, they had to talk in English - which Dr Kostunica speaks fluently. Now he believed in the need for &quot;asymmetric federalism&quot;, as a solution for Kosovo, Montenegro and Vojvodina, and perhaps also for the Serb republic in Bosnia. And he explained to me at length about his plans for the &quot; regionalisation&quot; of Yugoslavia. At rather boring length, I must say. Vojislav Kostunica is a very serious man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Solid. Consistent. Knowledgeable and capable of sophisticated rational argument. Principled, too. But hardly a bundle of fun. Short on charisma. Nor is he a great believer in the politics of the street. That time, he told me how he saw unhappy echoes of 1968 in the street demonstrators' cult of spontaneity, their belief in &quot;the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; as an end in itself. This is the man whose future, and with it the future of all south-eastern Europe, now depends on his ability to lead and channel a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of mass protest and civil disobedience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In late 1998, we talked in the office of his tiny party, the Democratic Party of Serbia. His spartan offices seemed virtually empty, as if a removals van was about to arrive. Under the harsh neon light, the talk was all of Kosovo, and how its future inside Serbia must be secured by constitutional, peaceful means. Ordinary, decent Serbians would be dismayed at what Milosevic was doing there, he said. In an election held under international supervision, Milosevic could be defeated. Fat chance, I thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A year later, after the war and the Nato bombing, which he criticised fiercely, the office seemed even more spartan and bare. Other opposition politicians clearly had plenty of money from somewhere - and Belgrade gossip would soon tell you from where - but not Serbia's Dr K. This time, he was furious with the United States, and with Britain. &quot;Blair! Cook!&quot; - he spat out the names with contempt. But, he went on, &quot;I know they are not the West. Fortunately there is also Simon Jenkins (The Times columnist who criticised the Kosovo war), Henry Kissinger (whom he clearly took as another war critic), Noam Chomsky and Harold Pinter!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, as our papers say, a &quot;moderate nationalist&quot;? Well, what exactly is a &quot;moderate nationalist&quot;? Some old Yugoslav hands, shocked by his strong support for the Bosnian and Kosovo Serbs, say he's as bad as Milosevic. Some even say he's more deeply nationalist than the post-communist, opportunist Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is both true and completely false. It's true he's been more seriously and consistently concerned about the fate of the Serbian nation than Milosevic. That is one of the reasons he was purged from Belgrade University in 1974. In other, happier places and times he would be a conservative, romantic patriot, of the kind frequently encountered in the British Conservative party (and they have some pretty rose -tinted views of the national past, too). In this unhappy place and time, he has said and done things he should regret: being photographed holding an automatic weapon among Kosovo Serbs, for example, although he says the weapon was thrust upon him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But I have no doubt that he is genuinely &quot;moderate&quot;, and what matters is his moderation. The difference between him and Milosevic is that between day and night. This is not just because Kostunica is supported by a coalition of less nationalist democrats. It's because he is himself, in his whole style and intellectual formation, profoundly committed to civilised, peaceful, constitutional means. And one lesson of Europe's terrible 20th century is that the means you embrace are quite as important as the ends. Perhaps more important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a man who is passionate about the rule of law. Who believes in elections, institutions, negotiations. He's also a man who, precisely because he is a Serbian patriot - or nationalist, if you will - sees that the only future for his country lies in a return to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether he can become a popular leader of a successful revolution, we shall see. He made a fine beginning at last Wednesday's post-election &quot;victory rally&quot;. Addressing his &quot;dear, brave fellow-citizens, free people&quot;, as they stood waving banners and rattles, he said: &quot;We are fighting for democracy, and democracy is based on truth, not on lies.&quot; One might almost be listening to Vaclav Havel in Wenceslas Square in Prague, 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then Kostunica addressed a skilful message to rank-and-file members of Milosevic's Socialist Party: &quot;we will not act as did your leaders: we will not hound people who have opposing opinions; we will not burst into other people's houses... we will not remove the property of the people from the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the nine days since then he has placed himself, with whatever feelings, firmly and defiantly at the front of a growing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of popular protest. On Tuesday, he observed: &quot;I don't like the word revolution. But what is happening in Serbia today is a revolution - a peaceful, non-violent, wise, civilised, democratic revolution.&quot; On Wednesday, he was again cheered to the echo by striking coal miners at the strategically vital Kolubara mines, which have emerged as an epicentre of this revolution (a comparison can be made with the role of the Gdansk shipyard in the Polish revolution of 1980 - although there it was the workers who started it, and opposition leaders from the capital then joined them, whereas here it is the other way round). &quot;President! President!&quot; the miners shouted. As I write, late on Thursday afternoon, a massive demonstration of popular anger has engulfed Belgrade. Demonstrators have stormed the parliament and are reportedly attacking the state radio and television building. Who knows what will have happened by the time you read this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly, the rapids that Kostunica has to negotiate over the next few days are far more treacherous than those Vaclav Havel faced in 1989. But history makes unlikely heroes, and Serbia's Dr K may yet be one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The author's eyewitness accounts of the revolutions of 1980 and 1989, 'The Polish Revolution: Solidarity and We The People', are both available in Penguin paperback</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BELGRADE: Prominent Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic claimed to have been the victim of an assassination attempt yesterday, after being involved in a car crash in which four of his team died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Draskovic, president of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO), told a television reporter the car crash was an &quot;obvious assassination attempt&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The car in which Mr Draskovic was travelling swerved off the road to avoid hitting a truck.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The car in which Mr Draskovic's security team was travelling hit the lorry head on, one of Mr Draskovic's advisers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are talking about an obvious assassination attempt, and with God's will everybody was killed but myself,&quot; Mr Draskovic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Let those who carried it out reflect well on what will happen to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The assassination attempt claim came as mass demonstrations against the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic took place throughout Serbia for the 13th consecutive day, bringing tens of thousands of people out on the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic was &quot;slightly injured&quot; in the accident, which happened near Lazarevac, 40km south of Belgrade, his party said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Killed in the accident were Mr Draskovic's security chief, Zvonko Osmajlic, two other members of the security team, Dragan Vusurevic and Vusur Rakocevic, and Mr Draskovic's brother-in-law, Veselin Boskovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The truck suddenly, without any reason ... switched to our side of the road and it was clear to me that it had intended to kill me,&quot; Mr Draskovic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Borivoje Borovic, a lawyer and member of the SPO's directorate, said the road was straight, and not slippery, and visibility was good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The truck driver disappeared,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Draskovic aide said the opposition leader's wife, Danica, was also slightly injured but Mr Borovic said she had been travelling in a third car which was not involved in the crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An investigating magistrate said the truck had been driving on the wrong side of the road at the time of the collision, &quot;for reasons yet unknown&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally organised by the opposition coalition Alliance for Change, a minute's silence was held in honour of the killed SPO officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SPO does not participate in the alliance's daily protests aimed a ousting Mr Milosevic, due to a disagreement over strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile the mass protests continued, with police cordons restricting a march by some 15,000 people through the centre of Belgrade yesterday, directing the crowd back to a square where the demonstration had begun. There were no reports of violent incidents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have become simply Vuk and Zoran. One is Serbia's heart, the other its head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every day for almost a month, this odd couple of Serbian politics has marched side by side at the front of Belgrade's pro-democracy demonstrations, looking like socks that got mixed up in the wash - Vuk Draskovic, the wild-maned, aging hippie, and Zoran Djindjic, the clean-cut, Clintonesque pragmatist with the high-voltage smile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic, 44, is a city boy steeped in the rigors of German philosophy; Draskovic, 50, is a shepherd's son raised on heroic Serbian ballads. One is an ivory-tower dissident, the darling of Belgrade intellectuals; the other a peasant nationalist who appeals to Serbs who keep icons and listen to folk music. Their only common link is a visceral dislike of Yugoslavia's communist system.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet for all their political and personal differences, this temperamentally mismatched duo has managed to fuse the disparate forces of the Serbian opposition into a single wedge for democratic change, and to rattle the nine-year-old authoritarian regime of President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have done something everyone thought was impossible,&quot; said Milan Protic, director of the Center for Serbian Studies. &quot;They got people out on the streets and they've done a good job of keeping them there. I think this is the beginning of the end for Mr. Milosevic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the enthusiastic daily street marches alone will succeed in dislodging Milosevic is still anything but certain. Even so, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for change would never have begun if Draskovic and Djindjic - whose name sounds like &quot;ginger&quot; - had not teamed up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the leaders of different opposition parties, the two had been rivals who aspired to be president of Serbia. Then, this fall, in an effort to whittle away at Milosevic's hold on the federal parliament and local councils, they put aside their egos and squabbles to form a broad coalition with three other democratically oriented parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling themselves Zajedno, or Together, this alliance of convenience managed to win council majorities in 14 of 19 large cities. Djindjic was preparing to take over as mayor of Belgrade when Milosevic's courts annulled the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic and Djindjic immediately became the two most charismatic figures in the ensuing protests, even though they represent opposite trends in Serbian politics. They share only a commitment to the democratic rule of law and an intense dislike of Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Draskovic, a bearded author of national epics, who first fired up Serbia's nationalist consciousness in the early '90s with his Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Born amid the rocky mountains of Herzegovina in Bosnia, where thousands of Serbs died at the hands of Croatian fascists in World War II, he gained a huge following by advocating a return to the traditions of Serbian and Orthodox culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whenever he spoke, crowds would chant &quot;Vuk, Vuk, Vuk&quot; - a name that means &quot;wolf&quot; in Serbian. An admiring painter depicted him as Christ blessing his flock. When war again threatened the region, his ecstatic followers formed into paramilitary brigades. But to everyone's surprise, Draskovic renounced the force as a solution to the ethnic conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll never forget when Vuk called me in 1992 and said he wanted to join our antiwar demonstration,&quot; recalled Borka Pavicevic, copresident of the Belgrade Circle, a group of liberal intellectuals. &quot;He lost some supporters when he did that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic's popularity has waned over the last four years, perhaps reflecting a weariness with his passionate emphasis on all things Serbian and his penchant for rhetorical flourishes, a tendency that intellectuals here sometimes deride as &quot;epic-ism.&quot; &quot;I think he's a better man than a politician,&quot; said Pavicevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Draskovic is criticized for his passionate excess, Serbian liberals sometimes complain that Djindjic seems to lack soul. Feminist writer Jasmina Tesanovic noted that while Draskovic was turning out best-selling, historical novels full of &quot;blood, sweat and sperm,&quot; Djindjic was translating obscure philosophical tracts with titles like &quot;Problems of Left Intellectuals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unlike Draskovic, Djindjic's commitment to democracy is unquestioned. As a student at Belgrade University, he defied the Communist authorities by starting a rival student union and publishing a free-thinking student newspaper. At a time when Yugoslav leader Marshal Tito was treated as infallible, Djindjic wrote an article criticizing a plan to build a costly memorial in his home village, recalled Dusan Velickovic, a college buddy of Djindjic's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was very brave,&quot; Velickovic said. Djindjic was arrested and tried for the offense. After receiving a suspended sentence, he decided it was best to continue work on his doctorate in Germany. He was planning to become a philosophy professor there until the Berlin Wall fell, and the same democratic tendencies swept into Yugoslavia. He returned to Yugoslavia in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last few years, Draskovic has evolved into a real democrat, too. He embraces the Dayton peace accords more warmly than any politician in the former Yugoslavia, perhaps more warmly than Djindjic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a shift that shocked his most loyal supporters, Djindjic supported the cause of the Bosnian Serbs in 1994. At a time when NATO was bombing Serb positions to protect Muslim havens, Djindjic journeyed to Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale for a day of skiing and feasting on roasted oxen with Bosnian Serb politicians. Today he opposes attempts to bring war-crimes charges against Radovan Karadzic and other Bosnian leaders; he even backed Karadzic's party in the local Bosnian elections, saying it was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the streets, demonstrators will sometimes say they prefer Djindjic or they prefer Draskovic, but far more often they will say they care for neither very much. &quot;We're not here to support one or the other. We're here to support a principle,&quot; explained Jasminka Petrovic, a lawyer who joined a two-hour-long march through Belgrade this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, however, say they often wish for a candidate who combined Draskovic's moral fervor and Djindjic's organizing skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until someone like that emerges, it's the younger, more urbane Djindjic who is increasingly seen as the right person to help Serbia become a modern, Western-style nation. &quot;Djindjic is really the brains of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; said a liberal Belgrade analyst who asked not to be named. &quot;He has a lot of smart, capable people in his party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However successful the pair becomes, the analyst said, neither man is ready to govern just yet. Beyond their aversion to Milosevic, they have no clear program for reviving Serbia's wounded economy. Nor do they have supporters experienced in running a government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The analyst said they would do better to seek the Serbian presidency next year, after Milosevic's term expires. Although he is constitutionally forbidden to seek a third term, many believe Milosevic will try to change the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best scenario is the one that seems just within the opposition's grasp: taking control of the city councils that the Zajedno won on Nov. 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First,&quot; said the analyst, &quot;Djindjic should learn to be mayor of Belgrade. Then he can run for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were waving flags. They carried balloons. They even carried babies' rattles. They were celebrating the end of the era of Mr Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We beat them like a baby beats its rattle,&quot; people said to each other, shaking the rattles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the stage the announcer gave the names of the local authorities in which the opposition had won: from Nis in the south to Novi Sad in the north, and in the central Serbian heartland of Cacak, Kraljevo and Kragujevac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the name of every city claimed by the opposition and every vote total, a massive cheer rang out from the square. Flares shot into the sky, and the sound of music echoed through the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economist and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activist, Mr Maladjan Dinkic, took the stage. &quot;We've voted for Kostunica and now they have the last chance. They can choose to go easily. If not, only God can help them, because it is time,&quot; he declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was so much jubilation in Belgrade - and in dozens of other cities across Serbia last night - that people said it seemed impossible for the defeated President Milosevic to do anything but step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a massive 75 per cent turnout, the opposition swept to victory in the presidential, local and federal polls, according to opposition figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't have hope before. I didn't think there was a future, even two days ago. Talking about a future was like a fairytale before. Now there is light at the end of the tunnel,&quot; said Ms Milica Rajic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Dr Kostunica took to the stage there was a massive roar. &quot;We have victory. And they have lost,&quot; he declared. &quot;There is no dealing with them. We have support from the European Union. We have support from Russia. But the main thing is our own strength.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next move by the regime will be clear today. But yesterday Belgrade was awash with rumours of collapse at the heart of the regime. Resignations and defections were being reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some senior socialists were said to have left the country. Others have sounded out the opposition about their prospects if they abandon the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A youngster from the student resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor, won a massive roar from the crowd when he declared: &quot;In 1988 we promised resistance until victory and we are here. We said he is finished. And we are here.&quot; The crowd roared back: &quot;Gotov je (he is finished).&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Dec. 22, 1993</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a substantial jump in the number of seats his party controls in parliament, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has proven once again that he is the most resilient ex-Communist leader in Eastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his apparent failure to win a sought-after parliamentary majority in balloting last Sunday will force him to work for the first time with opposition parties not under his direct control. Ivica Dacic, spokesman for Milosevic's Socialist Party, said today that it will talk with other parties about forming a new government, but declined to specify which ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a concession to pluralism is significant, observers said. Since its first multi-party elections in 1990, Serbia has essentially functioned as a one-party state with Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia firmly in control, backed by state-run TV and the biggest police force in Europe. Any cracks in this edifice, diplomats said, would constitute a victory for democracy even if opposition parties at this stage are as nationalistic as the president concerning Serbia's role in the Bosnian war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First they need to introduce debate into the political equation. Once they do that, people will naturally begin to question nationalism,&quot; a Western diplomat said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the necessity of day-to-day cooperation with the opposition could advance the prospects for peace in Bosnia and Croatia, where Serb forces supported by Milosevic have waged two wars and grabbed huge chunks of territory since 1991. By including political foes in decisions, the president will be able to blame them if the results fall short of the Serb dream that all Serbs in what used to be Yugoslavia will live in one state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The important thing to realize is that Milosevic is not a nationalist because he believes in it, he is a nationalist because it has given him power,&quot; said Srjdan Bogosavljevic, former director of the Federal Institute of Statistics. &quot;He will drop nationalism if that means he'll stay in power longer, but to do that he needs someone to blame. That's where the opposition comes in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main question now, diplomats ask, is whether Bosnia's Muslims will view the election results as a setback for Milosevic and prolong the war to pressure him further before they agree to Bosnia's partition. Serbia is tottering under the weight of international sanctions, imposed by the United Nations in 1992 for Milosevic's support of Serb aggression in Bosnia and Croatia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 98.5 percent of the ballots counted, the Central Electoral Commission announced today that of the Serbian parliament's 250 seats, Milosevic's party would win 123, up from 101 in the last parliament, and a party of ethnic Albanians that backs the president would get two. Four opposition parties that ran </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaigns are expected to win 120 seats. A party representing Hungarians from the northern province of Vojvodina won the remaining five. The commission ordered recounts in just 50 of the republic's 9,957 polling stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, leader of the opposition Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called the tally a &quot;great victory,&quot; pointing out that 21 of the Socialists' seats came from the predominantly Albanian province of Kosovo, where more than 1 million Albanians, who want to secede from Serbia, boycotted the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Milosevic in the long term has got some problems,&quot; said Nenad Stefanovic, a political commentator. &quot;Now he's got to work with the opposition, but this is a man who still believes in the one-party state, a man who thinks of a multi-party system as the source of all evil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stefanovic said he did not believe the opposition would be able to put aside the quarrels that kept it from uniting during the campaign and form a government, especially because one of the leading parties is led by ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj, a former Milosevic ally accused of being a war criminal. But Stefanovic also predicted that neither would Milosevic get the &quot;stable parliament, free of obstructions,&quot; that he called for Sunday when he voted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political instability is what we have to look forward to,&quot; Stefanovic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, Milosevic's party will be able to block the passage of an opposition-backed law challenging his control of Serbian state television, a move considered critical for democracy in Serbia. A study of the time the state network devoted to the campaign found it aired more than four hours of pro-Milosevic candidates compared with 4 minutes and 37 seconds for the top opposition group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a republic of 10 million where only 4 percent of the population reads newspapers or magazines, it is hard to overestimate the importance of television to Milosevic's government. More than a mechanism to back his party, television occupies a critical position in communicating his worldview to the Serbian people. It is a worldview that, according to Stefanovic, stresses xenophobia and taps into a sense among Serbs that they are the underdogs of history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stefanovic's independent news magazine, Vreme, was recently described in a state-run TV show as backed by &quot;dark forces.&quot; A recent prime-time news broadcast employed the term &quot;international plots&quot; seven times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Milosevic will be able to kill democratizing legislation, Bogosavljevic said, the president will not be able to force through changes in either the Serbian constitution or that of the two-republic Yugoslav federation that he needs to cement his place in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbian constitution limits a president to two consecutive 5-year terms, and Milosevic is in his second term. To get a third term, he would need a two-thirds vote of the Serbian parliament -- more votes than he will have -- to revise the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidency of Yugoslavia -- Serbia plus Montenegro -- is ceremonial. But if Milosevic decided to become federal president, he could make the office more powerful by revising the federal constitution. But to win a two-thirds vote of the federal parliament, he would have to call new federal elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Yugoslav people have paid a terrible price for his ruthless ambition. But in his labyrinth of Belgrade bunkers, the president, the first sitting head of state to be charged with crimes against humanity, looks secure for a while longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Removing him was never one of our stated objectives,&quot; said a senior western official at the European Union summit in Cologne yesterday as the Finnish president, Martti Ahtisaari, arrived from Belgrade bearing the peace agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic's parents both committed suicide, suggesting to many analysts that he too has a death wish. But his survival instincts are acute and he appears to have averted the prospect of a Nato ground invasion which could have climaxed in his overthrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Milosevic now has his back to the wall. He's just trying to save his skin. But he'll try to portray it as a defeat for Nato, a victory for justice and the United Nations,&quot; said Zoran Ivanovic, a veteran Serb opposition commentator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday's capitulation to peace terms almost entirely dictated by Nato leaves Mr Milosevic enough scope to claim, to his own constituency at least, that he is a Balkan hero who stood up to a criminal bully and survived with dignity. His propaganda outlets and his political party were quick to interpret the surrender as a deal that saves Kosovo for Serbia, recognising that the province remains within Yugoslavia's 'territorial sovereignty&quot; a defeat for Albanian separatist ambitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Time will tell whether that claim is justified. The history of Yugoslavia's dismemberment over the past decade suggests otherwise: that Kosovo will ultimately go the way of Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina lost to the man who is the agent of the old federation's collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mr Milosevic does not operate with a view to the long-term. His 10-year rule is an unbroken record of disaster and defeat, laced nonetheless with sweet tactical victories and the taunting and humiliating of opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are several elements to yesterday's deal which he will seek to exploit to his advantage. In the Yugoslav parliament only the neo-fascist Radicals of Vojislav Seselj abstained or voted against the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most crucially for Mr Milosevic, the proposed Russian contingent of up to 10,000 peacekeepers in Kosovo could serve as a guarantor of his continuation in power and could also be the agents of a de facto partition of Kosovo, though such notions were vehemently refuted by western leaders at the EU summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the president's central concern is to cling to power, the post-war era will throw up three potential challenges to his medium-term prospects the mood in the military, the relationship with the small sister republic of Montenegro, and the capacity of a demoralised and divided opposition, which down the years has been vulnerable to co-option by the regime, to revive with western support and present a credible alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nato spokesmen have been quick to seize on the desertions and the mini -insurrections that have taken place within the Yugoslav military over the past month, but it remains notoriously difficult to gauge the degree to which disaffection among the army top brass could threaten Mr Milosevic's grip on power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His decade in office has been punctuated by regular purges of the army high command and he has never favoured the military, starving it of funding, equipment and prestige in favour of building up his own praetorian guard of special interior ministry troops. In the event of a potential army revolt, the paramilitary loyalist police forces will have a key role to play in shoring him up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The war has exposed the widening differences between Serbia and Montenegro, with Milo Djukanovic, the Montenegrin president, emerging as the cheerleader of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Yugoslavia. Peace could aggravate those differences and feed Montenegrin separatism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Montenegro, too, sits the only Belgrade opposition leader to emerge from the disaster with his credibility intact. Zoran Djindjic, head of the Democratic Party and a former Belgrade mayor, defied the regime's insistence on patriotic unity in the face of 'Nato aggression&quot; and fled to Montenegro to avoid Mr Milosevic's hitmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other potential opposition leaders, such as Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or potentially Mr Seselj of the Radicals, have burnt their boats and Mr Djindjic now looks likely to emerge as the pivotal figure, again supported by the west, in the attempt to find an alternative to Mr Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'It's great that we're going to have peace,' said an opposition Serb analyst. 'But this also means that Milosevic stays. God knows what's going to happen in Belgrade next.' Officials of the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague yesterday insisted that the indictment against Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, could not be used as a bargaining chip to broker a peace deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The indictment cannot be removed, has no statute of limitations and will continue to oblige UN member states to arrest Mr Milosevic if he enters their territory, lawyers said. But there is no mention of it in yesterday's peace deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finnish diplomats in Belgrade reported that one of Mr Milosevic's prime concerns in negotiating to end the Nato offensive was his own status and survival under the indictment, but the word from the tribunal was that no deal was possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Louise Arbour, the chief prosecutor, said in announcing the indictments last week that they could only be rescinded by a vote of the UN security council, the tribunal's parent body. For the council to do so, she said, would undermine the whole legal status of the tribunal. James Landale, a spokesman in The Hague, said yesterday: 'The indictment does not put any legal barrier in the way of negotiating with Mr Milosevic. That is a political decision for the people negotiating a settlement. But arrest warrants have been posted under chapter 7 of the UN Charter and no one is in any position to trade away the authority of the tribunal.&quot; Stephen Bates Comment &amp; Analysis Analysis Price of peace Alex Brummer examines the way the burdens of war and peace in the Balkans are already driving down the wobbly euro 19 Comment End of the war?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soon after news came through of the Belgrade parliament's vote, Serbian artillery close to the border between Kosovo and Albania fired a spectacular barrage that sent up great red plumes of dust around the KLA's positions on Mount Pastrik. The shelling underscored an uncomfortable fact for the guerrillas: that a peace plan which would see them disarmed is gaining ground at a moment when the Serbs appear to be weakened and under severe pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initial reaction from the leaders of Kosovo's Albanian community was one of guarded optimism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Militarily, it's better than Rambouillet, but politically it's weaker, because it does not have a referendum on independence,' said Baton Haxhiu, the chief editor of Koha Ditore, which is operating in exile in Macedonia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'I don't believe the game is over until I see the Serb forces get out of Kosovo and Nato forces come in,' he added. 'Milosevic has violated scores of resolutions before, and he's always ready to lie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The peace plan makes no mention of the war crimes tribunal at The Hague. It was a big mistake of the international community to talk to a criminal. If he actually signed the document, it's a moral humiliation for many families in Kosovo'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blerim Shala, a member of the Kosovo delegation at Rambouillet, said: 'It was much better for Milosevic to accept Nato peacekeepers than have ground troops come in with the risk of Americans losing their lives. Then the pressure would have been on to try him.' Mr Shala saw a contradiction between the international trusteeship which the plan creates and Yugoslavia's continuing sovereignty. 'This is a problem, and there is also no referendum on independence,' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nato's position from the outset has been that the KLA should be disarmed as part of any settlement. Though driven from many of its strongholds within Kosovo, the KLA has grown in size. Nato intelligence sources recently put its strength at 17,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will be difficult for the west to persuade the divided Albanian leadership that President Milosevic can be trusted to adhere to any deal, while at the same time convincing the Serbs that the rebel army has been disbanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Section eight of the peace plan refers to 'demilitarisation of the Kosovo Liberation Army' but sets no timetable. It also calls for an interim political agreement that would secure essential autonomy for Kosovo but respects the 'principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and other states in the region'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Throughout the Kosovo crisis, Nato has attempted to keep at arm's length from the KLA. Many western European politicians view the organisation with suspicion, believing that its weaponry has been purchased with profits from the drug trade and that some of its soldiers may have tortured or murderd Serbian civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But under the Rambouillet agreement - signed in March shortly before Nato launched its bombardment of Yugoslavia and the Serbs began their largest ethnic cleansing campaign - the KLA had already promised to disarm. That acceptance was crucial in isolating Mr Milosevic's regime and indirectly triggering Nato's onslaught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The guerrillas have now acquired a substantial presence in north-eastern Albania, perhaps the most poorly communicated and lawless region of Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It offers the KLA a stronghold from which it could hold out against the peacemakers' demands should its leaders choose to do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgrade, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democracy is about choice, but in the Yugoslav version, which is now playing itself out with Slobodan Milosevic's future at stake, there are likely to be more choices than usual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic, Yugoslavia's president, changed the constitution to make his office subject to direct election, and he has now called a vote nine months earlier than he had to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So on Sept. 24, Yugoslavs will vote for a federal president, parliament and municipal officials in an election that will appear like most others, with voters getting to choose between the incumbent and his party, and an array of challengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as election day approaches, a strong opposition candidate is doing better than Milosevic in the opinion polls, and this points up the uniqueness of Yugoslavia's system. Milosevic also gets to make a choice: whether to accept the choice of the people if it goes against him, or to manipulate the totals and declare victory regardless.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then the people will have another chance to choose, but not in the voting booths: will they accept Milosevic's choice, or will they come out onto the streets to defend their own choices, possibly against the arrayed power of the police and even the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a political netherworld, in which the forms and substance of both democracy and authoritarianism are clearly visible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an instructive way, they live side by side here, and both have their limits, depending on the stakes. But with Milosevic's own hat in the ring in a system he has manipulated like a master for 12 years, the real hopes of long-divided opposition leaders are coming up hard against the cynicism of those same challengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a kind of authoritarianism that needs a form of democratic legitimation from time to time,&quot; said Vojislav Zanetic, a marketing consultant, playwright and columnist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a pseudo-democracy, in which the opposition is complicit,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a kind of society that must fall apart slowly -- it can't be ripped apart in one day, in one election. We don't have a political crisis here or even an economic one -- we have a systemic crisis, a crisis of society and political will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a form of parallel political universe. There is a campaign, with speeches and tours and open meetings. There are billboards and opinion polls and marketing experts. There are monitors ready to examine the voting and counting procedures, and Web sites devoted to the election and the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even though the state media, especially television, are thoroughly and aggressively in the hands of Milosevic, there is a lively independent press, including local television and radio, that is both outspoken and combative in the face of government pressure and derision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In general it has lined up dutifully in support of Milosevic's main rival, Vojislav Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet among these opponents there is also a resigned conviction that Milosevic will steal as many votes as he needs to ensure not only victory, but victory in the first round -- since he needs an unquestionable victory to achieve his aims of re-legitimation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that adds a new quality of edge and risk to the options facing Milosevic. &quot;For Milosevic, this election has turned into Russian roulette,&quot; one opposition leader said. &quot;But for him to allow a second round would be suicide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can't Win Against Milo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what of the people of Serbia; wouldn't they come out into the streets to defend the opposition or their own choice? Among the opposition, there are deep concerns that the Serbs, atomized and impoverished, will not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Frankly I'm not so optimistic,&quot; said Vuk Draskovic, the head of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who is living in Montenegro after two attacks on his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of us together are fighting a battle we cannot win. I'm quite sure Milosevic has right now in his pocket the result of the elections. What will happen after 24 September, when the opposition people face the crackdown on their hopes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Kostunica says that &quot;people are fatalistic about the way they see these elections.&quot; Many of his own supporters in the polls, he said, &quot;believe that Milosevic will win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica plans to declare victory the night of the election, as his aides presume Milosevic will. In the case of massive election fraud, he hopes people will come out into the streets the way they did for months after Milosevic refused to acknowledge opposition victories in the 1996 local elections. But even Kostunica is not sure that they will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natasa Kandic, director of the Humanitarian Law Foundation here and a critic of Milosevic and Serb actions in Kosovo, said that Milosevic won't freely cede power even if everyone voted against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What will happen, I don't know,&quot; she said. &quot;It is, however, important that we do not sit at home on Sept. 24, but go outside and defend our votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kandic is facing troubles of her own, with the Yugoslav army threatening to bring her to court over articles she wrote criticizing the behaviour of Serbian forces in Kosovo. These threats to her are part of a skilful effort by the government to intimidate opposition leaders and their supporters, including the student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor, or Resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message that the opposition hears is that the government will react with force, if necessary, against any revolution in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are, in addition, mysterious events that create a chill, like the kidnapping two weeks ago of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic, who was Milosevic's mentor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a swift party coup, Milosevic ousted him in 1987. Although there have been rumours -- which his wife denies -- that Stambolic was considering a run for the presidency, Milosevic and the government forcefully deny any role in the disappearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zanetic, the marketing expert, thinks the government is better than the opposition at propaganda and political marketing, understanding that most Serbs get their information from television. &quot;In politics here, it doesn't matter if you tell the truth or lie -- you must be clear,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is why, if Milosevic claims victory, he is likely to also declare a landslide. And then one may better see where the new balance lies between democracy and authoritarianism.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IF YOU READ ONE THING THIS WEEK. . . <BR> Fear Itself, by Andrew Rosenheim (Hutchinson) R185<BR> AN ELEGANT thriller which focuses on an almost forgotten aspect of the Second World War: the pressure within the US to stay out of the conflict. Stephen Nessheim, a young agent in the fledgling FBI, is assigned to infiltrate the Bund, a group of expat Germans in America with pro-Nazi leanings, and to determine the extent of their influence over the Roosevelt administration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's all pacy stuff, with an ear for the politics and intrigue of the era - and it will remind older local readers of the Ossewa Brandwag.<BR> THE ISSUE<BR> Advance notices for correspondent Kim Barker's The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan (Doubleday Books) have been on the enthusiastic side. <BR> According to one critic, the book &quot;is Scoop meets Dispatches remixed with a 21st century Bollywood soundtrack&quot;. Another praised her for her &quot;dark, self-deprecating humour&quot;. Yet another advised: &quot;Think PJ O'Rourke meets Paul Theroux.&quot; And even O'Rourke noted that Barker &quot;breaks the journo code of silence and reveals a trade secret of the hacks who cover hellholes: The hell of the holes is that they're kind of fun.&quot; Which, of course, is the sort of thing the increasingly obnoxious O'Rourke would say about war.<BR> But hopefully Barker's message - that Washington doesn't have a clue what's happening in the region - won't be lost in all the chuckles.<BR> CRASH COURSE<BR> There's a local aspect to Pulitzer and National Book Award winner Tina Rosenberg's new book, Join the Club: How Peer Pressure Can Transform the World (WW Norton &amp; Co). <BR> Basically, Rosenberg reiterates that we're such creatures of habit that often nothing will sway us from self-destructive behaviour. Crappy public health campaigns, for example, simply don't work. Think of any number of &quot;official&quot; initiatives to curb teen smoking, drug usage, alcoholism, and so on. Why do they fail? Peer pressure.<BR> But Rosenberg cites a case where peer pressure did work - the Aids awareness LoveLife campaign which, she reveals, was modelled on a marketing strategy to relaunch Sprite in the townships. What worked for the fizzy drink worked for LoveLife, and it became one of the country's top brands; it was hip and it saved lives.<BR> Rosenberg's other examples include Serbia's student-led </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indian rural health-worker initiatives, and how a youth programme for young British Muslims could be used in the war against terror. <BR> In a sense, it's a guide to the use of peer pressure against the sort of peer pressure that bothered your mother so much.<BR> THE BOTTOM LINE<BR> &quot;Hast seen the yellow duck?&quot; - Moby-Duck: The True Story of 28 800 Bath Toys Lost at Sea and of the Beachcombers, Oceanographers, Environmentalists, and Fools, Including the Author, Who Went in Search of Them, by Donovan Hohn (Viking)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The wife of toppled Yugoslav president Mr Slobodan Milosevic has branded the Hague tribunal the &quot;gestapo&quot; of the 20th century and blamed British Foreign Secretary Mr Robin Cook for an alleged NATO attempt to kill her daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a rare press appearance, Mrs Mirijana Markovic, the head of the Yugoslav Left party, which shared power with Milosevic's Socialists until the October uprising, said: &quot;The Hague tribunal is the concentration camp and gas chamber of the 20th century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she blamed herself for endangering her children with an open letter to British Foreign secretary Robin Cook after he alleged that they were out of the country during Nato bombing. Days after she had written that they were in Yugoslavia, a NATO missile struck the television station in Belgrade where her daughter Marija had been working.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Markovic's rare appearance was a bid to rally support for her party, which has virtually disintegrated in the last two months, before crucial elections in Serbia next Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a rambling interview lasting more than 90 minutes, she said the left coalition of the former regime had &quot;won the elections, but lost power&quot; in the federal poll because the Montenegrin socialists had defected to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she said she was optimistic about the future of left-wing forces. Asked about money and property that the family had allegedly hidden away, she said. &quot;My family didn't get rich at all. In general we are a family that doesn't have a feeling for material values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her appearance followed a few days after the first television interview by Mr Milosevic, who was re-elected president of the Socialists at a November party conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple's public interviews come as the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition, which won a landslide victory in September's election, continued to show massive leads in all opinion polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Strategic Marketing group estimated that DOS will gain three-quarters of the seats in the new Serbian parliament. It is in fact so certain of victory that it has announced that Mr Zoran Djindjic, head of the Democratic Party, will be prime minister and he has already named his cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The key issue in these elections is ending the era of Milosevic,&quot; said Mr Miljenko Dereta of the non-government group Civic Initiatives. The new republic government will replace a temporary one formed after the October uprising in which each ministry has three ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Milosevic meanwhile is growing increasingly isolated and power is seeping from him. The Socialist party has fractured dramatically, with two rival groups already set up headed by former party officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across Belgrade, posters of the youth resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor cover billboards. The slogan is &quot;Overi&quot; which means &quot;finish the job&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weary of Slobodan Milosevic's iron-handed reign and legacy of Balkan wars, Serbs eagerly embraced Vojislav Kostunica as the man who could topple their autocratic ruler and lead them out of economic hardship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica fulfilled only the first of those desires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tumultuous two years later, Kostunica seeks re-election today by a Serbian electorate disillusioned with the slowness of reforms and the lack of improvement in daily life.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica's own political career is at stake: His job as the federal president could end with constitutional changes intended to transform Yugoslavia into a loose union of its two republics, Serbia and Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So 58-year-old Kostunica decided to run in Serbia's presidential race, boosted by popularity polls that show him in the lead. He is counting on his calm, commonsensical demeanor to keep him on top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His past and his own brand of modest Serb nationalism may do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A somewhat colorless law school professor, Kostunica is a scholar of democracy who translated the Federalist Papers into Serbo-Croat. For his staunch anti-communism, he was kicked out of his job at Belgrade's university in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica found a niche at the Institute of Philosophy, where with time he became merely another academic critic of Milosevic. Then he turned to politics and in 1992 founded the Democratic Party of Serbia, which he has led ever since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2000, the party joined an 18-member </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alliance that launched an election campaign which electrified Serbia and, despite Milosevic's manipulations, won the election of Sept. 24, 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Married without children, Kostunica was known as a frugal, retiring man, and this added to his appeal, setting him in sharp contrast to Milosevic's aloof and authoritarian style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Milosevic out of power and under virtual house arrest, Kostunica settled into the role of Yugoslavia's president and Serbian nationalist who never quite forgave Western leaders for bombing Serbia. He steadfastly refused to extradite Milosevic to the U.N. tribunal at The Hague, Netherlands, on charges of war crimes and genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That resistance led him to a head-on collision with Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, his chief political rival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disregarding Kostunica's argument that delivering a Yugoslav national to The Hague court would be illegal, Djindjic engineered Milosevic's handover in June 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That extradition marked a significant change in the once united pro-democracy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and personal rivalries escalated. Now, Kostunica and Djindjic say they are no longer on speaking terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In today' elections, Serbia's ruling coalition and Djindjic are supporting another candidate, Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labu, and promising &quot;sweeping and fast changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some are in a great hurry,&quot; Kostunica said to a cheering campaign rally last week. &quot;&quot;You and I, meanwhile, know the best things come out of patience and hard work.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">The game is up for a strongman now revealed as the real separatist: Serbia's President is paying dearly for his fit of pique</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By IAN TRAYNOR in Belgrade</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">816 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT WAS, said the Western envoy, like the spoilt child who upends the draughts board halfway through the game because he is losing and cries: 'I'm not playing any more.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, in a fit of pique after having been defeated in a democratic vote, not once but three times in four days, President Slobodan Milosevic withdrew Serbia from Yugoslavia's collective federal presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The game is up in more ways than this. Mr Milosevic's decision to quit punctured two myths he was fond of fostering. Firstly, that it was he and his Serbian Socialist Party that sought to maintain the existence of Yugoslavia, while his rivals outside Serbia were intent on breaking up the union.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'He's losing power in the federal institutions and in Serbia itself. As a result, it turns out that it is Milosevic who is the true separatist,' said one Croatian politician yesterday. That much was long suspected, but has come into sharp focus over the past week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is bad for Mr Milosevic is good for Yugoslavia. Certainly, as a result of the Serbian leader's weakening at the hands of the opposition, Yugoslavia is quietly and coolly fighting back. The army has stuck by the law of the land, abiding by the presidency decision to reject a military clampdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'If the army were to intervene now, I don't see how it could be anything but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' said a Western diplomat. 'He has shown clearly that it is he who is against the federation, the thing that the army is indoctrinated to protect.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Mr Milosevic could count on the support of the top brass he would not have needed to try to wreck the presidency, nor would he proclaim the need to beef up Serbia's own security forces as being so 'urgent'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ante Markovic, the federal Prime Minister, sidelined for months by the ethnic conflicts and subversion by the republics of his economic reforms, is sounding almost serenely confident and unflustered, issuing timely signals stressing that the federal government and federal Parliament will work as normal towards democratic and peaceful solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yugoslavia has entered its final agony, stated Mr Milosevic in his opening sentence on Saturday. Yesterday, the Markovic camp responded crisply that it is Mr Milosevic himself who is in the final throes of agony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Croats said that Mr Markovic's position had been immensely strengthened by the latest eruption of the crisis, while the Serbian leader's weakening was promising for the rest of Yugoslavia. Promising it may be, but it is also dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic is now boxed into a corner. As he sees his power and appeal diminishing, he appears desperate and insecure. Many believe he will flinch from little to remain in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main Serbian opposition party, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> responded immediately to Saturday's declaration by stating it would not be an accomplice to the fanning of 'hatred, chaos, and paranoia' aimed at keeping Mr Milosevic in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But already Mr Milosevic is resorting to the same tactics that brought him to power, seeking to rally the masses to the nationalist flag and exploit Serbian hostility towards the Albanian majority in the southern province of Kosovo, which is under Serbian police rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many expect he will try to provoke disturbances in Kosovo, or in the Sanjak area around the town of Novi Pazar, also in southern Serbia, where there is friction with the Muslim community. Trouble here could quickly spill over into neighbouring Bosnia, the scene of some of the worst atrocities of the civil war in the forties, and nowadays arguably the most ethnically confused and complex area in Europe, where the majority Muslims cohabit increasingly uneasily with large Serb and Croatian minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other myth that has been exploded over the past week by students on the streets of Belgrade is that Mr Milosevic represents all of Yugoslavia's nine million Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That claim was the basis for his intransigence in the stalemated negotiations among the six republics on the future of Yugoslavia. Mr Milosevic has never evinced any readiness or ability to negotiate. But with his sweeping presidential majority from last year, he could claim a mandate for that stubborness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deprived of that mandate by the growing opposition within Serbia, he has simply, by withdrawing Serbia from the presidency, foreclosed the forum for negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much now hangs on what showing the Serbian opposition can muster at the demonstrations it has called for Wednesday, provided the peace is maintained in the meantime. If the opposition mushrooms, it could bring to the fore another Serbia that is flexibly and pragmatically for another Yugo-slavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scenarios among the pundits here are at least as myriad as the nationalities in this country. But amid all the predictions of doom and bloodshed, there is a glimmer of light for the voices of sweet reason.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FROM the thousands of people gathered in central Belgrade on election night came cheers when the Opposition claimed gains and sharp whistles for results in favour of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cheers far outnumbered the whistles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As soon as polling closed across Serbia and Montenegro yesterday, Opposition supporters filed into central Belgrade with an exuberance reflecting their hopes that, this time, Mr Milosevic would not escape the judgment from the streets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After midnight local time, there were 20,000 Opposition supporters filling the city's main axis, Terazije Avenue, letting off firecrackers and throwing cries of &quot;victory&quot; to the night sky in a party atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somewhere, a chant would gather force, calling for Vojislav Kostunica, the Opposition candidate who was allegedly on the verge of trouncing Mr Milosevic in the polls. &quot;Free this country from the asylum it is locked in!&quot; some yelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A moment of tension arrived when about 100 riot police were deployed to step between the burgeoning crowd and a few hundred pro-Milosevic demonstrators who had resolutely taken over the central place, Republic Square, with a state-sponsored concert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Go home. He [Milosevic] is finished,&quot; the opposition supporters cried, drowning out the singers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Go to Kosovo!&quot; they yelled to the police, who were standing impassive in their armour, their batons in hand and their pistols holstered on their belts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minutes ticked by, and the cafes around the square started to take in their tables and chairs, fearing the worst. Then, shortly after midnight, the police and Mr Milosevic's supporters retreated, leaving the centre of Yugoslavia's capital to the massing, happy crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mood was celebratory, fuelled by a regular update yelled from the window of the opposition Democratic Party building on the avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Kill yourself and save Serbia, Slobodan!&quot; was the chant, followed by a vocal demand for their new hero, Mr Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- the largest single opposition party in Serbia -- was awaiting the results in his summer villa at Budva in Montenegro, which, along with Serbia, forms the rump Yugoslav federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;After tomorrow, nothing will be the same in Serbia again,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is unable to return to Belgrade after an assassination attempt on June 15.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hearst Newspapers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE decision by church leaders and several army chiefs to distance themselves from Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic reflects the fact that opposition to him is spurred as much by extreme nationalism as by a desire for democracy, analysts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Serbian Orthodox Church and the military chiefs of the former Yugoslav army strongly supported Mr. Milosevic when he launched the 1992 war to carve out a Greater Serbia from the territory of newly independent Bosnia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, according to historian Georges Castellan, a specialist on the region, church and army leaders blame Mr. Milosevic for selling out Bosnia's Serbs by agreeing to the 1995 Dayton peace agreement under pressure from the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church and the army &quot;have withdrawn their support from Milosevic, not because he thwarted democratic elections in Serbia but because he proved ineffective in advancing Serbia's nationalist ambitions,&quot; Mr. Castellan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For many years, the Orthodox Church and the military were staunch pillars of his autocratic rule. They've dropped him because he failed to create an enlarged Serbian state, not because they're in favour of democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church and the army waited for the regime to become vulnerable and, when it did, jumped in to weaken it further, Mr. Castellan added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the past six weeks, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrators have protested daily in the streets of Belgrade against the government's decision to annul municipal elections after a victory by opposition candidates in 14 of Serbia's 19 largest cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The struggle has been largely portrayed as a straight duel between pro-democracy forces in Serbia and Mr. Milosevic's neo-Communist regime. But some experts question whether it is as simple as that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bernard Orban, a specialist in the politics of the former Yugoslavia at France's National Research Council, said several opposition leaders have long-standing credentials as extreme nationalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Vuk Draskovic [a key leader of the Belgrade protest] may proclaim his conversion to democracy,&quot; Mr. Orban said. &quot;But during the Bosnian war, he adopted an ultranationalist position. He blamed Milosevic for not doing enough to destroy Bosnian independence. Even now, his speeches are filled with allusions to the inevitability of a Greater Serbia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Mr. Milosevic were ousted and Mr. Draskovic took power, it would mean &quot;another war of Serbian expansionism sooner or later,&quot; Mr. Orban said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He conceded the presence of genuine democrats among the organizers of the protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but emphasized that &quot;they are not calling the shots. The nationalists are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its denunciation of Mr. Milosevic last week, the synod, or senior council, of the Serbian Orthodox Church accused him of &quot;ignoring the will of the electorate&quot; by cancelling the election results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But most of the statement issued by the church's 33 bishops was devoted to a denunciation of the Serbian president for &quot;trampling under foot our glorious and sad history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church leaders accused Mr. Milosevic &quot;above all&quot; of &quot;betraying the lands of western Serbia&quot; -- a reference to the loss of the territories of Krajina and Slavonia to Croatian troops late in the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nationalist critics alleged that Mr. Milosevic stood aside and allowed these areas, seized by the Bosnian Serbs earlier, to be reoccupied by the Croats because he was already secretly contemplating a compromise peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The episode also provoked bitterness among military chiefs who have now let it be known they will not order their troops to defend the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The religious leaders, according to Serbian-born political analyst Henry Bernic, &quot;had been prepared to accept almost anything from the Milosevic regime -- even its refusal to return church property confiscated by the Communists -- as long as it championed Serbian nationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Throughout Serbia's history, the Orthodox Church has been a bastion -- often, the most extreme bastion -- of Serbian political ambitions,&quot; he said. &quot;Nothing has changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, Mr. Bernic added: &quot;The rest of the world would be wise to take much of what is occurring now in Serbia with considerable skepticism.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The snapshots of this nation are sobering: long lines for sugar and cooking oil, cash machines that dispense no cash, buses brittle from rust, a burned Parliament, a string of looted banks and the world's perception that Yugoslavs are imbued with a dangerous nationalism that still threatens the Balkans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the larger picture emerging after the defeat of former President Slobodan Milosevic is one of Yugoslavia purging its demons and moving toward reclaiming its place in Europe. There is joy. There is sometimes bewilderment. And there is the belief that the weird and bloody nightmare is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think people abroad now think we're a miracle,&quot; said Dragoljub Milinovic, a veterinary student at Belgrade University. &quot;For 10 years we've lived the level of African nations. Now our optimism is greater than ever. We lived in a state of complete lies. Milosevic lied to us that we were living nicely. He was fooling us even when we knew the truth.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If new president Vojislav Kostunica &quot;manages to introduce real democracy here, then the image of us will change,&quot; said Biljana Radivojevic, a university biology student, who'd like to see the 400,000 young and educated people who fled Yugoslavia during Milosevic's regime to return. &quot;We'll be open to other countries. Young people will be able to travel and show a different face of Serbia abroad. I hope we have that chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task of resurrecting this country of 10 million is enormous. Kostunica is faced with a ruined economy, political mischief from the last of Milosevic's cronies, an independence-minded republic of Montenegro and a troubled province of Kosovo, where 35,000 NATO troops still prevent Yugoslavia from exerting its rule over 1.8 million ethnic Albanians and the province's rich natural resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica is intent on guiding his country back into the fold of the international community. He must balance between Serb suspicion of the West -- especially after last year's NATO bombing -- and the need to open Yugoslavia to world markets. Western diplomats say Kostunica must delicately mend a decade of acrimony and war between Yugoslavia's immediate neighbors -- Bosnia and Croatia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fate of Milosevic is a pressing international concern as the West insists that the former leader be turned over to The Hague for war crimes indictments. Most Serbs believe Milosevic should be tried in Yugoslav courts, not for mass killings and atrocities, but for wrecking what was once one ofeastern Europe's richest nations. Serbs express no desire to use Milosevic's downfall to examine this nation's complicity in four nationalist wars that killed 300,000 people, mostly civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica told western diplomats that there is a &quot;very real possibility Milosevic will be brought before a Serb court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The common people are opposed to the West and the Hague,&quot; said Boijan Djuric, a law student and member of the Belgrade's student resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But Milosevic should be tried for all those war crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo. We are so embarrassed that that's the only way we can change&quot; how the world thinks of Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re-writing the nationalist distortions in Yugoslav history books -- although talked about in this fledgling age of promise -- is expected to take some time. The Serbian spin on the Kosovo war, for example, emphasized &quot;NATO aggression&quot; but never mentioned the ethnic-cleansing and massacres sanctioned by the Milosevic regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Kostunica acknowledged on CBS's &quot;60 Minutes II,&quot; that crimes had occurred during Milosevic's crackdown in Kosovo. It was the first time any Yugoslav leader accepted responsibility and expressed regret for any of the conflicts in the last decade in the Balkans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kosovo is expected to remain a NATO protectorate until Kostunica and ethnic Albanian leaders can negotiate autonomy or other solutions for the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This society is not based on forgiveness. It's based on revenge,&quot; said Maria Babic, who runs youth camps to teach tolerance between different ethnic groups. &quot;Forgiving in South Africa (over apartheid) was seen as a virtue, but here it's a weakness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events of October have stunned this country. Milosevic's downfall -- as 200,000 protesters massed in the streets and armed citizens seized government offices -- thrilled Serbs whose political opposition had been repeatedly crushed by the autocratic leader. Although the uprising appeared spontaneous, much of it was planned, especially the actions of gangs of armed men from the heartland town of Cacak, who rolled into Belgrade with a bulldozer, two truck loads of stones and a van filled with Molotov cocktails. With help from sympathetic police, they captured the Parliament and state TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic fled to his house in the suburbs, where he remains protected by guards. Western officials described Milosevic's regime as &quot;decaying.&quot; The powerful state security police appear to have abandoned him, as have members of his socialist party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The euphoria over the &quot;revolution&quot; vibrates daily across this country. The most popular CD features Milosevic on the cover and the satirical song, The Last Train for Serbia. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> buttons are sold in the streets. The police are nearly invisible. Each day the tiny flags of other countries flap from BMWs and Mercedes as diplomats return to this capital. They bring good news, such as the announcement that the French automaker Peugeot will enter a partnership with Yugoslavia's Zastava car factory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these scenes are inter-cut with images of sugar lines, poverty and the crumpled buildings struck 20 months ago by NATO war planes. Yugoslavia's unemployment rate is 50 percent. The average monthly income is about $40. Pension checks are months late. The elderly routinely pick through dumpsters. Stories of government corruption are endless, such as the looting of $500,000 from the Bim Slavia meat plant by general manager Velibor Tomasevic, a buddy of Milosevic's wife, Mira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At many businesses, workers have forcefully removed their bosses and seized company records. The executives are resorting to some serious last-minute house cleaning. &quot;The management is trying to destroy documents, archives and all traces of their corruption,&quot; said retired Gen. Vuk Obradovic, a leader of a democratic political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sting of the regime's criminality will be felt in coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I expect a lot of problems (in rebuilding the country) but the best of this is there is no more Milosevic,&quot; said Srboljub Antic, a member of G-17, a group of economists advising Kostunica's government. &quot;We don't want to lie to the people . . . We are going to start a campaign soon to warn people of energy shortages over the winter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The biggest issue here is the economy,&quot; said Babic. &quot;Whatever else the new government does won't matter unless people feel it in their wallets . . . They can't wipe out the black market because too many people rely on it now.&quot; The black market, which blossomed under economic sanctions, accounts for atleast 40 percent of the $13 billion gross domestic product, according to independent economists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days the bootleg CD sellers on Resavska Street are not a happy lot. Kostunica's government is attempting to stabilize the dinar. That has them in fits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody knows the real rate of currency,&quot; said Marijan Stojkovic, leaning on a stack of black market CDs imported from Bulgaria. &quot;Nobody is buying. There are no dinars on the streets. We just need a stabilized rate. I bought these CDs at 35 dinars to one German mark. Now the dinar is down to 22 and I'm losing money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union recently pledged $2 billion in aid. International sanctions, including oil and flight embargoes by the U.S., are being lifted. Italian and Greek firms -- who signed letters of intent during sanctions -- are planning to open businesses and offices across Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But political analysts here say that Kostunica's relationship with the West will be risky. If Kostunica, a nationalist himself, appears to anger the Army or to drift too close to the West, diplomats say, it could incite Serb nationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new government is &quot;carefully choosing its words about relationships with western countries,&quot; said Srdan Hofman, a composer and member of the Social Democrats, one of 18 parties supporting Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in his weakened state Milosevic still casts a large shadow on this nation. His fate is ceaselessly debated. Anger over his regime grows. The turmoil he has caused for the last 13 years has set a harsh frame for the future. And, according to Kostunica's reformers, the fallen leader still has supporters who can stir trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vesna Hadjivokovac said the events of the last two weeks have made her numb. She is the epitome of the new Serb state of mind. She was an army spokeswoman during the Kosovo war. Today, she is a translator and analyst for the western media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My suffering is greater than yours,&quot; she recently told a colleague. &quot;I have to explain a logic that doesn't exist.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obituary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoran Djindjic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prime Minister, Republic of Serbia. Born August 1, 1952. Died Belgrade, March 12, aged 50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE assassination of Zoran Djindjic threatens to plunge Serbia and the Balkans back into the appalling turmoil of the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although he was a controversial figure, Djindjic was widely recognised as his country's most dynamic politician. His death leaves no obvious successor at a time of great uncertainty and there are fears that the power vacuum in Serbia could undermine political stability elsewhere, especially in Kosovo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arrogant and effective in equal measure, Djindjic also specialised in making enemies. His greatest opponents were among organised crime syndicates. For years he was accused of collaborating with the Surcin gang, one of the most powerful in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic always denied any association, but when the head of the Surcin gang recently fled the country and began to issue declarations from hiding, observers were alerted that various mafia groups had started to settle old scores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since becoming the Prime Minister of Serbia a little more than two years ago, Djindjic had been steadily introducing painful reforms that have won the plaudits of the European Union and the World Bank, but have not always endeared him to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic never shook off the image of the gangster turned politician -- in contrast to his ally turned nemesis, Vojislav Kostunica, the former Yugoslav president. But three months ago Djindjic signalled that it was time to take on the gangs that plague Serbia. In the past month Serbian police have achieved some of their biggest successes in the fight against organised crime in the Balkans. Several factories producing drugs such as ecstasy for sale in western Europe were closed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic's death has implications that go beyond the struggle against organised crime. In recent months his Government had come under exceptional pressure from the US to hand over to the UN all remaining war crimes suspects thought to be on Serbian territory. In particular, Washington threatened to withdraw its aid program if it did not hand over by the end of June Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb commander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without Djindjic there is almost no chance that Belgrade will meet the deadline and so vital funds could be withheld just when the Serbian economy is desperate for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His murder does not affect the stability of Serbia alone; in the wider region it casts a long shadow over the unresolved issue of Kosovo's status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic had made his name in the West as &quot;the West's man&quot; in post-Milosevic Yugoslavia. In many ways he resembled contemporaries such as Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schroder, in that he seemed to be above all else a pragmatist who had no great visions but was prepared, like Bismarck, to float and steer upon the river of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it was not always so and his political outlook evolved with the great changes that affected his country. To his supporters this was sensible and productive realism; to his opponents it was opportunism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic was born in the Bosnian village of Bosanski Samac in 1952, the son of a Yugoslav army officer. He showed early political awareness when he tried to collect signatures protesting against a new law that made Marshal Tito president of Yugoslavia for life. Although punished for this indiscretion, he went on to complete a philosophy degree at Belgrade University, only to run foul of the authorities once again when, in 1974, with like-minded students from Croatia and Slovenia, he tried to found a non-communist student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For this he and his would-be colleagues were sentenced to one year's jail. On his release, Djindjic went to Germany to study at the University of Frankfurt when that institution was still associated with the student protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Back in Yugoslavia, Djindjic taught philosophy in the universities of Novi Sad and Belgrade. But within a few years he was fully engaged in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the final vestiges of the communist monopoly of power disappeared, Djindjic became one of the founders of the Democratic Party and two years later, in 1990, he became its chairman and in 1994 its president. He was elected to the Serbian parliament in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic then moved his supposedly centrist party closer to Serbian nationalism. In 1994, when the Bosnian Serbs were ordered by the Western powers to end the bombardment of Sarajevo, Djindjic showed, as he said, &quot;solidarity with the Bosnian Serbs&quot; by going to the Bosnian Serb capital, Pale, and partaking of a roasted ox with Radovan Karadzic. Djindjic also had occasional meetings with the notorious &quot;Arkan&quot;, who led one of the groups of irregulars fighting in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet when Serbian nationalism was defeated in 1995, Djindjic sought a new tack, one that brought him into direct opposition to president Slobodan Milosevic. He played a key role in bringing about Zajedno (Together), an alliance of three </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parties. At the end of 1996 the alliance secured notable victories in local elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though Milosevic initially tried to discount the elections, his hand was forced by widespread public protests and Western pressure, and in February 1997 Djindjic became the first non-communist mayor of Belgrade since 1945.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic performed another about-face and abandoned the more vociferous nationalists. In December 1996 he had told the German magazine Der Spiegel that he was &quot;the horse that the West should back&quot;. After his removal from Belgrade Town Hall, he concentrated on gathering round him experts who could help reconstruct a Serbian economy battered by years of war and sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only in the West, he argued, could the requisite expertise and capital be found. This did not mean that he condoned NATO action against Serbia in 1999, but once that had ended he pushed hard for Serbia's reintegration into the West. He became an even more determined opponent of Milosevic and played a significant role in his removal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of 2000 Djindjic was at the head of a new coalition, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, which secured an easy victory in the parliamentary elections. He assumed office as Prime Minister of Serbia in January 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Prime Minister, Djindjic continued his pro-Western line but it was one that brought him into frequent conflict with the then president of Yugoslavia, Kostunica. Their differences were never greater than over the question of whether Milosevic should be extradited to face the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. It was Djindjic who sanctioned Milosevic's extradition in June 2001. The following day an international donors' conference in Brussels offered Yugoslavia $US1.28billion in grants and loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic was universally recognised as a powerful intellect and an organiser of prodigious talents. But as with many politicians of his generation there was always doubt as to what, if any, were his core beliefs, and he never enjoyed the popular support accorded to his fellow intellectual and opponent, Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Serbian presidential elections of 2002, Djindjic chose to back Miroslav Labus rather than run himself. Nevertheless, to many Serbs Djindjic remained what one British newspaper had called him after the fall of Milosevic: &quot;the shadow kingmaker&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Djindjic is survived by his wife Ruzica, a lawyer, and by a son and a daughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is a disaster for people like me,'' a Serb friend told me on the phone from Belgrade the other day. ''Now we are never going to get rid of him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is just as well that NATO has not declared the removal of Slobodan Milosevic as a war aim. In keeping with Nietzsche's dictum, that which has not killed Milosevic has made him stronger.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time in his political career, he is enjoying the unconditional support of a majority of Serbs. Politicians who hate the Yugoslav president, as well as army malcontents who have been plotting his overthrow, have prudently decided to rally behind him or suspend their opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bourgeois intellectuals and the trendy young are finding that, beneath their European veneer, a Serb heart is beating. ''Only unity can save the Serbs'' runs the old slogan. Now, for once, Serbdom is unified -- thanks to NATO .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a strong streak of paranoia in the Serb psyche. As a result, many will find a perverse satisfaction in the bombing. Serbs are always being told by their leaders that the world is against them. Now they know it is true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What they do not know is why NATO has gone to war with them. Viewed from outside Yugoslavia, it is hard to understand how Serb citizens can apparently condone the ethnic cleansing and murder that is being carried out on their behalf by Milosevic's forces in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, of course, is not how the conflict has been presented. From the outset, the state-controlled media have portrayed it as struggle between the security forces and Albanian ''terrorists,'' who specialize in cowardly attacks on policemen and Serb civilians in their drive to break away from Yugoslavia and establish an independent state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a picture that few bothered to challenge. Animosity toward the Albanians runs deep. Kosovo, with its Serb Orthodox foundations and battle site of the Field of Blackbirds (on which the Battle of Kosovo Polje was fought in 1389, when the Serb and Turkish armies met and the flower of Serbdom was slain) is genuinely dear to Serbs, though as an idea rather than a reality. Few visit, let alone choose to settle there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When NATO bombs began to fall, the first reaction of many was astonishment. It was as if the U.S. decided to bombard Britain because it was unhappy with our treatment of the IRA. That feeling has now given way to a mood of resolution and stoicism, qualities that the Serbs have frequently demonstrated in their stormy history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, almost everything that NATO does simply reinforces those feelings. A bomb fell on the town of Kragujevac, a bastion of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 500 young men volunteered for the forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The raids on factories and infrastructure targets are failing to have the demoralizing effect for which the allies rashly hoped. If anything, they are reinforcing social solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO is facing a country that is more united than at any time since the break-up of the Yugoslav federation. The allies' psychological campaign against the Serb people appears to have been no more effective than the air campaign.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SERBIA'S protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> scored an important victory yesterday when a team of international mediators unequivocally upheld opposition wins in local elections and called on President Slobodan Milosevic to respect the will of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judgment by the Organisation of Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), was greeted with jubilation in Belgrade by crowds of opposition supporters who have protested daily since the government refused to accept a string of defeats in major cities in municipal elections on November 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the celebrations turned sour as night fell, when police clashed with protesters returning home from a rally. Witnesses said police attacked with truncheons after being jeered. At least one person was beaten unconscious, and two foreign television crews were attacked and had their cameras smashed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OSCE findings are not legally binding but they present Mr Milosevic with a stark choice. If he accepts them, they could provide a face-saving way out of the deadlocked confrontation.  If he ignores the judgment, he will make it clear that he would rather resume the role of international pariah than share even a token slice of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former Spanish foreign minister, Felipe Gonzalez, who led an OSCE mission to Serbia last weekend, said the opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition had won local polls in 13 disputed cities and towns and in nine Belgrade municipalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a press conference in Geneva, Mr Gonzalez said the Serbian courts annulled the results on the basis of arguments &quot;that no democratic country could have accepted&quot;.  His report recommended that the 53-nation OSCE issue an urgent call on the authorities &quot;to implement the will of the citizens as expressed in the polls&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Spanish mediator said he telephoned Mr Milosevic to inform him of the findings and asked for a response by early next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There exists an extraordinary opportunity for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to solve this concrete problem, to initiate real democracy in the country, and to reintegrate itself into the international community,&quot; said Mr Gonzalez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An OSCE council meeting is expected in Vienna before the end of next week to consider Mr Milosevic's response. Diplomats say economic sanctions, lifted after last year's Bosnian peace agreement, could be reimposed if he refuses to compromise. Russia, however, has opposed the use of further international pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Belgrade, around 80,000 Zajedno supporters cheered and danced in the street after the ruling was announced. But coalition leaders said they expected the president to choose confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We do not expect him to accept the findings of this commission, we expect further escalation, aggravation,&quot; said Zoran Djindjic, the head of the Democratic Party, one of Zajedno's main forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic called in thousands of riot police on Thursday to manhandle marchers off the streets of Belgrade.  Since then, the demonstrators have confined themselves to marching in circles, blowing trumpets and whistles and shouting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> slogans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blatant election-rigging by the government has already torpedoed the prospect of international financial sanctions being lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But independent analysts have expressed concern that trade sanctions would not significantly weaken Mr Milosevic, who presides over an already devastated economy in a country where much of the population has fallen back on subsistence agriculture and supports the Serbian strongman out of a tradition of deference born of half a century of communism.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THOSE PEOPLE who represent the war against Nato as another battle of Kosovo Polje are insulting our heritage as well as the Serbian Orthodox Church,&quot; said Father Sava Janjic. &quot;In 1389 Prince Lazar carried the holy cross into battle; today, instead of the cross we have instruments of torture, and instead of the noble prince we have indicted war criminals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Father Sava was speaking within the leafy precincts of the 14th-century monastery of Gracanica, a short distance south of Pristina, the provincial capital. It is one of the reasons why Kosovo is considered the seat of Serbian Orthodoxy: Gracanica and other monasteries are the oldest foundations in the faith. Today the head of Serbian Orthodoxy, Patriarch Pavle Ras- Prizren, will officiate at a solemn liturgy in the monastery to commemorate the 610th anniversary of the battle of Kosovo Polje (the Field of Blackbirds), which is seen by Serbs as the key to their national identity. For many others, however, the battle is significant because of its exploitation by Slobodan Milosevic, through which he enlisted the support of many in the Church.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Serbian Orthodox hierarchy did much to foster the tide of Serbian nationalism which Mr Milosevic later rode. In 1987 bishops decided to take the relics of Prince Lazar in procession from monastery to monastery, an event which attracted huge crowds and helped to re-establish the Church at the centre of the Serbs' sense of nationhood. In April the same year Mr Milosevic, then an obscure Communist Party official, gave the speech which was to make his career. At Kosovo Polje, the mainly Serb satellite town of Pristina named after the battle, he put himself at the head of Serbian nationalists who had been fighting the police, telling them: &quot;Nobody should dare to beat you!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two years later, having risen to the verge of the Yugoslav presidency, Mr Milosevic came to Kosovo to commemorate the 600th anniversary of the battle. On 28 April 1989, amid scenes of adulation not seen since the death of Tito in 1980, he spoke to a crowd of a million people. Behind him on the podium was a row of Orthodox bishops. Reminded of this a decade later, Father Sava said: &quot;The Orthodox Church does not have a unified political standpoint. There are a lot of deluded people in our number - probably many of them still support Milosevic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Kosovo in which the 610th anniversary will be marked is very different from a year ago, let alone a decade ago. Yugoslav security forces have gone, and the Nato troops who replaced them are struggling to protect an ever -dwindling Serb minority from the revenge of the Albanian population. Yesterday the people of Belo Polje, a Serbian village near Pec, fled to the city's monastery after Albanians, said to be in Kosovo Liberation Army uniforms, burned and looted their homes. They also allegedly raped and murdered a mentally ill Serbian woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday too, Miodrag Zivic, a school porter at Laplje Selo village, only a mile or two from Gracanica, was buried after being beaten and shot four times by Albanians. British K-For troops took him to hospital, but he never regained consciousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Momcilo Trajkovic, the leader in Kosovo of the Serbian Resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> party, was Zivic's cousin. In the heat outside the house where women were wailing over the body, he said: &quot;This funeral is the result of Milosevic's policies, Albanian terrorism and the failings of the international community, but above all Milosevic.&quot; Events such as his cousin's death would weigh heavily at today's commemoration, but he added: &quot;That ceremony, like this one, is a religious event, not a political one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Before the present situation the Church did allow itself to be used, but Patriarch Pavle and Bishop Artemije (head of the Church in Kosovo) tried to prevent it. Artemije spoke for the people of Kosovo. He was never a supporter of Milosevic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the monastery, Father Sava too was seeking to distance the Church from any of the anniversary's political connotations. &quot;Each year we would commemorate the battle in a religious way, and other people would stage a march. The two were in parallel.&quot; But Patriarch Pavle also plans to speak at the monument to the battle at Gazimestan, just north of Kosovo Polje town, creating a potential security nightmare for K-For.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Father Sava's own credentials are not in doubt: during the war he sheltered dozens of Albanians from Serbian death squads at Decani monastery, south of Pec.  But others point out that Patriarch Pavle did not come out against Mr Milosevic until after the war was over, and that it took another Serbian defeat - the Croatian seizure of Krajina in 1995, which sent 250,000 refugees into Serbia - to convince Bishop Artemije of the dangers of Serbian expansionism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bishop has spoken out courageously in the past year, calling for a ceasefire last summer when Serbian forces launched an offensive against the KLA. Two days after the Nato bombing campaign began, he condemned killing and looting in Kosovo, but his statement was ignored by Belgrade's media. No other condemnation of ethnic cleansing was heard from the Church; Patriarch Pavle said in Belgrade that Nato was &quot;doomed to failure&quot;. Only after Nato forces had begun entering Kosovo did the Serbian Orthodox synod call for Mr Milosevic's resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, as Bishop Artemije and other Church leaders emerged from a meeting in Pristina with UN representatives, they were booed and hissed. The bishop fled to Gracanica from his seat in Prizren, in south-western Kosovo, after one priest was kidnapped, others threatened and Church buildings damaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The irony is that the 14th-century battle of Kosovo Polje was a defeat for Serbian expansionism: Prince Lazar fell fighting the forces of Islam, and Serbia did not regain control of Kosovo until early this century. If there is any modern parallel, it is probably here. The dream of a Greater Serbia, cheered on by most of the Orthodox clergy, has brought only disaster and defeat. As a result, the most holy places of the faith may once again be islands in an Islamic sea, for a long time to come.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAPLJE SELO, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wheat is ready for harvest, but the combines are out of gas and Serb farmers are scared to work the fields. They sit in the shade of a cherry tree, cursing war and drinking homemade brandy until their wives collect them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just beyond them, NATO troops patrol narrow roads. Returning ethnic Albanian refugees seek revenge for years of Serb oppression. There seems no safe place. And the men are angry that the Kosovo land their families have farmed for centuries is suddenly in jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brandy stops flowing and words grow more bitter when someone mentions President Slobodan Milosevic. The Serb farmers of Laplje Selo, like increasing numbers of their countrymen, despise him. They blame Milosevic for plundering a country and twisting Serb nationalism into a sin that triggered NATO air strikes and saddled a bankrupt Yugoslavia with $40 billion worth of ruin.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A crook,&quot; says one farmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Evil,&quot; says another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disdain for Milosevic is sweeping Yugoslavia. Elderly Serbs surviving on pensions of $22 a month marched against Milosevic last week in Belgrade. Tens of thousands of others - including underpaid soldiers - joined </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies in Cacak and other cities, demanding his resignation. The Serbian Orthodox Church has called for him to step down. Crown Prince Alexander, heir to Yugoslavia's exiled monarchy, described Milosevic as a &quot;monster&quot; who &quot;must go, for the sake of Yugoslavia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surge of opposition is reminiscent of 1996, when students and intellectuals protested Milosevic's corrupt regime and militant nationalism that was tugging Yugoslavia further away from Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic outlasted his detractors, dividing opposition leaders and strengthening his power. Some diplomats predict Milosevic will escape defeat again, but many Serbs say their president has shamed them for the last time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's the traitor to Serb nationalism,&quot; said Momcilo Trajkovic, president of the Serbian Democratic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a small opposition party founded by Trajkovic in his hometown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He ruined the Serbs,&quot; he said. &quot;He betrayed our interests. He took us into war and he left us. He destroyed his own blood, and he has made the Serbs victims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notion of any collective culpability never comes up in conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laplje Selo's farmers say Milosevic did the most damage here, amid fields of loamy soils their families have tilled since the 14th century. The wellspring of Serb orthodox religion and tradition, Kosovo is now essentially a NATO protectorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a stunning reversal of fortune, the Serbs, who once controlled Kosovo with paramilitary police, are increasingly vulnerable to ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbs of Laplje Selo don't like the odds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across Kosovo, ethnic Albanians are looting and burning Serb homes. Serbs are winding up dead on roadsides. More than 80,000 of Kosovo's 200,000 Serbs have fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of Laplje Selo's 2,000 residents are staying put, though many farmers have sent their wives and children away until tensions ease. And a few village leaders, such as the baker, Stojan Nedeljkovic, are packing cars and tractors with furniture and clothes, just in case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remaining in the village is difficult, as farmers such as Zika Jovic can't sell summer squash and other vegetables because ethnic Albanians are boycotting Serb products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one wants our cheese, bread or vegetables,&quot; said Jovic. &quot;We have to give it to the cows to eat. I have to sell eggs to buy cigarettes, but now I can't even go to the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're scared. We're like prisoners. Milosevic promised so much. But we have nothing. There's not even room for us in Serbia if we leave Kosovo. The wars Milosevic started in Bosnia and Croatia have already flooded the country with Serb refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southwest of the Kosovo capital of Pristina, where the land flattens, Laplje Selo is marked by the silver domes of St. Sveta Petka church. The cemetery is wild with weeds and shiny with black granite markers, some bearing the names - as folklore has it - of those cursed to die young because their parents once sold land to Albanians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Centuries ago, Serbs battled the Turks for this land. Then came the Germans. And last summer, 200 village men grabbed rifles and formed night patrols to protect 1,500 acres of wheat from guerrillas in the Kosovo Liberation Army. They feared the KLA might torch the fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zika Jovic was one of the night watchmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Jovic's eyes are bloodshot, his face half-shaved. He says 78 days of NATO bombing frayed his nerves. And he's worried that ethnic Albanians will burn and loot Laplje Selo as they seek vengeance for the bloody oppression and so-called ethnic cleansing wrought by Milosevic's forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's ironic, he says, how quickly Serbs have become victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here I am thinking about fleeing my home, and there sits Milosevic still in power,&quot; said Jovic. &quot;It's time to get rid of him. I don't really follow politics. I don't even care who's in power anymore. Even an Albanian would be fine with me. I just want my freedom. . . . I'm scared to leave this village.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down the road at the village's cooperative farm office, the combines needed gasoline. War disrupted supplies, and farmers say Albanians are selling to Serbs at highly inflated prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Momcilo Trajkovic, the president of the Serbian Democratic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said: &quot;I feel the anger of Albanians. But now there is a tragedy against the Serbs, and NATO is doing little to stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slavoljub Mitic stopped at Zivko Nacic's general store for a beer. Rain, sweeping across the wheat fields, chased him and other men under a corrugated tin roof. They sat, listened to thunder, joked about NATO cluster bombs, and talked about 1389, when Serbian Prince Lazar battled the Turks on Kosovo's Field of Blackbirds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lazar's army was defeated, and he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But every Serb child is taught the poem about the epic battle, the bravery, the religious devotion, and the myths that sprang from Kosovo. Mitic remembers in 1989 when Milosevic traveled to Kosovo and ignited his political career by extolling Serb nationalism and the virtues of the prince.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mitic said Milosevic is no Lazar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need changes in Yugoslavia,&quot; said Mitic. &quot;We need Milosevic out. He lost Bosnia. He lost Croatia. Now, he's lost Kosovo. He lost it all. It's over. . . . Kosovo is the Serbian soul. Milosevic will be remembered in history for losing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two heavily armed NATO soldiers walked past. Mitic and the others watched them round the bend in the road. Some of the men worried that NATO is not protecting their village, and many fear attacks from Albanians if they go to harvest their wheat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must do this harvest no matter what the fear,&quot; said Rade Djorovic. &quot;My family has been here for centuries. I have never missed a harvest. Fear has never kept us out of the fields.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearby, Jelica Petrovic, rose from a porch and strolled to the dusty shed where her nephew, Vladimir, makes tombstones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She pointed to the tombstone of her cousin, Novica Petkovic. Born 1922. Died 1998. It sometimes takes a while, she said, before her nephew actually delivers the stone to the cemetery at St. Sveta Petka church. Novica, a farmer, died of natural causes before the NATO air strikes, the flood of Albanian refugees, and the mass graves dug by Serb paramilitary gangs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laplje Selo's most recent death was not peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dragi Zivic, a school janitor, was shot by Albanians just beyond the thicket near the gas station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess we'll do his tombstone later,&quot; said Petrovic. &quot;Milosevic got us into these problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Serbia -- Every afternoon, thousands of protesters fill<BR>the city center with a deafening, cacophonous roar of whistles,<BR>horns, cow bells and chants.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each night, promptly at the 7:30 start of the state TV news, people<BR>bang pots and pans and honk car horns to drown out, at least symbolically,<BR>government propaganda.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's an extraordinary scene, this national catharsis, an unprecedented<BR>venting of anger and disgust at the ruling regime. To American<BR>eyes, these opposition tactics, full of passion and dreams, resemble<BR>the democratic wave that washed across Eastern Europe after the<BR>collapse of the Berlin Wall.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Serbia is not Poland, where the Solidarity union waged a decade-long<BR>battle against communists. Nor is it Romania, where the execution<BR>of communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu bloodied the transition<BR>to democracy.<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most analysts feel the danger of a violent crackdown by the Socialist<BR>Party regime has passed. The army has declared its neutrality.<BR>And if President Slobodan Milosevic were to order his battalions<BR>of flak-jacketed riot police to use force, he would pay a stiff<BR>price in world opinion -- and financial aid.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international financing desperately needed to resuscitate<BR>Serbia's wheezing economy would be out of reach, perhaps for good.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Serbia is still a protest, not yet a<BR>revolution.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1970s movie </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Network,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a deranged TV anchorman, fed<BR>up with society's outrages, demands that viewers open their windows<BR>and scream into the darkness: &quot;I'm mad as hell and I'm not going<BR>to take it anymore.&quot; Two decades later, all of Belgrade appears<BR>to have heeded his call.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mingling with the happy protesters, the noise is overwhelming.<BR>The din overrides everything, making conversation -- even in shouts<BR>-- all but impossible.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, there are two parallel protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political opposition attracts several thousand, mostly middle-class<BR>Serbians for afternoon speeches by the leadership troika: Vuk<BR>Draskovic, Zoran Djindic, and Vesna Pesic. In the evening, students<BR>from the University of Belgrade take to the streets. In American<BR>terms, it's as if 1960s Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman and Richard<BR>Nixon's &quot;Silent Majority&quot; joined forces.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two anti-government camps are allies but only to a point.<BR>&quot;We fight against the government, not for the opposition,&quot; says<BR>Jelena Petrovic, 22, a student of molecular biology.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if noise is one hallmark of the protests, humor is the students'<BR>calling card. During one all-night protest, students took turns<BR>reading to the police works of Greek philosophy. A cartoon on<BR>a kind of &quot;Democracy Wall&quot; outside the student center shows<BR>Arnold Schwarzenegger in full Terminator regalia under the legend:<BR>&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Hasta La Vista Communista</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">!&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students' presence in the streets is crucial. Milosevic has<BR>attacked the political opposition as traitors and foreign spies.<BR>And the coalition early on played into his hands by waving U.S.<BR>and German flags at its rallies. It's more difficult to make such<BR>charges against the students, many of whom are 18 or 19 years<BR>old.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The enemy of the good</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History hangs over everything here. The Balkans is a region of<BR>long memories. Each June 28th, Serbs commemorate a battle fought<BR>against Turk oppressors in 1389 -- a battle Serbs lost.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a brief period at the beginning of this century, Serbia was<BR>one of Europe's democracies. But in 1914 the moment passed. The<BR>current generation has known only dictators.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the end of World War II until 1980, Serbia was part of the<BR>former Yugoslavia, which was ruled until his death by Marshal<BR>Tito. Tito fashioned a home-grown communism, which took root in<BR>a way that Soviet-imposed regimes never did elsewhere in eastern<BR>Europe. Through force of personality, Tito held together a multiethnic<BR>state of Serbs, Croats, Montenegrans and Bosnians, allowing the<BR>people certain freedom so long as nationalist passions were in<BR>check.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cold War's collapse unleashed democratic aspirations across<BR>eastern Europe. But Milosevic, who took power in 1987, was able<BR>to avoid the fate of leaders like East Germany's Eric Honecker,<BR>exiled to South America, or Romania's Ceausescu, executed by opponents.<BR>He stayed in office by channeling nationalist passions into a<BR>genocidal war in Bosnia.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the war, there were scattered protests. But by last November,<BR>when balloting began in federal and local elections, the regime<BR>had reason to feel secure. The Dayton accords, which ended the<BR>war, secured for Milosevic greater international support. And<BR>on Nov. 3, his ruling Socialist Party handily won federal elections.<BR>It also seemed headed for a big win in the municipal elections<BR>two weeks later.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But results in those elections were a shock. Normally, one-quarter<BR>of voters participate in local elections. This time, more than<BR>70% showed up, giving opposition parties control of 14 of the<BR>country's 20 largest cities, including Belgrade, the capital.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stunned officials reacted by invalidating opposition victories,<BR>sending crowds of up to 200,000 into the streets.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight weeks later, the opposition has surprised itself. Never<BR>before has an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stayed in the streets for<BR>so long. The last time, in 1992, the regime used tanks.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the opposition remains weaker than it could be. Some potential<BR>allies have offered as much criticism as support. Workers, intellectuals<BR>and some democrats have held back.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vojislav Kostunica, the head of the Democratic Party of Serbia,<BR>complains the opposition is mistaken to rely so much on international<BR>pressure. &quot;For people who have not experienced democracy, it's<BR>important that democracy grows in this country,&quot; he says. &quot;If<BR>it was somehow imported, it would not give people the right idea.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even opposition leaders caution against optimistic predictions.<BR>&quot;What's happening on the streets can create the wrong impression,&quot;<BR>Djindjic told USA TODAY. &quot;Milosevic has more than 50% (support).<BR>We have something below 50%. Is now the moment to remove him or<BR>just shake him a bit? I'm not sure.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are skeptical of the opposition leaders themselves, accusing<BR>them of dabbling in nationalism when such beliefs were popular.<BR>Pesic, head of the tiny Civic Alliance, a party of intellectuals,<BR>is immune to such charges. But she has little influence. Draskovic,<BR>an advocate of &quot;Greater Serbia,&quot; and Djindic, who had close<BR>ties to the Bosnian Serbs, are not listening.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miladin Zivotic, one of Serbia's leading intellectuals and a longtime<BR>foe of nationalism, leads a group called Belgrade Circle. A recent<BR>morning found half a dozen people in his outer office, smoking<BR>cigarettes and watching a small color television. Zivotic was<BR>pessimistic about prospects for democracy.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of today's opponents &quot;were completely involved in preparing<BR>this war, creating this hate speech,&quot; he says.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The frail trade union </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also has been wary. Labor leaders<BR>haven't forgotten that the opposition failed to support workers<BR>against the state. Government harassment has whittled the independent<BR>union's numbers to 135,000 from 300,000 five years ago. Branislav<BR>Canak, union president, was fired from his job with state radio<BR>for his union activities. Fearing the same for his members, he's<BR>kept the union flags furled. &quot;The average citizen can be beaten,&quot;<BR>he says from behind a desk piled high in papers. &quot;Our members<BR>lose their jobs.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the border of disaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's Serbian economy resembles one of its best known exports<BR>to the United States, the notorious Yugo automobile. The government's<BR>handling of elections sparked the protests. But equally important<BR>in keeping people in the street in cold, snow and rain is the<BR>erosion in living standards. &quot;If you compare this way of living<BR>and economy to Tito's era, then we were living in paradise,&quot;<BR>says Gordana Logar, a veteran journalist.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war, economic sanctions by the west, and government cronyism<BR>has crippled Serbia's economy. Employment in the steel industry,<BR>which was 466,000 in 1991, is now 50,000. And the plants that<BR>employ those lucky few often lack the energy or raw materials<BR>to actually make anything. Unemployment, huge even before the<BR>war, was made worse by international sanctions and a flood of<BR>refugees unable to return home. Average salaries are around 100<BR>dinars, or $ 25, a month.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ljljana Raskovic, 36, lost her job after eight years. &quot;The money<BR>is gone. There are no jobs,&quot; she says. She motions toward her<BR>two little girls, ages 6 and 8, as she tears up. &quot;I'm coming<BR>for the future of my kids, if nothing else.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic has tried to remedy economic problems the old-fashioned<BR>way: by printing money. A hike in state pensions just before the<BR>November election was funded this way, says Milan Potic, head<BR>of the independent Center for Serbian Studies. That led to inflation.<BR>In one day late last year, the dinar lost more than 25% of its<BR>value against the German mark.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Serbia is on the border of financial disaster,&quot; says<BR>Carl Bildt, the chief international envoy in Bosnia.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now, the really hard part</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than two months of protests have produced cracks in the regime.<BR>The army and Serbian Orthodox Church have moved to the sidelines.<BR>Milosevic's ruling party is reportedly divided on how to respond<BR>to the protests. Even some riot police, waiting in their buses<BR>one block from the protests, can be seen reading opposition newspapers.<BR>Milosevic conceded that opponents won in Serbia's second-largest<BR>city, Nis.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Milosevic, though wounded, remains formidable. His aim appears<BR>to be to end the student protest by meeting their demand to replace<BR>two university officials, thus weakening the opposition. Few think<BR>he will leave power.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His major weapon now is state radio and TV, which have alternately<BR>ignored the opposition and branded it the work of foreign spies<BR>and traitors.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the opposition, taking control of the local governments it<BR>won in November would be a mixed blessing. It would mean control<BR>of local radio and television outlets, thus shattering the government's<BR>monopoly on information. But opposition leaders would also be<BR>saddled with the chores that bedevil municipal politicians from<BR>Warsaw to Washington, D.C.: picking up the trash, keeping potholes<BR>filled and boosting the economy. And they would have to tackle<BR>them without money since an unfriendly federal government holds<BR>the purse strings.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it would be good for us to have a drastic change<BR>of government,&quot; says Protic. &quot;The best scenario would be a democratic<BR>and gradual one.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would make people like Miroslav Maric happy. The 19-year-old<BR>student is part of a generation unfazed by the recent war. For<BR>weeks, he's been more or less living on antibiotics and junk food<BR>in a fourth-floor room in the university's philosophy department.<BR>There, a half dozen students sit around a wooden table, eating<BR>crackers and smoking. Political cartoons paper the walls.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe I'm fighting once and for all for democracy here,&quot;<BR>he says. &quot;I don't want any more armies on the street, or sanctions,<BR>war, everything -- it's finally time to get some sense in our<BR>lives.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Milosevic: an authoritarian suddenly turned vicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Punchline of Serb chief is sour joke PATRICK BISHOP in Belgrade reports on a troubled week in Serbian politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WITHIN 24 hours of any political upheaval in Serbia a joke inspired by the event usually does the rounds of the bus queues and cafes in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, following President Slobodan Milosevic's vicious crackdown on the opposition, there was stunned silence. For once, the thought processes of the leader defied the cynical analysis of the pavement philosophers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since coming to prominence, Milosevic has been a jumble of contradictions. He has ridden to power on the back of two ideologies, communism and nationalism - and patently believes in neither.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More interesting, he seemed to be a natural authoritarian who could tolerate dissent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the mask has slipped. In the space of 24 hours last week, he tipped the president of the rump Yugoslavia, Dobrica Cosic, out of office, unleashed the riot police to crush an anti-government demonstration and imprisoned the main Serbian opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic, and his wife, Danica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why, wonders Belgrade's massive chattering class, should Slobo choose this moment to crack down?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the international front, things have been going well for Milosevic, who has managed to rehabilitate himself with the West as a result of his backing for the Vance-Owen plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At home, despite the massive economic hardship stemming from sanctions and the war, there seemed little threat to his rule. President Cosic's hesitant, bet-hedging style of opposition hardly seemed to pose a serious challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge advanced during the no-confidence debate in the federal parliament - that the 72-year-old author was plotting with the chief of the general staff to stage a coup - has been completely uncorroborated so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from two strong statements by his fellow Serbian intellectuals and a pious protest from the Russian foreign ministry, Cosic's removal scarcely raised a peep from opposition circles. Cosic has been a figure of contempt since he accepted the presidency. His belated, and inaccurate, comparison of Milosevic with Hitler and Stalin after his downfall failed to attract any sympathy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstration that erupted in Belgrade the same day had no direct link with his fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It started after a member of the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party beat up a member of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when he dared to read out an embarrassing hymn of praise to Tito penned by the Radicals' leader, Vojislav Seselj, before he abandoned communism for chauvinism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators were voicing a general rage against the style of Milosevic's rule and the hopeless future his policies had landed them with. Even so, there were only 5000 of them; last year the opposition could muster at least 70,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aftermath of the protest has exposed once again the feebleness of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities' treatment of the Draskovics has been outrageous: they were seized in the party headquarters after the demo; both were beaten; they are being held virtually incommunicado in the central prison on charges of trying to overthrow the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reaction of Draskovic's party has been to try to cool things down. They have instructed the provincial branches not to provoke the police by organising protests. The young, the middle-class, the urban intelligentsia who make up Draskovic's constituency appear equally cautious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Draskovic is too emotional,&quot; said one young supporter yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's too much of an intellectual, not enough of a politician.&quot; Despite the violence [a policeman was killed], the demonstration seemed strangely irrelevant. Young people lounged at the pavement cafes chatting as if nothing was happening as crowds of retreating protesters stumbled past, eyes and noses streaming from the tear gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic has virtually no contact with ordinary people. Confronted with individuals over whom he has no direct institutional control - like the deputation of students he met after a spate of anti-government demonstrations two years ago - he reportedly becomes agitated and incoherent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet he is credited with an uncanny ability to sense public moods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By smashing the essentially inconsequential Cosic and the romantic but ineffective Draskovic, he is signalling what most people had already accepted: that the opposition is merely an adornment to Serbia's political system, a bit of baroque cornicing to the bleak, authoritarian structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now it was a luxury he felt he could afford. But there are grim days ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of a peace settlement in Bosnia and with no end in sight to Serbia's economic and diplomatic isolation, dissatisfaction with the regime is bound to deepen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbian opposition may be disorganised and incapable of shaking off its dissident mentality but it provides a focus for the resentment building up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's lesson in the past week to opposition leaders tempted to capitalise on those feelings is that the least they can expect is a broken head and a spell in jail if they do. The prospects for ordinary people thinking of following them are even grimmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is no wonder that on the streets of Belgrade last week's events are no joking matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A long-awaited, once-postponed and politically charged soccer match between Yugoslavia and Croatia passed off peacefully and rather anticlimactically tonight, finishing 0-0, much like the summer's demonstrations against the rule of the Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there was a taste for what might come at a major opposition rally planned for Thursday night in Belgrade when a transformer at the Red Star stadium blew a few minutes into the second half, and the lights went out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Suddenly chants aimed at Mr. Milosevic echoed around the stadium, with many of the 60,000 people there yelling, &quot;Slobo leave!&quot; and a popular, rhyming chant that goes in part, &quot;Slobo, you've sold out Kosovo!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The game was televised nationally, but those chants were not heard by viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wait for the generators to turn the lights back on stretched on for 40 minutes, and officials gave some consideration to replaying the whole game Thursday night. That led to immediate Balkan-style speculation that the Milosevic Government had intentionally blown the power to make sure that the game would conflict with the opposition rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in an indication of the Government's nervousness about Thursday, state television news announced that the police had arrested a man from Cetinje with &quot;an explosive device fitted with a timer,&quot; apparently intended to be set off during the rally in front of the Federal Parliament building. The police then warned, the announcer said, that others could be planning such attacks, and they advised people to be careful, especially regarding their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broadcast seemed a patent effort to discourage people from attending the opposition rally, the first in Belgrade since the Kosovo war. But the opposition is divided, and its best orator, Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has decided not to attend -- at least as of today -- as has the former army chief of staff, Momcilo Perisic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another well-known opposition figure, Vesna Pesic of the Alliance for Change, who had also been expected to speak, instead traveled to Montenegro -- for safety, she said -- after prosecutors asked the police to investigate her on felony charges for seeming to urge the violent overthrow of Mr. Milosevic by citing &quot;the Romanian example&quot; -- an apparent reference to the 1989 uprising against the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a telephone interview today, Ms. Pesic said the charge was ludicrous, but she left &quot;because you never really know with them,&quot; meaning the Government. Asked if the much ballyhooed rally would be important now after so many defections, she said: &quot;Only if the police or the regime starts a battle or an incident. It's now just one of the rallies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, in the southern city of Nis today, Alliance leaders attracted more than 20,000 people to an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally. Zoran Djindjic, head of the Democracy Party, said Thursday's protest in Belgrade would bring the end of Mr. Milosevic closer.  &quot;Stage two of Milosevic's replacement begins in Serbia tomorrow,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Mr. Milosevic appeared to be moving to flummox the opposition again and to call their bluff, with a spokesman suggesting that new elections might be called soon. Ivica Dasic, the spokesman for Mr. Milosevic's party, said: &quot;We believe that there are more important things on the nation's agenda than the elections, but if the opposition wants that, so be it. We are ready.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic favors new elections but the opposition generally has been wary, worried that the Government might manipulate the voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition analysts and officials also say that they are not ready for elections and not sure they could win one now against Mr. Milosevic, especially in coalition with Vojislav Seselj, the Serbian extreme nationalist who is head of the Serbian Radicals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Mr. Seselj said that the Government was ready for new elections and the opposition only has to agree to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Pesic of the Alliance for Change, which does not include Mr. Draskovic, said her coalition probably would not boycott new elections, as it did in 1997. But she suggested that the Alliance would seek to turn the elections into &quot;a referendum on Milosevic&quot; by running a slate of non-partisan experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An opinion poll released today indicated that more than 70 percent of Serbs surveyed want a new Government and an end to the country's isolation. The poll of 1,000 people last week by the independent Partner Marketing Research Agency suggested that Mr. Milosevic and his allies could expect only 24 percent support if elections were held now. The various opposition parties and alliances would get around 40 percent, 18 percent would not vote and 11 percent were undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the margin of error was unclear, and private polling for the opposition parties has produced pessimism among their staff members about new elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In tonight's soccer match, a qualifying round for the European championship, the players, who are professionals, behaved sportingly toward each other. The game was originally scheduled for March 27, but was postponed because NATO had begun bombing Serbia on March 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd was cheerfully venomous toward the Croatian team, drowning out the Croatian national anthem and shouting, over and over, &quot;Kill the Ustashe,&quot; the Croatian fascists of World War II. They seemed more fervent against the Croats than against Mr. Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were dire predictions of what might happen should the Yugoslav side lose to the Croats, whom they had not played since 1991.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of report by Bosnian edition of Croatian daily Vecernji list, on 30 May</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Commentary by Milan Ivkosic in the column &quot;Patriotic Nitpicking&quot;: &quot;Divvying-up Croatia's Submissiveness&quot;]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cheeky fellow comes into your very own house, spits in your face, and you respond as follows: &quot;We have good relations with Serbia, and the fact that Serbian politicians are employing extremist rhetoric and doing so primarily for their own internal purposes is their problem and not ours!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is how Mario Zubovic of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union], chairman of the Assembly's Foreign Policy Committee, responded to the accusation by Serbian Foreign Affairs Minister Vuk Jeremic, uttered in Zagreb at a meeting of the Adriatic-Ionian Initiative, that, in Operation Storm, Croatia had carried out the &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; of more than four million Serbs [as published]. Together with the half-hearted reaction from the state leadership, that has been a typical occurrence in Croatian-Serbian relations for 10 years. It is one that can also be perceived in the name and surnames of the aforementioned pair: Vuk [wolf in Serbian and Croatian] has not abandoned his wolfish nature, and Zubovic, in Ivo Sanader's political ordainment, inherited from Ivica Racan and the SDP [Social Democratic Party], has been left toothless [zub means tooth in Serbian and Croatian].</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That typicality was conceived in 2000, when Racan and Picula, in keeping with the policy and diktat of the EU, gave open support to &quot;the democratization of Serbia&quot; and the &quot;toppling of Slobodan Milosevic.&quot; From the time he came to power in Belgrade, &quot;democrat&quot; Zoran Djindjic would be the symbol of a new, changed, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> democratic Serbia to politicians and the media in Croatia. The real Djindjic would remain behind the opaque curtain of that myth. Only the cleaned-up face of that &quot;civic politician&quot; would be seen in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of some of his statements, some in Croatia would remember that the real Djindjic, but that would not to change the picture of him, so some of the politicians who would lead Serbia after he was killed would be compared to him, as to a political paragon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would thus be &quot;forgotten&quot; that Djindjic, and how, supported the leadership of &quot;Krajina&quot; in Croatia, that he regarded its right to secession to be tantamount to Croatia's and Slovenia's right to secede from Yugoslavia, that, during the time of the most violent attacks on Sarajevo, he was in Pale, where he prepared a banquet with an ox roast for war criminal Radovan Karadzic, that, in 1991, he supported the thesis that &quot;republics' borders are not state borders,&quot; that, after the disappearance of &quot;Krajina,&quot; he supported the annexation of Croatian Podunavlje [Danube basin] to Yugoslavia, that he proposed making Prevlaka a gift to Montenegro, that he ultimately criticized Milosevic not for his great-Serbia programme but for failing to accomplish it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were occasional reminders of that Djindjic here and there, such as when he reacted to Mesic's assessment that Serbia ought to pay Croatia 15 billion euros in damages with the statement that Croatia ought to pay Serbia perhaps as much as 150 billion euros in damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to the &quot;new&quot; Serbia of Djindjic and Djindjic's followers, a Croatian state visit to Belgrade and Mesic's notorious apology would ensue. When the European Union was getting ready to schedule the beginning of negotiations with Croatia, the same Vuk Draskovic who, as minister of foreign affairs, had arranged Sanader's visit to Serbia, rushed around all the major European metropolises so that those negotiations would be denied to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the beginning of this year, with no provocation whatsoever, Serbian President Boris Tadic, in a discussion on Kosovo at the United Nations, accused Croatia of not being a lawful state. What, then, are Mesic's and Sanader's &quot;good relations&quot; with a Serbia in which the Chetnik </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been officially rehabilitated and whose leaders continually wish us ill and work on effectuating it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what is the difference between Nikolic's and Tadic's Serbia, other than that Nikolic causes no surprise with his policies whereas Tadic sandbags you with his policies every now and then? Serbian politicians of the left and the right are aware of how submissive Croatia is to the European masters' governments of both the left and the right, and Jeremic's cheekiness at a European gathering in the middle of Zagreb is merely a sign that, in the future, Belgrade is going to try to come away with an even bigger portion of that submissiveness as shared booty with Brussels.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section E; Column 1; The Arts/Cultural Desk; Pg. 7</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">942 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the decade between Washington's two wars against Saddam Hussein, who was demonized by his adversaries as the butcher of Baghdad, the focus of Western foreign policy and the target of American military power was another cagey leader of a small country with strategic location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">     Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, demonized by his adversaries as the butcher of the Balkans, guided a series of wars against the constituent republics of his fragmenting nation that impoverished the Serbian people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he was bold and shrewd, adept at advancing his agenda by riding lies through the gaps in a NATO alliance that had blocked the Soviet menace but that was unable or unwilling to halt bloodletting in one of the last corners of Europe to emerge from dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yugoslavia: The Fall of Milosevic,&quot; a three-part documentary that will be rebroadcast tonight on the Discovery Times Channel, immediately establishes the significance of its protagonist as the first head of state to be brought before an international tribunal on charges of war crimes and genocide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documentary was originally produced for the BBC, which showed it in January. Its respected executive producers, Norma Percy and Brian Lapping, have developed a method of intense interviews with key participants that has worked wonderfully well in documentaries like &quot;The Second Russian Revolution&quot; (1991), &quot;The Death of Yugoslavia&quot; (1995) and &quot;The 50 Years War: Israel and the Arabs&quot; (1998).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three hours of &quot;The Fall of Milosevic&quot; describe the autumn of his political career in detail. The period includes the failed attempt at maintaining authoritarian control over Kosovo and its majority population of ethnic Albanians; NATO's air war, which did little to halt the Milosevic offensive until bombs fell on Belgrade, the Serbian capital; and the revolution from below in which the Serbian people finally voted him from power and then took it from him when he refused to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little examination of his Communist roots or of his blossoming as a leader of a tribal Serbian nationalism. There is scant description of the vicious, Medieval-style wars of siege and looting and rape elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia, even though it was the West's belated action to halt &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; in Croatia and Bosnia that eventually shamed NATO into action over Kosovo. For Western capitals that sat idly by while Bosnia burned, &quot;Never again&quot; had arrived once more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The series provides an invaluable summary of the complicated events that riveted world attention as the 1990's spilled into a new decade, and Ms. Percy, Mr. Lapping and their collaborators have gone to extraordinary lengths to capture the voices of every principal participant. Those interviewed include Presidents Bill Clinton, Jacques Chirac and Boris N. Yeltsin, Prime Minister Tony Blair, Kosovo's guerrillas and its nascent diplomats, the bulldozer driver who helped lead the Serbian people's seizure of the parliament in Belgrade and, of course, Mr. Milosevic himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The telescoping of history that is the documentarian's art reveals fascinating details that are difficult to judge as they are happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who hardly lived up to their early publicity as heroic Balkan Minutemen, revel in a cult of martyrdom. They perverted cease-fires to strike at Serbian forces, hoping for brutal counterattacks that would stoke Washington and Brussels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How unexpected, though, to hear similar strategy from the intellectual leaders of the American-subsidized, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> political </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otpor, which mobilized opposition candidates in Belgrade. Most of Otpor's foot soldiers were average citizens of Serbia dreaming, if not of democracy, then of an end to war and isolation, and their platform was nonviolent revolt. But among Otpor's leaders were those who also understood the cult of victimization. They, too, planned provocations and bragged that each violent arrest earned a thousand votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armchair generals and a few at the Pentagon will no doubt take notes during an enlightening exchange on the air war. Mirjana Markovic, wife of Mr. Milosevic, describes how Belgrade's leaders viewedthe United States as spineless, NATO as a joke. The bombing, they were certain, would last one night, and the West would dab its forehead and fly home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An American Air Force officer then recalls how his pilots pleaded for missions in the first three days of the war because they were certain that Serbia, as the neighborhood Balkan bully, would run at the first bloody nose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both, of course, were wrong. The air war lasted 78 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parts 1 and 2 of the series, &quot;Defiance&quot; and &quot;War,&quot; are well-made pieces of diplomatic and military history. Part 3, &quot;Finished,&quot; is not only good history but good drama as well, the story of the election and people-power revolution that ultimately ousted Mr. Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documentary is eloquent in reminding viewers that it was not armed Kosovar guerrillas nor NATO diplomacy nor even the American military that bested the Serbian leader. It was the people of Serbia, the students and coal diggers and rock drummers and mothers who took to the ballot box and then to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Fall of Milosevic&quot; is compelling history, even if the heroes of the Belgrade street protests are today locked in political inertia, failing to deliver the reform pledged when they rid the nation of Mr. Milosevic and packed him off to the Hague, to a jail cell and a war-crimes trial.<BR><BR>YUGOSLAVIA<BR>The Fall of Milosevic<BR><BR>DISCOVERY TIMES, tonight at 8, Eastern and Pacific times; 7, Central time.<BR><BR>Brian Lapping and Norma Percy, executive producers; David Ash, international reversion producer.<BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia has elected to confront his opponents, who not only want to get back election victories but also to oust him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appeared that Milosevic's courts would deny the opposition its local election victories. Radomir Lazarevic, the chief of the Belgrade election commission, said the Supreme Court had rejected appeals that would have reinstated election victories in Belgrade. The court has yet to rule on overturned elections in other cities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 100,000 demonstrators filled the streets of Belgrade on Sunday. Former French Culture Minister Jack Lang, a member of the European Parliament, told a cheering crowd: &quot;The Serbs are fighting in the name of all peoples who resist dictatorship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition Democratic Party reported Sunday that eight protesters were arrested in the past two days, and one of them was badly beaten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters have been on the streets every day since the Nov. 17 elections were annulled by courts that Milosevic controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But instead of turning police officers loose on the demonstrators - as he has in the past - Milosevic appeared headed for a long struggle of tactics and politics. &quot;What will prevail - the people's determination, or Milosevic's patience?&quot; asked Zoran Djindjic, leader of the opposition Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A co-leader of the opposition coalition, Vuk Draskovic, said the choice for Serbs was simple: dignity or slavery. &quot;We are not ready to be slaves!&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am expecting tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, that Milosevic will use police, maybe even the army, but we will not stop,&quot; Draskovic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daily protests in Serbia's second-largest city, Nis, also continued Sunday; the election results there also were overturned. The Fonet news agency said about 30,000 people - including students, taxi drivers, workers and farmers on their tractors - turned out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weeks Of Protests</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition had anticipated that Milosevic would try to calm three weeks of protests by giving back its election victory in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nov. 17 runoff local elections, the official electoral commission announced that a majority of the 110 seats on Belgrade's city council had been won by the opposition coalition, Together. But local courts annulled the results in Belgrade as well as opposition victories that had been announced elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition and the Belgrade election commission appealed to Serbia's Supreme Court, which had previously confirmed the lower courts' actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic said Milosevic apparently had realized that the protests wouldn't dissipate even if he gave in on the elections. &quot;It became obvious that these protests would not stop if Belgrade was given back to us, and it's also obvious that this protest has defined itself as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and anti-Communist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milan Komnenic, vice president of Draskovic's Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Supreme Court rulings couldn't change the protesters' motivation. &quot;Our strength is in our determination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some independent unions have pledged to join the protests today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, individual workers have taken part in the street marches, but organized labor has not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bosnian Follow-up Force</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said Sunday that he would press for an early end to U.S. participation in NATO's planned follow-on peacekeeping force in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called President Bill Clinton's decision to let U.S. soldiers stay for up to 18 months more a &quot;big mistake.&quot; Kasich would have them home by spring.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this 29th day of NATO's war against Yugoslavia, it's worthwhile to look at what the situation is like on the ground throughout the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forced departure of the ethnic Albanian community from Kosovo appears to be in its final stage. In the absence of reliable census figures, popular opinion puts Kosovo's prewar population at two million of which 10 per cent were alleged to be Serbs. Informed sources suggest that the overall figure was significantly less, but we will probably only know for sure when we count the refugees expelled from Kosovo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the past year, about one million Albanians have been forced or convinced to leave the province, which means between 300,000 and 400,000 remain, and many of them are moving in the direction of Kosovo's borders with Macedonia and Albania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The air campaign and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's reaction to it has accelerated the removal of the Albanian population. This fact combined with Yugoslavia's paranoia regarding a NATO land invasion and the Serb army's desire to clear all civilians from Kosovo to enhance what they see as an inevitable defensive battle does not auger well for any Albanians remaining in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yugoslavia's infrastructure and military complexes have suffered billions of dollars in damage. Oil refineries have been put out of commission, and fuel supplies stored in the open are targeted on a daily basis. Most bridges over the Danube are destroyed, the three in Belgrade being the exception. Electronic communications facilities of all types have been severely degraded and few transmission towers are standing. As far as civilian casualties are concerned, ''only'' 1,000 people have been killed or injured by the bombing campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yugoslav army has suffered considerable damage in Kosovo. But considering the dearth of information from that area, it is impossible to gauge how much its operational effectiveness has been reduced. Considering the number of caves, tunnels and bunkers in Kosovo, it is probably safe to say the army is still an effective and formidable fighting force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is neighbouring Macedonia is highly unstable because of the massive influx of Albanian refugees. Macedonia's political situation is precarious at the best of times considering its ethnic mix. The presence of hundreds of thousands of refugees combined with Macedonia's 25-per-cent Albanian population is seen as a considerable threat by most of the remaining citizens.  NATO's forces buildup of at least 12,000 is seen as an additional threat because of the potential for cross-border operations into Macedonia by Serb forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albania, the poorest country in the region, is under immense pressure from its considerable share of the refugee exodus. Cross-border operations in remote border regions are commonplace, and NATO's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of about 8,000 troops into the area along with Apache helicopters and multiple rocket launchers increase the potential for such attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 'neutral' Montenegro, there is much anticipation of a coup by the Yugoslavian army to displace a pro-western, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government. Many Montenegrans are confused and upset that they are on NATO's target lists. Despite the fact that mostly military targets have been struck, many think the attacks are unjustified and unfair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as Mr. Milosevic is concerned, there are no evident cracks in his intransigence. Diplomatic delegations parade through his office on a daily basis, but there have been no hints of even a minor breakthrough. Successful diplomacy is a secretive process, and the public will not be aware of any progress on that front until there is a major development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news is that there appears to be an increased level of activities by senior Yugoslav officials. They seem to be preoccupied with what I can only assume are numerous diplomatic initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's hope one of them works.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton administration's rejuvenated Bosnia policy has scored major gains and offers real hope that the country can be kept together. But we and our allies continue to artificially separate what happens in Bosnia from what happens in Serbia. That was a disaster six years ago, and it could be a disaster again for Bosnia and the Dayton process. The issue in Serbia is increasingly the province of Kosovo, a part of Serbia but hardly only an internal Serbian problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic wiped away Kosovo's autonomy eight years ago, the Albanian population there has considered itself no longer part of Serbia and has acted that way. The Kosovo Albanians have elected their own &quot;government&quot; and maintained their own health and education systems. But Belgrade still rules -- and with a strong and oppressive hand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every year for the past eight years, articles have been written that Kosovo is about to explode -- that mass violence and the expulsion of vast numbers of Albanians are approaching -- and that the West has to do something. So far Kosovo has been the dog that has not barked, despite the execrable situation that exists between the province's 1.8 million Albanians and the Belgrade regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Kosovo steadily deteriorates. Serb repression increases, and violence in the province is rising. The Albanians agree that Western intervention is the answer for achieving independence, but more and more they disagree on tactics. The present majority headed by the elected &quot;president,&quot; Ibrahim Rugova, pursues a non-provocation policy. Another, more amorphous school, believes Albanians must be more assertive in publicly demonstrating their opposition to Serbian rule if they are to get more from the West than sermons on nonviolence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most ominous has been the emergence of a little-known militant group called the Kosovo Liberation Front, which believes that violence is the only way to achieve Albanian political aims. The front is apparently well armed and is responsible for a number of recent violent incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody knows when Kosovo will &quot;erupt.&quot; But it is clear that one day that will happen, and that day is drawing closer. The West knows it. Yet Western policy toward Kosovo can be described as hand-wringing -- i.e., rising rhetoric directed at Milosevic and much diplomatic to-ing and fro-ing, all signifying little. Washington's line-in-the-sand message to Belgrade, first by President Bush and repeated by President Clinton, not to use military force in Kosovo came when Serbia had no need to use force. At a time of real breakdown in Kosovo, that admonition may get lost in the sand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic was a key factor in the Dayton agreement, and the United States has focused on Belgrade's role in Bosnia to make Dayton work. All high-level visits have been devoted to getting Milosevic's help with the Bosnian Serbs -- from forging a common automobile license plate in Bosnia to removing indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic from power. The U.S. government believes Milosevic has been helpful to its efforts in Bosnia. As for Serbia, the United States did little to promote democracy, gave mostly ritualistic support to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of November 1996 and failed to beard him on Kosovo. In short, we seem afraid to do anything that might undermine Milosevic's ability to help implement Dayton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who rules in Serbia, and the role of the defense and security forces, is critical to Bosnia. The leadership in Belgrade still can do much to undermine Dayton, although it would face serious penalties. Equally, a major change in Kosovo -- large-scale violence, a massive outflow of Albanians, a change in borders -- could wreck Dayton by its impact on Serbia's leadership, on the Bosnian Serbs and on the region in general. The international management of such a disaster would be enormously difficult and costly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also a longer-term factor here. The Balkans never will be stable if Serbia continues to decline and remains a pariah. Nor can Serbia ever become a democratic country or a normal state until it deals with Kosovo. Serbia's isolation again is generating an economic crisis. The country is close to running out of foreign currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the deep feelings on both sides, the Kosovo conundrum has no easy solution, which is probably another reason why the United States has not gotten involved. Any Serbian leader will have great difficulty finding a solution acceptable to Serbs and making it stick. Albanians, having sacrificed much, can be equally adamant. No solution can be delivered without outside help. Right now Milosevic is the only one in Serbia who might be able to work out some sort of agreement with the Albanians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is needed, nearly everyone agrees, is to start a serious negotiating process between the two parties. That will require the United States -- the only external power the two sides are prepared to accept -- to get deeply involved in generating such talks and participating in them. The parties themselves must be brought to some initial agreement. Almost certainly such an agreement must entail the end of an oppressive Serb regime in Kosovo, Albanian self-rule and no change in borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A negotiation on Kosovo will require massive U.S. diplomatic effort with no assurance of success. That means a serious capability to carry out such a major initiative, a capacity that has yet to be marshaled within the U.S. government. It means overcoming the fear that our getting deeply involved in Kosovo negotiations will make Belgrade more uncooperative in Bosnia. Real progress also requires raising the pressure on Milosevic yet offering tangible benefits to Serbia. The present Serbian economic crunch makes this an opportune time to try.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kosovo threatens our massive investment in Bosnia and stability in the region. We will be courting folly if we continue to act as if Bosnia can be settled without substantial change in Serbia or without sustained U.S. effort in Kosovo. The past 10 years in the Balkans have shown the critical role of the West and the enormous cost of getting there too late.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The arrests of eight foreigners, including two Britons, on charges of espionage are designed to create a &quot;sense of siege&quot; and boost President Slobodan Milosevic's already strong chances in next month's elections, western officials fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They are in effect hostages to his effort to present Yugoslavia as being under threat,&quot; a senior official said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ever since last year's war over Kosovo, western governments have pinned their hopes of removing Mr Milosevic on various scenarios, including an army coup and street demonstrations. When the Yugoslav strongman unexpectedly announced snap elections for next month, they banked on the central campaign issues being the future of the Serbian economy, Serbia's reintegration into the European fold, and how best to achieve political liberalisation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mr Milosevic is casting the election as a loyalty test, with his challengers portrayed as traitors. &quot;This is a battle for the survival of the nation and the state. Slobodan Milosevic is the symbol of Yugoslavia, of heroic resistance to the aggressor, and of restoration and development. Our opponents are not an opposition to our party, but to their own people and the state,&quot; Gorica Gajevic, the secretary general of the Socialist party of Serbia, said last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forced on to the back foot, the fractious Serbian opposition has accepted Mr Milosevic's gameplan and, in choosing Vojislav Kostunica as its standard-bearer in the elections, has appointed a nationalist rather than a liberaliser. As a result, western governments find themselves rooting for a man who strongly criticised Nato's Kosovo campaign and who refuses to meet officials from Nato countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anti-western feeling is still high in Serbia and although many voters criticise Mr Milosevic they seem to accept his argument that Yugoslavia remains under siege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic's maverick ally, the ultra-nationalist Vojislav Seselj, yesterday pursued that line. He attacked Mr Kostunica as &quot;Nato's candidate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Voice of America, Free Europe, Deutsche Welle and the BBC have all praised Kostunica over the past few days in Serbian language broadcasts,&quot; he said. Mr Kostunica had been more cunning than other opposition leaders at hiding his pro-Nato feelings but Serbs would never vote for &quot;Nato candidates&quot;, he went on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charge is ironic since Mr Kostunica's nationalist credentials are clear. Before the Nato air strikes, he was photographed with Serbs in Kosovo brandishing a Kalashnikov rifle in resistance. He has described relations between foreigners and the Serbian state as &quot;a game in which everything is given up in return for almost nothing, except symbolic concessions&quot;. He strongly opposes the Hague tribunal and criticises the war crimes indictment issued against Mr Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This line of &quot;moderate nationalism&quot; may explain why Mr Kostunica came out well in a recent poll by the Belgrade-based Institute of Social Sciences. It found him leading Mr Milosevic by 42% to 28%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the poll was taken before the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a leading opposition party, decided to put up its own candidate in a move which will split the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti- Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> front.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police began clubbing demonstrators again today as more than 50,000 people marched through Belgrade.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The previous day truncheon-wielding riot police set upon a crowd of unarmed protesters, injuring 80 of them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As European countries and the Serbian Orthodox Church denounced the crackdown, Belgrade was tense again today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About 1000 riot police with helmets, shields and tear gas fanned out to prevent a crowd of some 50,000 people assembled in Republic Square from staging a march along the city's main boulevard.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier in the day 30,000 students marched across the bridge that was the scene of yesterday's violence, but this time there were no police on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a press conference, Mr Draskovic said the Yugoslav army had to end its neutral stance in the crisis and intervene on behalf of the protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic and other opposition leaders have appealed for army support several times in the marathon showdown, the worst Mr Milosevic has faced since he came to power 10 years ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DECEPTION: While other hardliners call for a crackdown on demonstrators, Serbia's leader resorts to more subtle methods, like financial pressure, personal smears and the occasional beating of a well-known public figure or two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- For the past eight days, some uninvited guests have been visiting Branislav Gojkovic's popular bookstore, Plato's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dreaded financial police -- inspectors who on a whim can fine a businessman thousands of dollars or shut him down altogether -- arrived soon after Gojkovic lent space and loudspeakers to students for their daily, high-decibel protests against President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since almost all business in Belgrade is conducted under murky circumstances, it seems clear to people here that Gojkovic was singled out not for his bookkeeping but for his support of the opposition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, as students prepared to launch yet another rally outside Plato's, the owner apparently bowed to the pressure and took back his loudspeakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite tough talk from some government officials in favor of an all-out crackdown, Milosevic is pursuing a more insidious campaign to intimidate and discredit opponents who have been marching through city streets for 25 days to demand recognition for elections they won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has opted for: selective arrests and beatings; economic pressures and incentives; a media smear campaign; and the establishment of parallel, &quot;loyal&quot; organizations to detract from those in rebellion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The threat of force is always there, of course -- on Thursday, scores of heavily armed riot police blocked thousands of students who attempted to march to Milosevic's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the intimidation is physical, economic or psychological, a little goes a long way in a country yet to emerge from decades of communism, paranoia and apathy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two high-profile arrests have sent chills through the demonstration ranks. Gojko Baletic, a well-known actor, was seized by police after a rally on Wednesday, beaten unconscious and held incommunicado overnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That arrest followed last weekend's detention and torture of Dejan Bulatovic, a student who had demonstrated with a bigger-than-life effigy of Milosevic wearing prison stripes. Bulatovic, who had to receive emergency medical treatment, was finally allowed to see a lawyer this week but in the presence of prison guards. He whispered that police said they would kill him if he reported all of the brutal treatment to which he had been subjected, lawyer Ivan Sebek said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regime &quot;is choosing people who are very visible,&quot; said Sebek, who is working on behalf of the opposition. &quot;They are choosing people who are the examples to discourage others from joining. That is the message. They are trying to scare people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another method for discrediting the opposition is the use of the state-run media to conduct a smear campaign against the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coalition known as Zajedno.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All television and most radio stations are controlled by Milosevic or his allies, and there are only a handful of independent or pro-opposition newspapers. The pro-Milosevic media has lumped opposition leaders with the most despised of Serbia's enemies, an undisguised effort to push all the right patriotic buttons and to split society along lines of deep loyalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro-government newspapers have especially focused on perceived support of the Zajedno </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Albanian separatists. Albanians form the majority in Serbia's tense Kosovo region, an area that Serb nationalists cherish as the cradle of their civilization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic pressure is applied in different ways. Besides unleashing the revenuers on Gojkovic's bookstore, Milosevic has also played the game from the other end -- by suddenly paying long overdue wages to workers and announcing cuts in electricity rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resorting to a common technique under communism, the regime has also established parallel institutions to undercut those participating in demonstrations. A new &quot;Independent Students Organization&quot; appeared this week, holding news conferences. Posters suddenly appeared saying, &quot;Study, yes! Politics, no!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters who went to the address given by the association as its office found no one there had ever heard of it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist party offered yesterday to hold early elections, one day before an anti-government rally was planned in the capital Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The offer fell far short, however, of opposition demands that Milosevic step down and allow a transitional government before any elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the eve of the Belgrade protest, 20,000 people rallied in the country's third-largest city, Nis, chanting: &quot;Resignations, resignations!&quot; Beta news agency said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that there are more important things on the nation's agenda than the elections but if the opposition wants that, so be it,&quot; Ivica Dacic, a spokesman for the Socialist party, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are ready.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waves of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests began in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, after the 78-day NATO air campaign left the country badly damaged, impoverished, isolated and without control over the southern province Kosovo. The air campaign was launched to force Milosevic to accept a peace plan for the separatist province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar rallies in the capital in 1996-97 pushed the Yugoslav president to make concessions to anti-government activists. Milosevic later took advantage of power struggles among coalition leaders to backpedal on all of the deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition leaders have still been unable to forge a common front against Milosevic. A key opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic, for example, will not attend today's rally. In the past, he has led the biggest protests against Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said officials have met with opposition leaders and have been encouraging them to maintain unity as a means of hastening the departure of Milosevic -- who has been indicted by a UN court for alleged war crimes in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that the people of Serbia and the people of the Balkans would be far, far better off if an indicted war criminal were no longer to be the president of Yugoslavia,&quot; Rubin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that this is a view that is increasingly taking hold in a number of parts of Yugoslav and Serbian society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But yesterday, another prominent opposition leader fled Belgrade for Montenegro, Yugoslavia's rebellious province whose government opposes Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vesna Pesic, an official of the opposition Civic Alliance of Serbia, fled one day after Milosevic's prosecutor demanded an investigation against her for allegedly calling for violent toppling of his regime. She could have faced 20 years in prison if convicted of the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pesic, who was to have addressed the Belgrade rally today, said the prosecutor's statement was designed to intimidate people from attending the gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition has said it wants early elections but only if they are monitored by international observers. Dacic did not indicate the date of the early elections, or whether foreign monitoring would be allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections are technically scheduled for 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A prominent official of the opposition Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milan Bozic, said yesterday his party would agree to early elections but only under international control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic party deputy chairwoman Ljiljana Lucic said the governing coalition's offer of early elections would be just another attempt at vote fraud.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prayers for the souls of thousands of soldiers and civilians killed in the fighting were relayed by loudspeakers to a crowd estimated at around 25,000 gathered outside the chapel of Saint Sava cathedral.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The occasion was the first anniversary of anti-government demonstrations in Belgrade last March when two people died after troops and police opened fire on the crowd and tanks were sent into the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition parties marked the date with a rally demanding the resignation of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, one of the last surviving former Communist leaders in eastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, a charismatic poet who leads the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called for a general strike, but set no date.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lower-than-expected turnout for the rally was blamed by organizers on what they called a campaign of fear waged by the ruling Socialist party.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, YUGOSLAVIA</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Slobodan Milosevic's control over the Yugoslav media crumbled yesterday when the state news agency switched its allegiance and protesters took over state television, plowing into the broadcast headquarters with a bulldozer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bulldozer, apparently commandeered by demonstrators, broke through the walls of the TV building and demonstrators poured inside. Police fled out the back as some state TV employees joined the protesters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like all sane people in Serbia, we don't agree with this lunatic editorial policy,&quot; said Geno Juric, an assistant producer at the state TV operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters said dozens of police at the state TV building joined crowds taking control there. Flames spilled from the first floor, burning part of the structure that had been one of Milosevic's propaganda mainstays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state Tanjug news agency -- another pillar of Milosevic's rule -- also announced it was changing sides and referred to Milosevic's rival, Vojislav Kostunica, as the &quot;president-elect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition claims Kostunica won Sept. 24 presidential elections outright, and yesterday's massive Belgrade protests were sparked by Milosevic's attempts to cling to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From this moment, Tanjug informs the Yugoslav public that it is with the people of this country and that it will report entirely on the basis of professional standards, truthfully and objectively,&quot; said a brief statement signed Journalists of the Free Tanjug and carried by the agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement was only the latest sign that Milosevic had lost control of his crucial state media apparatus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier yesterday, more than 160 state television employees were fired for going on strike. Employees of the state newspaper Politika demanded that editorial policies be changed to include reports about the opposition, and several local branches of the official television stopped broadcasting programs from the Belgrade headquarters, opting for their own instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fired state TV employees, mostly technical staff and editors of economic and culture programs, walked off to demand more objective reporting and the removal of managers and editors loyal to Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We demand that the editors and journalists ... who are still taking part in the biased reporting, to refuse obedience ... and join their colleagues who have already distanced themselves from such policies,&quot; some of the state television staff said in a letter carried by Beta news agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State television is the only TV broadcast seen throughout all of Serbia, and firm control over the broadcast and over several newspapers had been a main pillar of Milosevic's rule since 1987. Aware of television's importance for Milosevic, NATO bombed the TV headquarters in downtown Belgrade during last year's air war against Yugoslavia, killing 16 employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because most people associate the state media with Milosevic, media outlets had become a symbol of his autocratic rule and probably the state institution most hated by the pro-democracy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During major </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests four years ago, the state television and Politika buildings were pelted with eggs and stones by furious demonstrators. For months, Serbs banged pots from balconies to drown out the sound of the main evening newscast.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YUGOSLAVIA'S leaders pulled back from the brink yesterday and agreed to resume negotiations to find a way out of the crisis threatening to tear the country apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the tensest two weeks in the country's post-war history bringing army tanks, riot police, and tens of thousands of anti-communist protesters on to the streets of Belgrade and raising the spectre of a military takeover the presidents of the federation's six republics agreed to discuss the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A meeting on Thursday evening of the collective federal presidency the six republican presidents and the federal Prime Minister, Ante Markovic also discussed how to keep the economy functioning until the bickering republics decide on their relations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was much talk, following the meeting, of rift-healing and tolerance. But despite the conciliatory signals, tension remains high, particularly in Serbia, the biggest republic under the diminishing control of its authoritarian President, Slobodan Milosevic, and his Socialist Party of former communists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this volatile climate, a week is a long time. Observers do not rule out a resumption of hostilities that could derail the dialogue. Thursday's meeting took place because Mr Milosevic went back on his dramatic statement last weekend declaring the collective federal presidency illegitimate, after he failed three times to get it to authorise a military crackdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thwarted in his attempts to control the presidency, he then had to bow to its reconstitution. The Serbian parliament, dominated by Milosevic supporters, rejected the resignation of the Milosevic aide, Borisav Jovic, from the presidency, enabling him to retake his seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the battering that the federal presidency has taken in the past week suggests that it will play a reduced role in the negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democratic League of Kosovo, the party supported by the vast majority of ethnic Albanians in the Serb-controlled southern province of Kosovo and arguably the biggest opposition party in Serbia, punctured the talk of reconciliation yesterday by demanding a voice at the negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said talk of democratic bargaining over the future of Yugoslavia would remain meaningless as long as the country's third biggest ethnic group, the Albanians, were excluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is inconceivable at present that Mr Milosevic would assent to allowing representative Albanian participation in the talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Belgrade, meanwhile, dissidence is rumbling again amid signs that Mr Milosevic is going back on concessions he has been forced to make over the past 10 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Serbian leader appears to be playing for time. While the Serbian interior minister, Radmilo Bogdanovic, offered to resign last week under pressure from the student protests, his resignation has not yet been accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite concessions on media control such as the sacking of the director of Belgrade radio and television the widespread view is that the changes are cosmetic and that mainstream television and newspapers in Serbia continue to peddle pro-Milosevic propaganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement yesterday, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Vuk Draskovic, Mr Milosevic's biggest rival, claimed that the Serbian police were waging a campaign of 'coercion, threats and interrogation' against those who took part in the demonstrations that erupted in Belgrade two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic has called for further </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests next Wednesday, while student activists are busy in the centre of the city collecting thousands of signatures for a petition aimed at keeping up the pressure on Mr Milosevic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SVETI STEFAN, Yugoslavia -- After leading his nation to four humiliating<BR>battlefield losses. After wrecking a once-prosperous economy.<BR>And after turning a proud people into the isolated pariahs of<BR>modern Europe.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Slobodan Milosevic may be gone.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tumultuous day of protest capping a roller-coaster political<BR>drama ended late Thursday with Yugoslavia's state-run media announcing<BR>that it was with &quot;the people&quot; and proclaiming opposition leader<BR>Vojislav Kostunica the country's elected president.<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no official word on the whereabouts of Milosevic and<BR>his powerful wife, Mira. And the possibility that the autocrat<BR>was marshaling whatever forces remained loyal to him could not<BR>be discounted.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for the hundreds of thousands of people jamming the streets<BR>of the capital, Belgrade, and promising to stay there through<BR>the night, there was only a volcano of emotion, a euphoria that<BR>sprang from more than a decade of suffering.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was living for this day,&quot; said a delirious Jovice Miric,<BR>35, an auto mechanic in the Belgrade crowd that, with little official<BR>resistance, took over the Parliament and the headquarters of the<BR>state-run TV and radio stations. &quot;I was prepared to give everything,<BR>to give my life, to see Milosevic go.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a day that many in the battered remnant of the former Yugoslavia<BR>had feared would never come.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if, as dawn approached, Milosevic's political demise was not<BR>assured, some warned that a very different vision also could not<BR>be ruled out: the example of a hated Serbian king and his equally<BR>unpopular queen, who were killed in a coup in 1903, their bodies<BR>thrown from the palace window and mutilated.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the Cold War's non-aligned jewel of Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia<BR>was a country that embraced six republics, reaching from the Hungarian<BR>border in the north to Albania's &quot;Cursed Mountains&quot; in the south.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, it comprises just impoverished Serbia, where the average<BR>monthly salary is just $ 48, and tiny Montenegro.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic was far from solely responsible for the agony of Yugoslavia,<BR>which began in 1991. Short-sighted politicians in the other republics,<BR>who pursued romantic 19th century ideas of nationalism at the<BR>expense of peace and prosperity, were his co-conspirators.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he was, and is, the man who personified the continuing Balkan<BR>crisis.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more than a decade, Milosevic was the &quot;Zelig&quot; of Europe's<BR>worst trauma since the end of the Second World War, figuring in<BR>every stage of the endless Balkans drama. Seen first as the pyromaniac<BR>let loose in the Balkan tinderbox, by the time of the Dayton Agreement<BR>ending the war in Bosnia in 1995, he appeared -- especially to<BR>American policymakers -- as the region's indispensable peacemaker.<BR>That portrait, if it was ever accurate, was thoroughly discredited<BR>by the crisis and subsequent war over the separatist Serbian province<BR>of Kosovo.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This day of apparent triumph, of course, came much too late for<BR>the victims of almost a decade of Milosevic-inspired bloodletting.<BR>Graves in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo are filled with the casualties<BR>of the effort to replace the original Yugoslavia with a ring of<BR>ethnically pure nation-states.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the largest single massacre, more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim<BR>men were slaughtered at Srebrenica in July 1995. In the most geopolitically<BR>potent, 45 people were shot down in the Kosovo village of Racak<BR>in January 1999, killings that led directly to NATO's decision<BR>to go to war over the rebel province.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, Serbs, too, were victims of Milosevic's ill-conceived policies.<BR>After his plan for a &quot;Greater Serbia&quot; collapsed, tens of thousands<BR>of his ethnic kin were forced to flee lands in Croatia's Krajina<BR>region, where Serbs had lived for centuries.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly 100,000 other Serbs today live penned in NATO-patrolled<BR>enclaves in Kosovo, surrounded by vengeance-minded Albanians and<BR>abandoned by their president after a futile 78-day war with the<BR>largest military alliance in the world.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbs in Serbia itself, heirs to one of Europe's proudest<BR>traditions of independence and valor, once lived in the most prosperous<BR>country in Eastern Europe. Now Milosevic's successors are expected<BR>to need two decades just to recover Serbia's 1989 standard of<BR>living.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy to forget, amid the seemingly unanimous popular condemnation<BR>of Milosevic, how popular he once was. In the late 1980s, as communism<BR>collapsed across Europe, Milosevic embraced a full-throated nationalism<BR>that was in sync with a broad segment of Serbian society. By the<BR>time the Berlin Wall fell, popular ditties celebrated his virtues:<BR>&quot;Slobodan, they call you freedom/You are loved by big and small.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His popularity soon waned. In 1991, he crushed an anti-war revolt<BR>with tanks. Six years later, he compromised an unsteady opposition<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called Zajedno (&quot;Together&quot;) with partial concessions<BR>and financial blandishments.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For much of his career, he was blessed with the right enemies.<BR>His domestic opponents were a chronically quarrelsome bunch lacking<BR>political savvy. Easy to smear as lackeys of foreign conspirators,<BR>they seemed to prefer to hang separately rather than hang together.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic also notably enjoyed power thanks to the ballot -- not<BR>the bullet. Elections in Yugoslavia and Serbia were rarely models<BR>of Western democracy, but his parliamentary majorities depended<BR>upon coalition partners, who could have backed other leaders,<BR>and the ideological blindness of other potentially powerful opponents.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the separatist ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, for example, had<BR>swallowed their ideological objections and voted in Serbian elections<BR>rather than boycotted them, Milosevic could have been peaceably<BR>removed from power years ago. But the Albanians didn't, and they<BR>later paid the price.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never shy about using power, he was at the same time remarkably<BR>sensitive to the appearance (if not the reality) of legality.<BR>His government employed violence against those who disagreed with<BR>it.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Milosevic was not a totalitarian and, despite the jibes of<BR>editorial writers and politicians, not a dictator in the mold<BR>of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His secret police had 150,000 listening devices to monitor the<BR>telephone conversations of opponents, according to an August report<BR>of the Brussels-based International Crisis Group. Yet, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">figures in Belgrade also were free to speak with foreign journalists,<BR>who could quote them by name.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His was, after all, an odd government for late 20th and early<BR>21st century Europe. The economy was largely state-controlled,<BR>the official media produced a torrent of transparent propaganda,<BR>and corruption was endemic.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until Thursday, the question was: How long could this go on?<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, it seems, we know.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic may be succeeded by a man few would ever have suggested<BR>for the role.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former law professor who emerged as the presidential candidate<BR>of a united opposition only two months ago, Kostunica made an<BR>unprecedented lengthy and unedited appearance on state-run television<BR>Thursday night.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official TV is now controlled by his coalition, and Kostunica,<BR>speaking from the capital in his customary phlegmy baritone, used<BR>the opportunity to introduce himself to a wider national audience.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All those years, our life, day after day, hour after hour, was<BR>too exciting. People now want some peace, and that's what I felt<BR>during the campaign. That's what I saw in the eyes,&quot; he said.<BR>&quot;This vision of Serbia is going to get realized now. Democracy<BR>is a healer. Tomorrow, this television will be open for those<BR>who represent quite different attitudes. I promise that every<BR>other voice in Serbia will be heard.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Serbs and their neighbors, for Europe and the United States,<BR>it appears that a new era lies ahead. It could start as soon as<BR>today, when the opposition plans to convene the first parliamentary<BR>session of the new Serbia.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The end of Milosevic would not mean the end of his country's troubles.<BR>The economy is in ruins, the political culture has been debased,<BR>and the country has yet to come to terms with its role in the<BR>past decade of Balkans violence and hatred.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Thursday was a good start.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE - On this 29th day of NATO's war against Yugoslavia it might be worthwhile to look at what the current situation is like on the ground throughout the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forced departure of the ethnic-Albanian community from Kosovo appears to be in its final stage. In the absence of reliable census figures, it is impossible for anyone to produce pre-war statistics for Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, popular opinion puts the population at two million, of which 10 per cent were alleged to be Serbs. Informed sources suggest that the overall figure was significantly less, but we will probably only know for sure when we count the number of refugees expelled from Kosovo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the past year approximately one million Albanians have been forced or convinced to leave the province, which means there are somewhere around 300,000 to 400,000 left and a significant number of them are moving in the direction of Kosovo's borders with Macedonia and Albania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The air campaign and Milosevic's reaction to it have without doubt accelerated the removal of the Albanian population. This fact combined with Yugoslavia's paranoia regarding a NATO land invasion and the desire of the Serb army to clear all civilians from Kosovo in order to enhance what they see as an inevitable defensive battle does not auger well for any Albanians remaining in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billions of dollars worth of damage has been sustained by Yugoslavia infrastructure and military complexes. Oil refineries have been put out of commission and fuel supplies stored in the open are targeted on a daily basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of bridges over the Danube are destroyed, the three in Belgrade being the exception. Electronic communications facilities of all types have been severely degraded and few transmission towers are left standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as civilian casualties are concerned, ''only'' 1,000 people have been killed or injured by the bombing campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yugoslav army has suffered considerable damage in Kosovo but considering the dearth of information from that area it is impossible to gauge how much its operational effectiveness has been reduced. Considering the number of caves, tunnels and bunkers located in Kosovo, it is probably a safe deduction that the army is still an effective and formidable fighting force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in neighbouring Macedonia is highly unstable due to the massive influx of Albanian refugees. Macedonia's political situation is precarious at the best of times considering its ethnic mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presence of hundreds of thousands of refugees combined with Macedonia's 25-per-cent Albanian population is seen as a considerable threat by most of the remaining citizens. The build-up of NATO forces numbering at least 12,000 is seen as an additional threat because of the potential for cross-border operations into Macedonia by Serb forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albania, the poorest country in the region and only just recovering from a period of anarchy, is under immense pressure from its considerable share of the refugee exodus. Cross-border operations in remote border regions are commonplace and NATO's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of approximately 8,000 troops into the area along with Apache helicopters and multiple rocket launchers increase the potential for such attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In ''neutral'' Montenegro there is much anticipation of a coup by the Yugoslavian army to displace a pro-western, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government. Many Montenegrans are confused and upset they are included on NATO's target lists. In spite of the fact that mostly military targets have been struck, many feel the attacks are unjustified and unfair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as Milosevic is concerned, there are no evident cracks in his intransigence to date. Diplomatic delegations parade through his office on a daily basis but there have been no hints of even a minor breakthrough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Successful diplomacy is a secretive process and the public will not be aware of any progress on that front until there is a major development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news is that there appears to be an increased level of activities by senior Yugoslav officials. They seem to be preoccupied with what I can only assume are numerous diplomatic initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's hope one of them works.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violent clashes between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic loyalists and supporters of the democratic Serb opposition were narrowly averted last night when the ruling Serb Socialist Party apparently lost its nerve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party bosses had scheduled a demonstration at the same time and place as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opposition. Many expected violence -- one man was killed on the last occasion of such a deliberate double-booking.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday however, the Socialists backed down in the face of growing anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They started to erect a stage for their rival meeting yesterday afternoon. But the hostility of the crowd was so strong that they finally gave up and left the pieces lying uselessly on the ground just a few metres from the stage that the opposition successfully erected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the demonstration, a local Socialist Party boss, Ratko Zecevic, fired gun shots from his office balcony, causing brief panic among the thousands who had gathered in the central square. However, the meeting went off peacefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic supporters unfurled a banner from a balcony demanding &quot;Traitors Leave Toplica&quot; (the region surrounding Prokuplje) but they were booed off the balcony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the usually self-confident Milosevic supporters who seemed frightened. An old man inside the locked Socialist Party headquarters told The Independent that the demonstration was &quot;absolute barbarism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were scuffles between supporters and opponents of the regime, but there were no injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoran Djindjic, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, received a much warmer welcome in Prokuplje than he had at the hands of the Kosovo Serbs in Gracanica earlier in the day. He called for a peaceful solution to Serbia's problems, saying, &quot;There are not so many Serbs that we can fight and kill each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All over the country, signs of resistance are multiplying -- though the protests have not yet reached critical mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEMANDS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resistance to the regime is taking different forms. In the industrial town of Nis down the road from Prokuplje, people lined up at trestle tables to sign demands for Milosevic's resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign is organized under the slogan, Many reasons -- but one demand: Resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each signatory gives not just their name but address and ID number. These serve to show not just that the signatories are real, but also that people are not afraid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the planned signing points in Nis were dismantled after the police threatened arrests. But outside a shopping mall in the city centre, organizers stayed put, daring the police to do their worst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other towns, the gathering of signatures was banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic's Serb Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO) -- formerly a pillar of the opposition -- has hesitated between supporting the protests and remaining loyal to Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic has conspicuously avoided calling for the resignation of the Yugoslav leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skepticism of politicians of all stripes runs deep in Serbia today. And tension remains high in the only other remaining Yugoslav republic, Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pro-western Montenegrin government fears proposals by Belgrade to form a federal police force, which could overrule Montenegro's own force. The Montenegrin interior ministry said such preparations were &quot;yet another bid to destabilize the general situation in the republic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the NATO bombing, government buildings in the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica, were protected by armed police against a threatened coup by army units loyal to Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgrade was publicly furious at Montenegro's refusal to offer support to Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serb media are split in their reporting of the current situation. The independent tabloid Blic devoted most of yesterday's front page to news about the opposition protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pro-government Politika by contrast remained silent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western officials fear that the arrests of eight foreigners, including two Canadians, on charges of espionage are designed to create a &quot;sense of siege&quot; and boost President Slobodan Milosevic's already strong chances in next month's elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are, in effect, hostages to his effort to present Yugoslavia as being under threat,&quot; a senior official said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever since last year's war over Kosovo, western governments have pinned their hopes of removing Milosevic on various scenarios, including an army coup and street demonstrations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Yugoslav strongman unexpectedly announced snap elections for next month, they banked on the central campaign issues being the future of the Serbian economy, Serbia's reintegration into the European fold, and how best to achieve political liberalization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Milosevic is casting the election as a loyalty test, with his challengers portrayed as traitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a battle for the survival of the nation and the state. Slobodan Milosevic is the symbol of Yugoslavia, of heroic resistance to the aggressor, and of restoration and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our opponents are not an opposition to our party, but to their own people and the state,&quot; Gorica Gajevic, the secretary general of the Socialist party of Serbia said last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forced on to the defensive, the fractious Serbian opposition has accepted Milosevic's game plan and, in choosing Vojislav Kostunica as its standard-bearer in the elections, has appointed a nationalist rather than a liberalizer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, western governments find themselves rooting for a man who strongly criticized NATO's Kosovo campaign and who refuses to meet officials from NATO countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-western feeling is still high in Serbia and although many voters criticize Milosevic they seem to accept his argument that Yugoslavia remains under siege. Milosevic's ally, the ultra-nationalist Vojislav Seselj, yesterday pursued that line. He attacked Kostunica as &quot;NATO's candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On radio, Voice of America, Free Europe, Deutsche Welle and the BBC have all praised Kostunica over the past few days in Serbian language broadcasts,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica had been more cunning than other opposition leaders at hiding his pro-NATO feelings but Serbs would never vote for &quot;NATO candidates,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge is ironic since Kostunica's nationalist credentials are clear. Before the NATO air strikes, he was photographed with Serbs in Kosovo brandishing a Kalashnikov rifle in resistance. He has described relations between foreigners and the Serbian state as &quot;a game in which everything is given up in return for almost nothing, except symbolic concessions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He strongly opposes the Hague Tribunal and criticizes the war crimes indictment issued against Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This line of &quot;moderate nationalism&quot; may explain why Kostunica came out well in a recent poll by the Belgrade-based Institute of Social Sciences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It found him leading Milosevic by 42 per cent to 28 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the poll was taken before the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a leading opposition party, decided to put up its own candidate in a move which will split the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> front.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jelena Kovacevic, 25 years old, wants change so badly she is nearly in tears. She's afraid of the winter, afraid of her grandparents dying from lack of medicine, afraid of the future, afraid that she will never live in a Serbia in which she will want to bear a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A painter and graphic artist, she goes nightly to the opposition demonstrations in Novi Sad seeking the ouster of President Slobodan Milosevic, but she does not believe that they will succeed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I go to the rallies because I want something good to happen in this country, so I can't stay at home,&quot; she said, twisting her fingers around her three earrings. &quot;But I don't go because I support the opposition, either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are so tired, tired of everything,&quot; she said. &quot;Normally, I'm a person with a lot of energy, but I don't feel it now. I don't see the person in the opposition who can lead the Serbs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Kovacevic's despair is widely shared among the tens of thousands, young and old, who have turned out for Serbia's first week of rallies to try to oust the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a despair shared, privately, by opposition officials and organizers, who are trying to swallow down their disappointment in their own people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As many as 80,000 people across Serbia turned out last Tuesday, but the numbers since have, if anything, been shrinking. While the enthusiasm is palpable in Novi Sad, a 90-minute drive north of Belgrade, and numbers are back up to 30,000 in the capital now that demonstrators are asked to march instead of simply listen to speeches, they are down in other Serbian cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country of nearly 11 million people, the turnout is not even close to a politically definitive figure, let alone to the two million demonstrators that the Democratic Party leader, Zoran Djindjic, believes will be necessary to get the Milosevic Government to crack. And the behavior of the protesters is extraordinarily -- and undramatically -- polite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like Don Quixote against the windmills,&quot; said Vesna, who asked that her last name not be used because she works for an international organization. &quot;However much we'd like to see Milosevic fall, to see him hanging with his wife from a lamppost in Terazije Square, like Mussolini, on the other hand&quot; -- she paused, lifting up her arms, turning her palms toward her face -- &quot;the power is still in his hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People are tired and afraid of losing what little is left to them, including their jobs, Vesna said. &quot;From the end of the war until now, energy has been dissipated by the war, the bombing, the shortages of everything,&quot; she said. &quot;And the opposition dissipates energy, too, with empty rallies, with their squabbling and their fight for supremacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indisputable fact about the opposition is its division: Mr. Djindjic and the Alliance for Change, a coalition of smaller parties, have taken a path of daily rallies opposed by the largest, notionally opposition party, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Vuk Draskovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic and Mr. Djindjic, former allies in the Zajedno or Together coalition that led 88 days of opposition demonstrations in the winter of 1996-97, not so casually despise each other. Mr. Draskovic, who now controls Belgrade and its television station, Studio B, says that the Alliance strategy is all wrong, that street pressure will not bring down Mr. Milosevic but should be used to demand fair and early elections, even if Mr. Milosevic keeps his seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democratic Party officials and many rally goers believe that Mr. Draskovic simply wants to destroy Mr. Djindjic and become the sole leader of the opposition, and that his position is part of a deal with Mr. Milosevic to keep each other in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vesna believes that Mr. Draskovic is hopelessly compromised by his desire to keep Belgrade, its money and privilege, and that he cannot be considered a member of the opposition at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It really is true that the revolution eats its own children,&quot; she said. &quot;Draskovic chooses not to join these rallies, and he is doing all he can to kill them.&quot; Studio B has taken a dismissive line toward the rallies, reporting them but underestimating turnout, much as state television has been doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vuk is a red bandit now,&quot; said Jovan Bandin, using a description commonly attached to Mr. Milosevic and his allies. Mr. Bandin, a portly, bearded businessman who says he will attend rallies until the end, said he liked Mr. Draskovic three years ago, &quot;but he's Slobo's man now; he's doing everything he can to stop real change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bandin, who imports Timex watches and Herbalife, a nutritional supplement, says: &quot;I have a house and cars. I don't need anything. But what I need I don't have, and that's freedom -- the freedom to live and travel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Bandin is also highly critical of the West's effort to drive Mr. Milosevic into a corner by indicting him for war crimes, giving him no option but to turn and fight for his position. &quot;Without an exit, he won't go,&quot; he said, &quot;not without a real battle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mina, 21, an economics student, has gone to the rallies without much real hope. Asked why, she said bitterly: &quot;Milosevic has smashed my hopes. But the largest blame for that belongs to the opposition parties. They have no clear line. They just wait to see what Milosevic will give them, and everyone knows it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she conceded that the opposition has real problems of finances and lack of media access, too. For instance, cardboard masks of Mr. Milosevic's face with a red line through it, so popular at the first rally, had disappeared by the second day. The Alliance had money to print only 12,000, and they were gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Mr. Draskovic's Studio B essentially unsympathetic to the rallies, it is difficult for Mr. Djindjic to answer the carefully honed criticisms of the state television that has been the mainstay of Mr. Milosevic's 12-year rule of Yugoslavia. Like all good propaganda, reports over the state news media play on real issues: there was a war here, NATO did bomb and take over Kosovo, and ordinary civilians died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within days of the start of the bombing, in March, Mr. Djindjic told The New York Times that the democratic opposition would be the first victim of NATO's war against Mr. Milosevic. And it remains very awkward for the political opposition to push for Western reforms and the ouster of Mr. Milosevic with the apparent support -- moral and financial -- of those who bombed for the same purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, opposition officials say, NATO not only failed to finish off Mr. Milosevic, but also failed to protect the multiethnic character of Kosovo. By letting even innocent Serbs be driven from a province that remains a sovereign part of Yugoslavia, NATO has allowed Mr. Milosevic to justify fighting the war, however unwinnable, by stressing its consequences for Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Kovacevic, the Novi Sad artist, sees the opposition as part of the &quot;collateral damage&quot; of the NATO bombing war, caught between patriotism and its desire to push for Western-style democratic change. She has done a series of &quot;collateral art&quot; and distributed it on her web page (http://www.surf.to/jelena), including a graphic of Sisyphus, eternally trying to climb his mountain with a huge red Communist star still embedded in his back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The opposition had its chance to do something and failed everyone,&quot; she said. &quot;And now, when it's the last chance to do something, when Milosevic is weaker, they're quarreling among themselves. You know people are afraid when they start to quarrel,&quot; she said. &quot;People lose their faith and trust in them, and that's why the demonstrations have lost strength.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Kovacevic is trying without much success to pull money together to attend art school in America, but she also feels guilty about wanting to leave her family and friends before a winter that everyone knows will be difficult, with shortages of electricity and heat. But she doubts that winter will be a great ally to the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It just adds to this collective depression,&quot; she said. &quot;Imagine people in New York without enough electricity and heat, without confidence in the future, without knowing what will happen tomorrow to basic parts of life. Will there be medicine? Will my computer be dead without electricity? This uncertainty translates into apathy, not action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was 6 years old when Tito died in May 1980 after 35 years as the unquestioned leader of the old Communist Yugoslavia. &quot;Everyone cried and I couldn't understand it,&quot; she said. &quot;But since then I've lived in so many states, in so many Yugoslavias, each one smaller than the last, but for 10 years with the same leader -- that's the worst thing of all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of her friends have joined the great exodus of young people from Yugoslavia, to live and work abroad. &quot;They call or E-mail me and ask how am I,&quot; she said. &quot;I can't answer -- things just get worse and worse. And when they talk about visiting, I tell them not to come.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Kovacevic toyed with her earrings again, finished a coffee and prepared to wander out to another rally. &quot;After the war, I really thought Milosevic would be gone in a few days,&quot; she said. &quot;But now he seems stronger.&quot;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbia's political opposition urged the United States today to ease economic sanctions against Yugoslavia, warning that such measures as an embargo on heating oil are harming ordinary citizens and helping to entrench President Slobodan Milosevic in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appeal, delivered during two days of meetings in Budapest with U.S. special Balkans envoy James Dobbins, sought to persuade the United States that Western sanctions are allowing Milosevic to blame the outside world for the hardships faced by the 10 million people of Serbia--Yugoslavia's dominant republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France, Germany and other European Union countries support the idea of removing a ban on commercial air travel to and from Yugoslavia and restoring shipments of food, medical and fuel there--provided that &quot;targeted sanctions&quot; aimed at Milosevic and his associates are sustained. The number of people linked to the Yugoslav ruling clique who have been declared ineligible for visas to nearly all Western nations may soon be doubled to more than 600, increasing the pressure on those closest to Milosevic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Clinton administration has refused to go along with any softening of the sanctions. U.S. officials say they are convinced, given the personal rivalries among Serbian opposition leaders, that the only hope of ousting Milosevic may lie in a massive popular uprising caused by severe deprivation this winter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't really understand why the Americans are so insistent on these sanctions,&quot; said Milan Protic, a leader in the opposition bloc known as Alliance for Change. &quot;There is a serious danger they will backfire by making it a lot easier for Milosevic to stay in power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbian opposition groups want the immediate resumption of commercial air travel connections to Belgrade and basic humanitarian aid, especially fuel oil. They say unless people here receive urgent relief, Milosevic will continue to stir up public resentment against the West--especially now that Russia, despite its own economic difficulties, has started natural gas deliveries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The consistent position of all the opposition of Yugoslavia is that the sanctions really are not removing Milosevic,&quot; said Milan Panic, a former Yugoslav prime minister. &quot;The humanitarian suffering of people cannot ever justify economic sanctions--Milosevic must be removed by some other means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panic said Yugoslavia also needs &quot;massive assistance&quot; to rebuild bridges across the Danube River that were destroyed last spring by a NATO bombing campaign aimed at forcing the Serb-led Yugoslav government to end a violent military campaign against the ethnic Albanian majority of Serbia's Kosovo province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbian Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic, who has been staging nightly protest marches with the ostensible goal of forcing Milosevic to step down, said the time had come for a major change in Western strategy. He proposed that the West offer to lift sanctions as soon as free and fair elections are held in Yugoslavia, regardless of the winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all think this is now the right way to go,&quot; Djindjic said. &quot;The opposition alliance is united behind this idea, and so are the major European allies. Only the United States is against it, because the Americans seem to think lifting sanctions would send the wrong message to Milosevic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic is locked in a power struggle with Vuk Draskovic, the mercurial head of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for leadership of the opposition drive to bring down Milosevic. Draskovic has refused to join the protest rallies and declined to meet even separately with U.S. envoy Dobbins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both opposition leaders, however, insist that sanctions are hurting the cause of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> effort and have expressed exasperation with the United States for its refusal to ease the economic punishment being inflicted on the population at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They argue that such steps are necessary to vindicate contacts with the West at a time when Milosevic is branding them traitors. In a recent speech, Milosevic railed against his rivals as those who &quot;take their marching orders from NATO and are trying to finish the damage started by NATO bombs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slobodan Milosevic faces war crimes charges tomorrow, but the scars of his brutal regime are still raw. Here three Times correspondents recall their own experiences of his wars</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I owe my life to Milosevic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is strange to think that I may owe my life to Slobodan Milosevic, a man more usually renowned as butcher than benefactor. The indicted war criminal, now awaiting judgment day in The Hague, intervened to ensure that his troops looked after me when I found myself on the wrong side of a Nato bombing raid during the Kosovo conflict. But the Yugoslav President was acting out of self-interest, not altruism; he wanted to ensure that I and four other western journalists lived to tell how we came under fire from our own side and how our driver was killed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milosevic overruled a Yugoslav army officer who wanted to order us out of the relative safety of an army camp where we were taken during a lull in the bombing. Had we been forced to go, we would have faced an all-night aerial bombardment on a mountain also thick with snipers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Goran Zdravkovic, the army doctor who helped me on that Sunday afternoon on May 30, 1999, later told me that his commanding officer had not wanted to help people from &quot;aggressor&quot; nations. Elsa Marujo, a TV reporter from Portugal, and I both had cut legs and had been badly shaken by the relentless bombing and the death of our driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You were not fit to leave our camp,&quot; Zdravkovic told me after I met him again by chance in Belgrade two weeks after the Nato campaign ended. &quot;I was having an argument with the commanding officer, who wanted you all sent back down the mountain, when the message came through. Milosevic personally radioed our camp and gave orders for us to look after you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It seemed yet another example of the Yugoslav leader's far-reaching power, especially in the final years of his presidency. Like him or loathe him, few Serbs felt indifferent about him and his regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until his overthrow last October, most Serbs lived in a state of anything from wariness to outright fear. Tension became especially palpable in the 16 months between the end of the Nato bombing campaign and last October's popular uprising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A wave of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies across Serbia in the summer and autumn of 1999 brought an upsurge in the number of armed police on the streets. While their presence roused many to indignation and anger, others were reduced to near panic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few people outside the opposition parties and groups would speak frankly unless sure that they were not overheard. I was once rebuffed by a Serb diplomat for moving to shake his hand in the street at a time when I was unpopular with the regime for having written something critical of the leadership. I had known the diplomat for years and he had often kissed my cheeks in typical Balkan fashion; I presumed that this time he was edgy about being seen to be too friendly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A rise in politically motivated killings and disappearances also gave Belgrade a gangster-ridden feel during the death-throes of the old regime. Milosevic's old mentor, the former Yugoslav leader Ivan Stambolic, was kidnapped last summer and is believed to be dead; Vuk Draskovic, the founder of the opposition Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was involved in a road accident that is being investigated as a possible assassination attempt; and the paramilitary leader Arkan was gunned down by a hit squad in the capital's Inter-Continental Hotel early last year. The sound of gunfire became more than an isolated incident in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Milosevic had supporters, especially outside Belgrade and among the working classes and the older generation, who saw communism as an antidote to the fascism of the Second World War. Rigidly state-controlled propaganda, and prices, were effective, while the Nato bombing rallied Serbs round their Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final days of the Alliance campaign to force Milosevic's forces out of Kosovo were marked by especially fierce fighting on the ground and in the air. The narrow road where we were bombed was one of the last routes open to Serb forces moving between the front line along the Albanian border and the Kosovo capital, Pristina. Two Nato jets swooped out of the sky and pounded the road with five bombs for half an hour. One of the two cars in which we had been travelling was smashed into the roof of a road tunnel by the force of the first blast, killing the driver. The rest of us -an Italian, three Portuguese and I -were on foot near by and escaped with cuts and bruises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the bombing was still under way we could see no way to escape from the area, which was bordered by rock faces, a ravine and the newly bombed road, until the army doctor and a Serb soldier in two battered Yugo cars arrived to help us to their mountain camp. We were given food and medicine, and beds and army jackets as night fell. The next day the soldiers risked KLA sniper attacks to escort us to Pristina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I wondered why these Yugoslav army troops should have been at such pains to help representatives of nations that were fighting them. Our propaganda value became clear when we were back in the Kosovo capital. News of western journalists caught in a bombing raid had flashed across the world. Nato had initially denied that it had taken action in that area, so the implication was that we may have been hit by Serbian shells. The Serbian press seized the chance to broadcast our own accounts of what had happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have since become friends with the conscripted doctor and his family. Zdravkovic is a civilian again, working in a Belgrade hospital, while Milosevic ponders his new surroundings. The former President may be wondering if any miracle will come to his aid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The script at Chateau Rambouillet, ultimately agreed on by the United States, its European NATO allies and Russia, is simple enough:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yugoslavia - that is, Slobodan Milosevic and his Serbian government - will agree to have NATO troops stationed in Kosovo for three years. At the end, the Kosovars will regain limited autonomy, and the Kosovars will disarm and recognize the territorial integrity of Serbia, i.e. renounce their aspirations of independence, or unification with Albania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this script works, there will be universal happiness. Milosevic will keep his power and, as was contemptibly agreed at Rambouillet, nobody will be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. The ethnic Albanians in Macedonia will get the message to keep quiet and not disturb yet another area of the Balkans. NATO troops will manage to do what the unarmed observers could not do - prevent the Serbian atrocities in Kosovo. And after three years, the political settlement will make the Serbs, the Montenegrins, and the Kosovars live happily ever after in the new Yugoslavia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This idyllic scenario makes a lot of theoretical sense. Political solutions are vastly preferable to the use of force. Kosovo is not a viable economic entity on its own. The NATO presence in Kosovo may embolden the democratic opposition to Milosevic and, maybe, lead to the overthrow of him, his orthodox Marxist wife and her advisers, who unseated the members of Milosevic's own marginally less hard-line circle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a dangling carrot at the end of the long road. Ultimately, Yugoslavia will become a part of the unified Europe. After all, Slovenia, a constituent republic of the former Yugoslavia, is among the group of several European countries slated for membership in the European Union in the next round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latter stages of the Rambouillet negotiations, the United States fully embraced this wishful political scenario. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told us that if the Kosovars fail to agree, nothing will be done. The president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, told us on the &quot;Newshour&quot; with Jim Lehrer on Feb. 23 that &quot;peacemaking is not for those who are in it only for a short run.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this is not how the Rambouillet negotiations started. Their original purpose was to force Milosevic to stop the atrocities in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be remembered that for a few weeks prior to Rambouillet, the foreign policy establishment in the United States and in Europe started branding Milosevic as a villain, rather than as a partner in crisis management. Some commentators likened him to Saddam Hussein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this comparison was obvious with respect to war crimes in Bosnia and crimes against humanity in both Bosnia and Kosovo, it otherwise ignored the differences in the peculiar contexts of Iraq and the Balkans and, in particular, the fact that there has been opposition to Milosevic in Serbia, while there is no discernible alternative to Saddam's regime in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any event, the emergence of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sentiment seemed to signal the willingness of NATO members to move against Milosevic and his regime rather than to try to make yet another deal. In other words, one might have hoped that the policy goal to replace Saddam had a chance to be applied - with more probable success - to Milosevic and his regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the only legitimacy of outside military intervention in Yugoslavia rests on the massive violations of human rights, on Milosevic's crimes against humanity. The international community has every right - many would say a duty - to safeguard basic human rights, whether or not political solutions are reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why did the couple of hastily assembled representatives of the largely unorganized Kosovar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> refuse to sign the proposed settlement? Perhaps, they remembered that Irish patriot, Michael Collins, who in 1921 surprised the Irish people and signed in London the treaty dividing the Irish island. The Irish paid for Michael Collins' rationality with the ci vil war, Michael Collins paid for it with his life, and the settlement of the issue was finally reached in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imposition of political settlements by outside powers rarely works. Our troops are still in Bosnia and will be there for a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week's adjournment of the Rambouillet meeting is yet another victory for Milosevic. He did not come to Rambouillet. Despite Albright's admonition on hostilities, he is now free to resume massacring Kosovars and destroying their villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that happens, will the Kosovo people be ready and able to signify their assent to their representatives, and send them back to Rambouillet to sign an agreement that will leave Milosevic once again at the helm in Yugoslavia? Should they have to live forever under an international protectorate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Milosevic in Belgrade, the three-year period and Kosovo's autonomy are a joke. Milosevic broke the Belgrade agreement brokered by Ambassador Richard Holbrooke in less than four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States should be involved, with broad international support, in responses to massive and continuous violations of human rights, particularly in an area, such as the Balkans, where the United States is already involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when broad political solutions have demonstrably failed in the past, efforts to repeat them could degenerate into a farce. The current impasse at Rambouillet may result in placing the blame on the Kosovars, and otherwise leaving them at Milosevic's mercy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UZICE, Yugoslavia -- Thousands of angry Serbs rallied in this central Serbian town yesterday to demand that President Slobodan Milosevic resign, and police in another Serb town clashed with a similar crowd of anti- government protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Leave, Slobo, leave!'' the crowd chanted, using Mr.  Milosevic's nickname. They cheered the leaders of Serbia's democratic opposition, who organized the protest in Uzice, a town 200 kilometres southwest of Belgrade.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We must go to the end so that Serbia could have a new start. Every day ... we must be in all the streets and stay until he (Milosevic) leaves,'' Democratic party head Zoran Djindjic told the estimated 6,000 people who braved the sweltering heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizers from the Alliance for Change -- the leading umbrella group of Serbia's pro-democracy, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parties -- ignored a police warning to call off the protest in downtown Uzice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, no substantial police presence was visible during the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the latest of several protests in Serbian towns calling for the ouster of the autocratic president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few thousand people took to the streets in the southern Serbian town of Leskovac for the second day yesterday, demanding the resignation of a local governor loyal to Mr. Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters clashed with the police when they approached a police station where the activist who called for Monday's rally was being held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivan Novkovic, an employee in a local TV station, became an instant celebrity when he interrupted the station's programming last week to call for a rally against the allegedly corrupt local governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 20,000 people took to the streets Monday in Leskovac, he was sentenced to 30 days in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Novkovic's individual outcry -- not organized by any opposition party -- was seen by some as a sign of the increasingly bold discontent with Mr. Milosevic for his hard-line policies that led to NATO air strikes and the virtual loss of Serbia's Kosovo province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Serbia has risen, free of fear. Leskovac is an example. Novkovic is better than Milosevic because he is a brave man,'' said Goran Svilanovic, an Alliance leader at the Uzice rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A local priest of the Serbian Orthodox Church also came to express support for the protest in Uzice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a break from tradition, the Church recently openly demanded Mr. Milosevic's resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another opposition activist, Velimir Ilic, called on the police and army to join the people's protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ilic became a major dissident during the NATO bombing by blaming the government for the destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Milosevic loyalists have a long record of successfully outmanoeuvring Yugoslavia's often divided opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaflets blasting the opposition as allies of NATO were thrown on the crowd in Uzice from a nearby skyscraper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another blow to Mr. Milosevic, Serbia's main opposition leader rebuffed the president's attempts to draw him into his coalition in order to boost support for his government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, head of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party, said yesterday he would not join a government led by the pro-Milosevic premier, Momir Bulatovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He demanded a new government led by the pro-Western leader of Yugoslavia's smaller republic, Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also yesterday , the city council of Novi Sad, the second-largest city in Yugoslavia, which was heavily damaged during the 78-day NATO campaign, joined the chorus demanding Milosevic's resignation, the private Beta news agency reported.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The apparently spontaneous capture of the Yugoslav Parliament and state television were the result of a carefully planned strategy, said Velja Ilijc, mayor of Cacak, an opposition stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Extraordinary scenes as riot police threw off their helmets and joined protesters were planned gestures designed to break police lines, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the mayor told the story of the Serbian revolution, one of his party aides sat and played with an unused AK47 round captured from hardline police who fired on Mr Ilijc and the other protesters. A bouquet of flowers on the mayor's desk bore the message: &quot;Thank you for what you have done, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At 7.30am on Thursday, a huge column of protesters set off from Cacak for Belgrade, led by Mr Ilijc. Most were farmers and working men, but among them, said Mr Ilijc, were Yugoslav army paratroops and plainclothes police defectors. As they left, the mayor told them: &quot;Victory or death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They broke through five police blockades on the way to Belgrade, pushing into the ditch the trucks police had used to block roads. As they marched, they were joined by others from towns along the way. When the column reached Belgrade there were 10,000 of them. It was they who led the storming of Parliament and state television with a bulldozer they brought from Cacak. Their targets were carefully selected.Losing control of the media was a fatal blow to Mr Milosevic. &quot;We were sick of watching state television,&quot; said Mr Ilijc, the image of a Serbian macho man lounging in the mayor's office in his tracksuit.&quot;We got fed up with living in Milosevic's Serbia. I planned it all with my buddies. It is Cacak's humble contribution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mayor says he co- ordinated Thursday's event with just four other people: two police officers from an elite unit based in Belgrade and two officers from Cacak. At 3.30pm, a time agreed in advance, the police defectors broke police lines, opening the protesters' path to Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The protest even had assistance from plainclothes police on the way to Belgrade, who tried to persuade police to abandon roadblocks. &quot;I had trouble telling some people not to attack those officers,&quot; laughed the mayor. &quot;I kept saying, 'Wait, they are going to come over to our side'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mayor insists that although it was his protesters who broke into Parliament they were not responsible for the fire started in the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As they forced their way into the building, he says he introduced some of them to the opposition leader, Zoran Djindjic. &quot;I told him, 'You should thank these guys',&quot; he said. He did not tell the opposition of his plan to storm Parliament, but said he did co-ordinate with the Otpor student resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and fans of Belgrade's Red Star football team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Ilijc has long been a die-hard opposition figure. He fled Cacak to hide in mountains for 43 days during last year's Nato bombardment after he was accused of betraying his country by the Milosevic regime. When he returned he was greeted as a hero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We got sick of the way the opposition was going,&quot; he said. &quot;It was useless. We'd march, criticise Milosevic and then everybody went home and he was still there. We decided, 'We are men, let's do it&quot;.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was unsure at first whether he could trust his police contacts. &quot;The test was the miners' strike,&quot; he said. On Tuesday night, police tried to break an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> miners' strike at Kolubara. &quot;My police contacts called me and said that they had been ordered to attack the miners,&quot; Mr Ilijc said. &quot;They told me to get more people over there.&quot; The police attack failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He insists now is not the time for complacency. &quot;Milosevic is still very dangerous,&quot; he said.&quot;It is sickening to see these politicians already squabbling over who will be Prime Minister and ministers. We didn't do it to become ministers and I warn them, if they don't get things right we will march on them as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbia's opposition leader is a lawyer committed to peaceful resistance. Eve Ann Prentice reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vojislav Kostunica cuts an unlikely figure as hero and prospective saviour of Yugoslavia. While despairing Serbs and Western leaders looked the other way in search of a Balkan braveheart to rise up and cut the chains that have kept Slobodan Milosevic in power for the past decade, the quietly spoken rival for the presidency slipped under the ropes and, possibly, felled him at the ballot box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Voting in Yugoslavia's presidential election could well run to a second round on October 8, but Milosevic looks mortally wounded after Sunday's vote. Even if he manages to hang on to power a little longer, his authority seems fatally undermined by Kostunica's strong showing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soon after the end of the Nato bombing campaign last year, many war and sanctions-weary Serbs looked high and low for someone to lead them against the regime. The political options were bleak: the maverick fence-sitter Vuk Draskovic and his Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on one hand, and the Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic on the other. Djindjic's error was to leave Belgrade at the height of the bombing - seen as an act of cowardice by ordinary Serbs who had no choice but to stay put.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To make matters worse, Djindjic and Draskovic proved repeatedly that they could not put personal differences aside and present a united opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A series of opposition rallies around Serbia in the weeks that followed the Alliance campaign were little more than Sunday outings for the curious and a chance for the two opposition groups to squabble. The only exceptions came when protests were organised by two independent rebels: Ivan Novkovic, a renegade television weatherman in the southern town of Leskovac, and Bogoljub &quot;Maki&quot; Arsenijevic, an artist from the central town of Valjevo. However, while these two would-be revolutionaries galvanised people in their home towns, they were never serious contenders for the post of President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During this time, Kostunica waited quietly for his moment in history. It came when Milosevic decided to call early elections and Kostunica was chosen to head a multi-party democratic opposition. Whereas the West had been less than accurate in reading the Balkan mentality, Kostunica had read the runes well. He knew that many Serbs had become wary of firebrand politics and paramilitary adventurism. His message has been an almost Gandhi-esque appeal to peaceful resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So who is the man who seems within inches of achieving what would have looked impossible even three months ago - levering Milosevic from power? And will he meet the West's expectations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vojislav Kostunica, a married man with no children, was nominated as the candidate of 18 parties and one trade union which form the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS). Born in Belgrade in 1944 to an old Belgrade family, he graduated from the Belgrade School of Law in 1966 and went on to obtain a master's degree in 1970 and doctorate in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1970 he was appointed assistant lecturer at the Belgrade School of Law, but expelled in 1974, during a political purge of Belgrade University, because of his opposition to communism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From 1974 until 1981, he worked at the Institute of Social Sciences. He moved on to become director of the Institute for Philosophy and Social Theory. Until recently, his main claim to fame was as a bookish academic and author of papers on constitutional law, political theory and political philosophy. Kostunica has also worked as editor-in-chief of several specialised journals dedicated to law and philosophy, such as the Archive for Legal and Social Sciences, Philosophical Studies, Philosophy and Society and Theoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the Eighties, while Milosevic was climbing the greasy pole to supreme power, Kostunica turned his legal skills to human rights and was especially active in the Board for the Freedom of Thought and Speech, where he was highly regarded. It was around this time that he became involved in politics, becoming a founder of the Democratic Party in 1989. He has been president of the separate Democratic Party of Serbia since it was founded in 1992 and was a member of the Serbian Parliament from 1990 until 1997 - when his party boycotted the elections due to the &quot;lack of regular electoral conditions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western leaders, however, have been nonplussed. Although senior European Union, American and even Russian politicians have been swift to call on Milosevic to give way immediately and hand power to Kostunica, the lawyer has not always been flavour of the month, especially in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kostunica has consistently proclaimed that he would not hand Milosevic over to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, and he was a vigorous critic of the Nato bombardment. This has been seized on by some as proof that he is no different from other war-zealous Balkan leaders. Kostunica has been described in some US state department background briefings as an old-fashioned Serb nationalist, a sort of &quot;Seselj in coat-tails&quot; - a reference to Milosevic's erstwhile ally, Vojislav Seselj, the ultra-nationalist leader of the Serbian Radical Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is where East and West divide. Opponents of the Milosevic regime see nothing wrong in criticising the Alliance campaign - for the bombing affected nearly everyone. While they may be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they believe their political destiny should be decided from within.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Kostunica is a good patriot. He is educated, a peaceful man and no threat to anyone,&quot; says Srdjan Stojanovic, an independent Serbian journalist who lives in London. &quot;He is a calm, even boring speaker, but he insists on following legal procedures. That is what our country needs.&quot; Nikola Barovic, a noted Serbian human rights lawyer, agrees. &quot;He is a very good lawyer and has a high regard for fair play. Because he is very strict and correct, I think he will do all he can to help keep things peaceful,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And an expatriate Serb points out: &quot;He is a politician of impeccable democratic credentials, keen intelligence and high personal integrity. He has not compromised himself either by making deals with Milosevic, unlike Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or by being too subservient to the West like, say, Zoran Djindjic. His consistency and perseverance has finally paid off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And what does Kostunica say? His actions and words in the next few days and weeks will be crucial. So far, he has tried to maintain calm on all sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One encouraging thing is the conduct of the army and police, which was very appropriate - standing between two political options, and not between the so-called patriots and traitors,&quot; he said on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He then promised that, as soon he officially became president, he would start parliamentary talks on the relations between Serbia and Montenegro. Links between the two republics that make up Yugoslavia have been strained to near breaking point since the Nato bombardment when Montenegro intensified attempts to break loose of the federation. Many Serbs now fear civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked how his alliance would react if final voting figures show that he has won but Milosevic fails to recognise the result, Kostunica said that he would defend his victory using all available democratic means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Protests and demonstrations are democratic methods of fighting for your rights. We will defend the will of the people in such a way as not to endanger the peace in the country, nor to challenge any reaction of the international community,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, as for handing Milosevic over to the Hague Tribunal, he is quick to point out that compulsory co-operation with this &quot;so-called&quot; court is not mentioned in Yugoslavia's constitution. &quot;I think that the Hague Tribunal is not a legal, but a political instrument, and not one of the international community, but exclusively of the USA.&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As for Slobodan Milosevic's safety during my presidency, it is regulated by our constitution. The part in which it is said that representatives of our country must take care of their citizens' safety, also refers to the safety of the former FRY President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The would-be President also makes it clear that Yugoslavia must not become &quot;anybody's protectorate&quot; - seen by many as an allusion to the current status of Kosovo. People in Yugoslavia want to live in a state &quot;that is not a vassal&quot;, he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the final word rests with the people of Serbia. &quot;Please God, this time there is hope,&quot; says the wife of one human rights lawyer in Belgrade. &quot;But then I turn my head and look back at the past ten years....&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbs go to the polls today to choose a president and a new parliament but the tension palpable on the streets of the Yugoslav capital in the hours leading up to the vote has revealed the nation's uncertainty about the election and future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yugoslavs appear to be wrestling with the question: &quot;Are we about to elect a president, or descend into violence and war?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm scared a little bit,&quot; admitted Vukasin Petrovic, an activist with the Otpor (Resistance) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;because I can't predict what will happen in the next days. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts and voters both say the elections are the most crucial Yugoslavia has faced in more than a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About seven million Serb voters will pass judgment on the tumultuous 13-year regime of President Slobodan Milosevic, a Communist leader who won power in 1987 and rode successfully into the post-Communist era on a wave of nationalism and war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public opinion suggests Milosevic will lose the election to Vojislav Kostunica, a previously obscure academic who leads in the polls by six to 20 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica, leader of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia alliance, is favoured to win in a fair fight. But the tension galvanizing Yugoslavia hinges on the widespread fear the Milosevic government will attempt to steal the election and defend the theft with the might of the Yugoslav Army and the federation's paramilitary police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since opposition supporters are expected to take to the streets en masse if the government rigs the vote, many Serbs fear the election will end in tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be blood,&quot; said Aleks Milutinovic, 33, a Belgrade journalist. &quot;That's my prediction. The government will steal the election, the opposition will protest, and the police will crack down hard. Milosevic has shown a willingness to unleash his attack dogs at the first sign of protest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But anything can happen. Here are some possibilities:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Milosevic will win by stealing votes in Montenegro and Kosovo, declare victory, and use the armed forces to back him up. The likely result: protests and violence across Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Milosevic will lose, concede defeat, but invoke the nation's old constitution and remain in office until next summer. The likely result: protests by the outraged opposition. But if Milosevic is successful he will buy time to regroup and fortify his position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- None of the four presidential candidates will win an outright majority, forcing a second round in October or November. Result: Milosevic gains time to plan a comeback. But opposition candidates could back Kostunica in a second round, burying Milosevic in an opposition landslide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Milosevic will lose the presidential elections, concede defeat, but steal local elections and retain power by controlling the parliament and cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Montenegro have created fears there will be a post-election conflict in this independence-minded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yugoslav republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Serbs are grappling with all these sad scenarios.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything depends on Milosevic,&quot; said Otpor's Petrovic, &quot;and the state of his conscience and mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Mr. Kostunica has been described in some U.S. State Department briefings as an old-fashioned Serb nationalist, a sort of ''Seselj in coattails,'' a reference to Mr. Milosevic's erstwhile ally, Vojislav Seselj, the ultra- nationalist leader of the Serbian Radical Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is where East and West divide. Opponents of the Milosevic regime see nothing wrong in criticizing the Alliance campaign, for the bombing affected nearly everyone. While they may be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they believe their political destiny should be decided from within.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Kostunica is a good patriot. He is educated, a peaceful man and no threat to anyone,'' says Srdjan Stojanovic, an independent Serbian journalist who lives in London. ''He is a calm, even boring speaker, but he insists on following legal procedures. That is what our country needs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nikola Barovic, a noted Serbian human rights lawyer, says ''He is a very good lawyer and has a high regard for fair play. Because he is very strict and correct, I think he will do all he can to help keep things peaceful.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An expatriate Serb calls him ''a politician of impeccable democratic credentials, keen intelligence and high personal integrity. He has not compromised himself either by making deals with Milosevic, unlike Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or by being too subservient to the West like, say, Zoran Djindjic. His consistency and perseverance has finally paid off.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Mr. Kostunica has tried to maintain calm on all sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''One encouraging thing is the conduct of the army and police, which was very appropriate standing between two political options, and not between the so-called patriots and traitors,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then promised that, as soon as he officially becomes president, he will start parliamentary talks on the relations between Serbia and Montenegro. Links between the two republics that make up Yugoslavia have been strained to near breaking point since the NATO bombardment when Montenegro intensified attempts to break loose of the federation. Many Serbs now fear civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked how his alliance would react if final voting figures show that he has won but Mr. Milosevic fails to recognize the result, Mr. Kostunica said he would defend his victory using all available democratic means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Protests and demonstrations are democratic methods of fighting for your rights. We will defend the will of the people in such a way as not to endanger the peace in the country, nor to challenge any reaction of the international community, '' he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as for handing Mr. Milosevic over to the Hague tribunal, he is quick to point out that compulsory co-operation with this ''so-called'' court is not mentioned in the constitution. ''I think that the Hague tribunal is not a legal, but a political instrument, and not one of the international community, but exclusively of the U.S.A.,'' he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''As for Slobodan Milosevic's safety during my presidency, it is regulated by our constitution. The part in which it is said that representatives of our country must take care of their citizens' safety, also refers to the safety of the former ... president.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The would-be president also makes it clear that Yugoslavia must not become ''anybody's protectorate,'' seen by many as an allusion to the current status of Kosovo. People in Yugoslavia want to live in a state ''that is not a vassal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the final word rests with the people of Serbia. ''Please God, this time there is hope,'' says the wife of one human rights lawyer in Belgrade. ''But then I turn my head and look back at the past 10 years.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NATO'S hi-tech air war is unlikely to be enough to budge Yugoslavia's decidedly low-tech but well-trained armed forces from Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first two weeks of air strikes have been visually impressive: the sagging wrecks of the interior ministry buildings in Belgrade hit at the weekend were stark evidence that Nato means business. But while the hits are terrifying for the Serb people, the Yugoslav military machine that Nato aims to 'degrade' could sit out the air strikes for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nato has yet to release hard evidence that it has seriously damaged Yugoslav air defences, especially its ageing Soviet-designed SAM-6 surface-to-air missiles, which are mobile and hard to track down. 'These are dangerous,' said Clifford Beale, editor of Jane's Defence Weekly. 'They can shoot and move.' He said Yugoslav air defence was far more integrated and concentrated than its Iraqi equivalent, and Serbian forces were adept at using apparently low-tech tricks to confound Nato's 'smart' weapons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of these is the 'SAM-bush' luring in aircraft with a decoy radar and then locking in on it with a missile radar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Yugoslav army also has hundreds of shoulder-fired ground-to-air missiles and about 2,000 anti-aircraft guns which could give Nato's slower tank-busting jets and helicopters a hard time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ever since the first threat of Nato raids last October, the Yugoslav army and police units have been careful to move men, armour and material around. Ammunition has been brought out of store. Tanks and other weapons are parked in forests and draped with camouflage netting in fields and ravines to avoid detection by aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Politically it's difficult for Milosevic right now as Nato is dropping everything on Serbia and Serbia doesn't appear to be really hitting back,' a political observer in Belgrade said. 'But the army is, as they say, waiting for Nato to come in 'low and slow'.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Serb military analyst who fought in the 1991-92 war with Croatia cast doubts on the effectiveness of the Nato air campaign. 'Other than long-term degradation of the army, this is not going to have a short-term impact certainly not in time to save the refugees. The Yugoslav army doesn't need barracks and sophisticated anti-aircraft defences to fight this war.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Serbian forces have cleansed most of the centres of the Kosovo Liberation Army's operational zones and have disrupted their core,' the political observer said. It would take months to train and equip a new force, however angry the ethnic Albanians expelled from the territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western military officers with the international observer mission in Kosovo noticed, before their evacuation last month, extensive preparations of defences against a Nato attack from neighbouring Macedonia. They say that a strategic bridge and a tunnel have been mined by the Yugoslav army, ready to blow should Nato armour risk the narrow gorge of the Kacanik pass. The Shar mountains along the border would be territory relatively easy to defend, where tanks have only the most limited </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western diplomats have made much of a reluctance of Serb men to obey the call -up. This was certainly the case before the air strikes. But much of sophisticated Belgraders' reluctance to fight has evapourated with the anger at Nato's attacks and with stiff new prison terms for draft-dodgers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The length of the country, the more hardline Serbs of all ages can be seen in old reservist uniforms. All Serb men of fighting age in Kosovo are under arms and are highly motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic prepared for the showdown with Nato countries months in advance of air strikes when he purged the Serbian security forces of all senior dissenting voices. The purge continued last week with the sacking of the 2nd Army commander in Serbia's sister republic of Montenegro, where an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti -Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government is trying to keep the territory out of the war. The new commander is a hardline Serb who commands more than 10,000 troops there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result of the purges it is thought there is little chance of Serb army dissent. 'The army are fully behind Milosevic. They are in this trap together,' the political observer said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past 17 days Belgrade's streets have been filled with anti-government demonstrators, but the forces ranged against them are gathering momentum - and all President Slobodan Milosovic has to do is bide his time. CHRISTOPHER HENNING reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOW much power is there in an egg? Fifty or so grams of viscous liquid in a palm-size container, thrown by a protester a maximum of, say, 30 metres - what's the destructive force of that? It may annoy a riot policeman. It may break a window. Can it undermine a government? Serbia's opposition parties are hoping so, as they feel their way along the fine dividing line between protest and riot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have been protesting for 17 consecutive days against President Slobodan Milosevic for annulling elections that they had won. Protesting, note, not rioting. They make sure they throw nothing harder than eggs, so that if the police come and the riot sticks and tear gas come out, they can say they did not provoke the clampdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eggs are one of their two weapons; outrage is the other. The two represent motivation plus restraint, the symbols of those holding the moral high ground.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against a lesser opponent those weapons might prevail. In Prague in 1989 an entrenched communist regime collapsed before crowds whose tactic was to stand in the snow in vast numbers holding lighted candles. But Milosevic is an opponent very different from the jaded apparatchiki of Communism in decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is self-made. He created his own power base, and he stands on it still. He is not timid in the use of power: he has, by proxy, expanded Serb-controlled territory at the expense of his neighbours. He is dexterous: he has eluded all except the last attempt of Western Europe to thwart his ambitions. He took a backward step only when NATO (that is to say, the United States) became involved, and even it dealt with him as an equal and ceded him much of what he wanted. And he has no time for doubters: he has crushed dissent at home before, in 1991, with an iron fist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eggs aren't going to scare him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SLOBODAN Milosevic is on the horns of a familiar dilemma. He must have Western investment to boost an economy run down after years of war, but he can't afford to allow in Western notions of human rights and democracy that may jeopardise his hold on power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic came to power promising to restore pride to Serbs, and to create a single Serb State. His extreme nationalist policies were one of the central reasons Yugoslavia broke up as it did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After four years of war, he may have gone some way to satisfying his countrymen's dreams of national aggrandisement - though that is debatable - but he has not made them prosper. When he came to power income per head was about $US2,000. These days it is about $US1,000. In places, unemployment reaches 50 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the final turning points in the Bosnian war was the Croatian offensive in Krajina, which took back Serb-held territory in north-western Bosnia and Croatia, and made refugees of about half a million Serbs who had lived in Croatia for centuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbia is now struggling with a gigantic resettlement task while its economy labours under Western sanctions and its own selfimposed limitations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democracy, in the form of elections, was the cause of his present troubles. On November 3, Serbians and Montenegrins went to the polls in elections for the lower house of the Yugoslav Federal Parliament. (Serbia and Montenegro are all that is left of the former Yugoslavia after it disintegrated in 1990.) Montenegrins also voted for a provincial assembly, and Serbians for local councils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic had done his best to ensure a favourable result. He has complete control of Yugoslavian television, so there was no question of the opposition getting much of a run. But he had also changed the law before the poll to make it hard for small parties to win. Four parties promptly stymied that move by uniting to form Zajedno (Together).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they had some wins. In the Federal Parliament they won just 22 seats out of 138, but at the local level they won Belgrade and 12 of the other 18 largest cities in Serbia. Those local election results were promptly overturned, and Zajedno called its supporters onto the streets. They have been there ever since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yugoslavian Foreign Minister, Milan Milutinovic, in London for the Bosnian peace implementation conference, has played down reports of the demonstrations. &quot;You said 100,000 people (were on the streets of Belgrade). That is not true. It is 10 times less,&quot; he said. &quot;And in comparison with 2 million people in Belgrade, if you have 10 or 15 or 50,000 demonstrators on the streets, that does not mean that we have a mounting of the dangers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milutinovic may believe that; it is unlikely that as canny a politician as Milosevic does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But why did he overturn the results in the first place? The opposition victories threaten to disturb the calm of Yugoslavia's centrally run economy, and the widespread networks of patronage by which it operates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yugoslavia is run by a left-wing post-communist coalition. The main party is Milosevic's Serbian Socialist Party (SPS), but a junior partner is the United Yugoslav Left (JUL) founded by his wife Mirjana, better known as Mira. The latter has little popular support, but its adherents wield increasing power within the bureaucracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mihailo Markovic, a former senior SPS member, explained the strategic importance of the JUL: &quot;They have seized control of the trade departments, so it means they have the final say in who gets import and export licences. Those are the key in such a closed economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic has much against him, not least the international community, but he has many things on his side - the police, which he has built up substantially, the media, which he rigidly controls, and to a lesser extent the army, although that has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">run down lately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two other important factors. The first is the opposition itself. Zajedno is a coalition of very different interests. Zoran Djindjic, the long-haired, bearded leader of the Democratic Party who has been leading the street protests, would have been Belgrade's first non-communist mayor since World War II if the results had not been annulled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, the other leader, is head of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As its name suggests, this is a party of Serbian nationalism, and his rhetoric in the past has been every bit as extreme as that of his adversary, Milosevic. That doesn't mean they are allies by any means. Draskovic was arrested and jailed in the big protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against Milosevic in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two haven't quarrelled yet, but without continuing success it is hard to see two such strong personalities maintaining their solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other ally Milosevic has is the weather. General Winter has defeated two armies in Russia, and he may yet do the same to the enemies of Slobodan Milosevic. All it will take is time - something Milosevic has plenty of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, he can't really afford to do anything against the demonstrators. He cannot afford to crack down on the opposition as he has in the past, for fear of outraging Western opinion. Although many sanctions against Serbia were lifted at the time of the Dayton agreement last year, some remain, and they are important. Serbia still has no access to the International Monetary Fund, and has been suspended from the Organisation of Security and Co-operation in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Milosevic fell, who would replace him? According to Dr Spiros Economides of the London School of Economics, instability would be the result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The opposition party Zajedno, which is at the vanguard of the popular uprising, is not a very solid party. It's split between the various personalities,&quot; Economides said. &quot;If Milosevic were to fall, some of the people who may replace him are no less nationalist than he is. Who would the West be dealing with?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Peace in Bosnia is the main reason why the West has kept quiet about what is going on in Belgrade. They know he is feared enough by the Croats and Muslims for the peace to be kept.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEFORE the election, Zajedno was accusing the West of propping up Milosevic. It claimed Western diplomats made high-profile visits to factories, which were broadcast in a way that presented the West as backing the Serbian regime. US diplomats denied any attempt to influence the outcome, and said they were neutral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the winter weather worsens and as Milosevic continues to let the protesters freeze, if they choose, in support of a principle, Zajedno is now looking to the West to help it bring Milosevic down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the US was ever prepared to prop up Milosevic in the interest of post-Dayton harmony, that appears no longer to be the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington has responded to Serbia's ban on an independent radio station, B92, by announcing it will use Voice of America to broadcast into Serbia itself. But these are not the good old days of the Cold War, when Radio Free Europe brought the message of freedom to the oppressed masses behind the Iron Curtain. Milosevic is a nationalist, and the Serbs, though they may be getting sick of Milosevic himself, are fiercely nationalistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US, which has pretended to be even-handed in the Bosnian conflict while backing all the other sides against the Serbs, is a prime object for such paranoia. Milosevic won't be displeased that he will now have a large, loud bogeyman to point to as a scapegoat for problems that he has done the most to create.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sri Lanka, March 11 -- A close look at the barrage of Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the International Crisis Group (ICG) produced anti-Sri Lanka propaganda aimed at reinforcing the message of the British Channel 4 video falsehoods at the 22nd session of the UNHRC reveals much about the people and the techniques used in the global administration of the neocon generated 'pretend' human rights regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HRW provided bogus information-based reports histrionically titled 'Human Rights Failings Detailed' and 'Rape of Tamil Detainees', and wrote letters to UNHRC member countries demanding an inquiry. They also wrote to the Commonwealth heads of governments demanding that the November 2013 CHOGM Meeting be moved from Sri Lanka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such coordinated moves are built on the same principles their multi-national corporations employ to 'alter perception' on consumer products that are proven to be harmful to human health as 'cool' life style choices.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this particular case, de-contextualised and distorted pictorial images of war and stories of abuse are presented in an arrogant, conspiratorial tone to psychologically influence the UNHRC member countries. The underlying objective is to keep Sri Lanka on the UNHRC agenda as a counterweight against the imminent Palestinian war crimes charges against Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extremely close tribal connections emanating from the common, let us say Phoenician, background of the people involved in the HRW fraud, with a sprinkling of other naive and cynically dollar seeking people, help read and understand their behaviour and activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The career history of almost every member of the HRW cabal shows a degree from a university such as Harvard, Georgetown or Johns Hopkins, previous UN involvement commonly in post - Pol Pot Cambodia and other countries of interest to them such as Indonesia, and remarkably long term occupancy of positions, often exceeding a decade, by those who hold management positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The members of the cabal keep on drifting between the US bureaucracy, UN agencies and the INGO circuit, donning human rights cloaks over their blood-stained suits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose here is to highlight the corrupt founding of the HRW and the tribal and incestuous relationships among the pompous and arrogant cabal that go on preaching to the world. Such information helps gain an understanding of the sinister coalescence between the neocon generated US foreign policy and the UNHRC operations following its recasting in 2006 to better suit the US agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HRW is birth marked 'fraud'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HRW was founded in New York as Helsinki Watch in 1978 by Robert Bernstein, the owner of &quot;Random House&quot; publishers, as a Cold War instrument against the Soviet Union and the socialist bloc countries of Eastern Europe. From the very beginning, the charter of HRW has been to undermine nations by providing a web of &quot;support&quot; for pro-capitalist forces and political dissidents globally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billionaire George Soros soon took over HRW and linked it with his own personal subversive NGO, Open Society Institute(OSI) by appointing Helsinki Watch head Aryeh Neier, to head the OSI - From 1979, Soros distributed $3m annually to dissidents in the Soviet bloc countries including Poland's Solidarity </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia and Andrei Sakharov in Russia. In 1984, he founded his first OSI branch in Hungary and pumped millions of dollars into opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ostensibly aimed at building up a &quot;civil society&quot;, these initiatives were designed to weaken the existing political structures and pave the way for Eastern Europe's eventual colonisation by the neocon owned global capital. Soros now openly claims that he was responsible for the &quot;Americanisation&quot; of Eastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, HRW has an annual budget of around $50 million and employs almost 300 operatives in 90 countries. They claim to publish around 100 reports and several hundred news releases each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 2010 HRW received a further 10-year, $100 million capital injection from Soros, with orders to increase its global presence by opening up advocacy offices in key regional capitals around the world with a view &quot;to shape the foreign policies of the emerging powers&quot;. The structure they are going to adopt is the Transparency International's business model of employing more &quot;researchers and advocates&quot;, to engage with government officials, journalists, and civil society - a model that defines &quot;conspiracy&quot; in the modern context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HRW is a key instrument in implementing neocon global agenda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hiding behind a facade of monitoring human rights &quot;abuses&quot; worldwide HRW works to reinforce the neocon global agenda and to justify US &quot;humanitarian interventions&quot; through pre-invasion propaganda aimed at demonising the respective national leaders and their administrations. Most recently they did this in Libya, and is currently at work against Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HRW board currently includes Morton Abramowitz, a founder neocon and Assistant Secretary of State for intelligence and research in the Ronald Reagan era, and a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations - Warren Zimmerman, US ambassador in Yugoslavia during the break-up, and Paul Goble, director of communications at the CIA-created, Soros-funded Radio Free Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other &quot;independent&quot; luminaries include warmongers like Zbigniew Brzezinski, Richard Allen, General Wesley Clark, and former congressman Stephen Solarz, described as &quot;the Israel lobby's chief legislative tactician on Capitol Hill&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HRW carries out the functions of informational and propagandist support for USA and NATO projects to interfere in the internal affairs of foreign countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A book titled Human Rights Watch in Service to the War Party, (Edward S. Herman, David Peterson and George Szamuely, 2007), after examining HRW's role in supporting the breakup of Yugoslavia, concludes that - &quot;HRW has... been an important contributor to human rights violations in the former Yugoslavia. HRW helped stir up passions in the demonization process from 1992 onward and actively and proudly contributed to preparing the ground for NATO's 'supreme international crime' in March 1999.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yugoslav people's stubborn resistance to US meddling expressed through their repeated election of Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party to government was broken through Soros' Open Society Institute funding, more than $100m between 1991-1999, to the coffers of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opposition, political parties, printing presses and &quot;independent&quot; media such as Radio B92.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic was finally toppled in 2000 in a coup d'etat financed and planned in Washington. He was carted before the Hague tribunal to face charges of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide, based on the largely uncorroborated anecdotal evidence of HRW. He was poisoned in jail before the case came to an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soros claims that his financing of dissent in poorer countries is purely altruistic - asked about the havoc his currency speculation caused to Asian economies in the crash of 1997, Soros replied - &quot;As a market participant, I don't need to be concerned with the consequences of my actions. It was only the courageous actions of leaders like Dr Mahathir Mohamed of Malaysia who blocked Soros 'pulling out' his speculative capital averted the crisis in some countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fraudulent partisan behaviour of HRW becomes obvious through their silence on issues like the findings of the report, just a month ago, on the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child that it is &quot;alarmed at reports of the death of hundreds of children as a result of attacks and air strikes by the US military forces in Afghanistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HRW's clear agenda of sanitising Israeli war crimes like the 2002 Jenin refugee camp massacre in the West Bank came to light with its attempt to tell the world that &quot;no massacre had taken place in Jenin&quot;. The HRW was alone, and was against a mountain of evidence that suggested otherwise. Based on the HRW revision, the Bush administration demanded that the Palestinians condemned violence while calling Ariel Sharon 'a man of peace' and expressing sympathy for Israeli 'self-defense' measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January this year, HRW sacked from its board the only honourable and genuine human rights campaigner they ever had, Richard Falk - he was told that his work with the UN on behalf of the Palestinians was &quot;contrary to HRW policy&quot;. He was often critical of Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter on Sri Lanka proves the links</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HRW letter to UNHRC council members demanded that they authorise an independent, international investigation into 'war crimes' committed during the final months of Sri Lanka's armed conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter is another demonstration of the naked attempts to impose their own Phoenician cultural values and neocon economic model as the only path to human freedom and rights universally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is ironic that despite ample evidence pointing to the barbaric nature of their militaristic culture, they try to assume moral authority and credibility over the countries they target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter was signed by Brad Adams, Asia Director of HRW and a woman named Julie de Rivero who holds the fancy designation, Geneva Advocacy Director. The careers and backgrounds of Brad Adams, who has occupied the position of 'Asia Director' since 2002, and Julie de Rivero of this shadowy cabal portrays the seamless manner in which the conspiracies between UN agencies and INGOs such as HRW merge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to joining the HRW in 2002, Adams, obviously an American of Phoenician extraction has worked for five years in Cambodia as a lawyer attached to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights(OHCHR), conducting human rights investigations, and drafting and revising legislation for judicial 'reform' of that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Rivero, a dual Peruvian and British national, has 'coincidentally' worked with the OHCHR, also in Cambodia as the head of its 'protection team'. Prior to that, since 1996, she has worked at numerous UN positions including as an assistant to the UN special rapporteurs on the human rights of migrants, and on freedom of expression. She has then joined the NGO International Service for Human Rights to campaign for the creation of a 'protection mechanism' for human rights defenders. Now De Rivero works exclusively, based in Geneva, on 'advocacy' with the OHCHR on the work of the UNHRC. What this advocacy work means in Western jargon is 'having a chat over a Latte' at a trendy coffee shop with the career minded human rights worker currently handling the 'case' at the OHCHR, having an eye on the HRW or another such INGO as a possible employer at the end of 'her'(usually) UN contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A national government or their Geneva representation has not got the chance of 'a snowball in hell' in countering such 'advocacy'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charu Lata wants to teach us a lesson too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is often not highlighted is that the arrogantly named HRW report &quot;We Will Teach You A Lesson&quot;, though released under the HRW banner, has been the work, under contract, of an Indian and British dual national Charu Lata Hogg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charu currently works as an Associate Fellow, Asia Programme at Chatham House, the counterpart of the neocon cabal Council on Foreign Affairs in Britain. The report has been 'edited' by Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director at HRW. Phelim Kine is a Canadian, a China researcher in HRW's Asia Division. A former news wire bureau chief in Jakarta, he has worked as a 'journalist' for more than a decade in China, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Taiwan prior to joining HRW in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charu Lata Hogg is in fact a former staffer, a South Asia Researcher, of HRW (2007 - 2009) who holds an MSc from the London School of Economics. Between 1990 and 2002 she has worked as a journalist in India and Sri Lanka for a number of media organisations including the BBC. She also works as a South Asia Analyst for a number of businesses including Janes Defence, and is a consultant to International Alert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hogg has left HRW to become Asia Manager of another NGO, Child Soldiers International, (CSI) in London, a registered charity with an annual income of over &pound; 825,000! CSI serves as an 'information resource centre' for related NGOs, child advocacy organisations, and international legislative bodies - it is up the NGO food chain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They claim to contribute research reports to the United Nations Security Council, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, and to the European Union. The CSI is a reincarnation of another NGO founded jointly in 1998 by Amnesty International, HRW, International Save the Children Alliance, World Vision International and other regional non-governmental organisations from Latin America, Africa and Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CSI Board of Trustees of six independent experts is Chaired by Demelza Hauser, former Programme Director (1993-2002), Asia and Pacific Region, Amnesty International. Hauser is also a Cambodia 'specialist' with stints in East Timor, Indonesia, the Solomon Islands and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is very likely that Charu Lata Hogg was hired for this task due to the difficulty the HRW would have in gaining access to people in Jaffna. Charu Lata is familiar with Sri Lanka, having been based there for her 'journalistic' work, and she probably came in as a tourist and operated 'under cover' in the North and the East to compile her methodologically extremely poor report. Attempts to find out her fee were unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other examples of cross breeding between HRW, INGOs, US government and the UN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pattern that emerges is that almost without exception, these INGO frauds recruit well trained operatives who have previously lived and 'worked' in the developing world under NGO, UN or journalist cover - those who are effective are employed for decades to 'heavy' the world in to submission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Ross, Legal and Policy Director at HRW, where he has worked since 2001, previously worked for Medecins sans Frontieres in the Netherlands, in Bosnia for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and in Cambodia for the NGO International Human Rights Law Group. He is a graduate of Harvard Law School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Saunders, Deputy Programme Director at HRW for the past 14 years was a corporate lawyer at Cleary, Gottlieb, Stein and Hamilton in New York. He has worked on Indonesia for more than 25 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carroll Bogert, Deputy Executive Director for External Relations since 1998 spent more than a decade in international news reporting for Newsweek Magazine, in China, as bureau chief in Moscow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan Egeland, Deputy Executive Director and the Director of its European Operations was the Executive Director of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs and UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator from 2003 to 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chuck Lustig, Deputy Executive Director of Operations previously worked at ABC News, ultimately serving as director of foreign news. He negotiated with the North Korean government to allow ABC reporters access to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michele Alexander, Deputy Executive Director for Development and Global Initiatives was previously vice president for corporate support of CARE. While at CARE, she also worked on contract for USAID in Pakistan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly half the work force in Yugoslavia is unemployed and high inflation is eating away at citizens' already barren lifestyle. Economic sanctions continue to pinch recovery from war. Hundreds of political activists are in jail, sometimes enduring beatings, and assassinations are common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the man who presides over all of this, President Slobodan Milosevic, regarded by the United States and its allies as the greatest single threat to peace in Eastern Europe, is almost certain to secure another four-year term in elections he has called for Sept. 24, senior U.S. and European officials predict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through intimidation, political manipulation and lofty nationalist rhetoric, he is settling in as the Saddam Hussein of Europe, a man who lost a war but holds onto power indefinitely.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic has effectively run Yugoslavia since 1989. Today &quot;there is no credible alternative&quot; to him, laments a U.S. government analyst, who asked not to be identified. No opposition figure with the moral stature and political skill of Lech Walesa of Poland has surfaced. Most opposition leaders here have &quot;congenitally bad judgment&quot; that leads them to make self-serving decisions, the analyst said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Milosevic election victory, said Bratislav Grubacic, editor of the Belgrade newsletter VIP Daily News Report, would &quot;crush the hopes of the West that peaceful change can happen&quot; in Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a new term in hand, some U.S. officials fear, Milosevic may feel emboldened to incite new resistance to the Western-led peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and Kosovo. They also say they worry he will grind down the pro-Western leaders of Montenegro, a republic that is ostensibly part of Yugoslavia, or provoke an incident there that could justify a military takeover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would be moving at a time when there is little appetite in Western capitals for another military confrontion with Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At NATO headquarters in Brussels, command center for the 11-week bombing campaign that forced Milosevic's troops out of Kosovo last year, &quot;the mood is one of weary resignation,&quot; said a diplomat there Friday. &quot;The basic view is that he has rigged the system to get himself reelected. . . . Milosevic leaves us in a position where there is not that much we can do about Milosevic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A U.S. official who works on Balkans issues agreed. &quot;It is difficult to see any basis&quot; for Milosevic's departure in the next few years, he complained, expressing a common viewpoint in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearful of assassination--a NATO airstrike demolished one of his houses--the 58-year-old president rarely appears in public, and only then to deliver brief speeches to supporters about the evils of fascism. Indicted for war crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo, he is still shunned by virtually all foreign leaders, although he has hosted senior emissaries this year from a handful of other isolated states, such as Iraq and Burma, as well as the speaker of the Chinese parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our president . . . is the symbol of that struggle for the defense of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence,&quot; said Ivica Dacic, a top ruling party official, in a recent interview on state-run television. Thanks to Milosevic, he added, Yugoslavia managed &quot;to preserve our right to decide about our fate ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That kind of talk plays well with segments of the Yugoslav population, to whom he is a hero who stands up to Western intimidation. But recent polls in Yugoslavia have indicated that more than two-thirds of the electorate favors Milosevic's ouster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is that his opposition is deeply divided, and polls also indicate that each of his potential political opponents is even less popular than he is. Widespread apathy and cynicism is also likely to undermine the voting turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, who heads the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the nation's largest opposition party, told Belgrade's radio B2-92 after surviving an assassination attempt in mid-June that he had no interest in the elections. &quot;Let them have everything, let them choke on it, let them choke on their own power,&quot; said the rattled politician. On Tuesday his party's spokesman reiterated that it would neither participate in the elections nor support any candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coalition that governs Montenegro has also repeatedly said its supporters will not vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a dark forest, and we are up the creek again,&quot; said Nenad Canak, an opposition political leader in Serbia's Vojvodina region, in an interview Thursday with the independent Beta news agency in Yugoslavia. &quot;If we participate in the elections, we must accept that Milosevic will cheat, and if we don't, we hand everything to him on a plate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Milosevic formally announced his candidacy. He would not be running at all were it not for constitutional changes that he pushed through the Yugoslav parliament. Those changes removed a bar on him seeking a new term. They also set up a system of direct election of the president, which Milosevic's supporters claim can only increase democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously, the parliament elected the president, and its Montenegrin members were in turn selected by the republic's governing coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes permanently diluted the governing coalition's influence in the national parliament, causing Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic to press for statements by German, Italian and other Western leaders that they will not respect the election results. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has concurred, arguing that the constitutional amendments were like ones the Nazis used to silence dissent in the mid-1930s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new rules, which were ratified by the parliament on Monday, Milosevic can win by gaining a simple majority of votes cast, no matter how low the turnout. U.S. officials also said they expect Milosevic, whose appointees will have complete control of the procedures for both presidential and municipal elections to be held the same day, to stuff the ballot boxes if needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Milosevic victory would reflect a spectacular dissipation of popular anger since May 18, when 20,000 people gathered in front of the Belgrade city hall to protest the government's seizure of an opposition-controlled television station. Longstanding divisions between opposition leaders surfaced even then, as they failed to agree on a joint call to action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic adds to the disarray through repression. A popular student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called Otpor, or &quot;resistance,&quot; has been debilitated by a concerted government crackdown. The U.S.-based independent agency Human Rights Watch said that in May and June 500 Otpor activists had been detained and interrogated, and that beatings were administered with impunity by &quot;plainclothes thugs believed to be working for the Serbian government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In preparation for the election, Milosevic has taken pains to rein in the country's few remaining independent media outlets. Essential equipment has been stolen from radio and television stations in the cities of Nis and Pancevo; a Radio Free Europe correspondent was reportedly assaulted by police in front of his wife and children last month; and the publication of three Belgrade daily newspapers has been undermined by a mysterious, lingering shortage of newsprint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past week, Information Minister Goran Matic has also charged a Belgrade weekly, a magazine, a newspaper and a respected journalist, Liljana Smajlovic, with taking orders from the CIA, a claim that Smajlovic said has put her life in danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic has tried to build support inside and outside the country. He was recently proclaimed a &quot;national hero&quot; by the hand-picked general staff of the Yugoslav army; he called on Montenegrin citizens &quot;to continue to fight against fascism and for a joint life with Serbia&quot;; and he recently ousted nearly two dozen judges who refused to follow the government's orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only thing that matters to Milosevic and his wife are the two of them, and their children, and their power,&quot; a U.S. analyst said. &quot;No one else matters or exists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials discount the likelihood that he would seek or accept a deal to step aside in exchange for a United Nations vote to expunge his 1999 indictment by the international war crimes tribunal for atrocities in Bosnia and Kosovo. Likewise, a military coup is considered unlikely, given the army's continuing loyalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In U.S. officials' view, any transition that does come is likely to be violent, resulting perhaps from public unrest stirred by a brutal crackdown by police, or by exceptional inflation and food shortages. The moment would be &quot;messy . . . a quick and bloody transition of power . . . followed by several days of chaos, looting and burning&quot; before his successors attempt to reach out to Western powers, the analyst said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, Western governments are sticking with their existing tools of pressure: diplomatic isolation, economic sanctions and offers of substantial aid if Milosevic is ever replaced. Continuation of the economic sanctions has become increasingly difficult to sell in the West, however--France, Ireland, Sweden and Finland recently have said publicly that the sanctions should be loosened, on the ground that that would promote political change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, some Western officials say they are particularly worried that the 10,000 to 12,000 Yugoslav army troops stationed in Montenegro could depose the government there on the slightest provocation. The U.S. analyst said about 15,000 Montenegrin Interior Ministry troops have neither the equipment nor the training for an effective resistance. They are, he said, &quot;like temporary deputy sheriffs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Djukanovic of Montenegro said in a recent interview that &quot;if a conflict breaks out, I am sure that the international community would not sit idly by.&quot; But U.S. officials said that NATO has not authorized planning for potential alliance intervention in an armed conflict there, partly because of general alarm about the state of chaos that still prevails in Kosovo one year later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some U.S. defense officials favor a more activist approach, arguing that a conflict or coup in Montenegro would threaten the peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo. But France in particular is said by alliance officials to have argued against authorizing such planning, fearing it might embolden Djukanovic to move toward independence and provoke Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials respond that this risk can be managed. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said two weeks ago that Washington does not support an independent Montenegro. &quot;We support a democratic Montenegro within a democratic Yugoslavia,&quot; Boucher said. But he did not mention that few U.S. or European officials anticipate democracy will exist in Yugoslavia any time soon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The roots of the recent Yugoslav tragedy lay in the resurgence of extreme nationalism in Serbia: this found its initial outlet in the brutal suppression of Kosovo, especially from 1987, which in turn galvanised the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for independence in Slovenia and Croatia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today it is Serbia's continued designs both on Bosnia and on Kosovo and the unwillingness of the international community to deal with these in a determined and proactive manner, particularly regarding Kosovo, which is the primary source of instability in the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kosovo is in a state of political turmoil and economic stagnation due to the insistence by the international community on deferring consideration of its final political status until it is deemed that a satisfactory level of political &quot;standards&quot; has been achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this may appear to represent a responsible policy in theory, in practice it is quite the opposite: it ignores realities on the ground, exacerbates intercommunal tensions and prevents any effective inward investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reality it represents a failure of nerve by the international community and a desire simply to play for time and defer the difficult decisions that are necessary both to arrive at a peaceful resolution to the Kosovo crisis and to discredit the extreme nationalism emanating from Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record of the Yugoslav army in Kosovo in the 1999 war and since is appalling: 12,000 dead; massive numbers of women raped; 120,000 homes destroyed in an orgy of arson and pillage; a million people &quot;ethnically cleansed&quot;. The fate of 3,000 missing Kosovars is still unknown while Belgrade continues to hold the remains of a further nearly 700 in morgues as a kind of grotesque bargaining tool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following an initial spurt of reconstruction, the period since 2001 has seen a precipitous decline in the economy. The greatest contributory factor to this is the failure of inward investment arising from Kosovo's indeterminate political status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statistics are shocking: unemployment is 57 per cent, with 15 per cent of the population having to survive on an average of 62 cent per day. GDP per capita in Kosovo in the year 2003 was EUR 642.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much is made of the outbreak of violence in March as an example of Kosovo's unpreparedness for self-determination: in reality it is the economic crisis precipitated by Kosovo's unresolved status that is the root cause of intercommunal tensions and resultant instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the problems of Kosovo are inextricably linked with the continued ascendancy of the ultranationalist agenda within Serbia, which manipulates the Serbian minority in Kosovo in pursuit of its own agenda, while the current policies of the EU have the effect of encouraging aspirations in Belgrade towards the ethnic partition of Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flashpoints of instability - Serbia and Montenegro, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia - all have their origins in the as yet incomplete process of disintegration of Yugoslavia and the undefined borders of Serbia, particularly concerning the status of Montenegro and Kosovo. Hence a democratic transformation within Serbia is essential for regional stability: unfortunately the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coup of 2000 did not fulfil whatever tentative promise it held in this regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The principal parties to that coup were the nationalist opposition (typified by President Kostunica) in alliance with former Milosevic loyalists who remained committed to the nationalist and criminal agendas typical of the Milosevic period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The influence of progressive and liberal elements was always secondary and was eclipsed following the assassination of Prime Minister Djindic in March 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindic's policies of political reform were typified in particular by his realisation of the importance of Serbia's co-operation with the Hague tribunal, both for its own sake and also as essential to allowing Serbia's reintegration into the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Djindic's assassination, Milosevic's Greater Serbia policies are being resurrected, typified by policy towards Montenegro, Vojvodina, Kosovo and the Republika Srpska, by the renewed dominant influence of promoters of ultranationalism, in for instance academia and the Orthodox Church and by Serbia's continuing state of denial regarding its primary responsibility for war crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the army continues as a redoubt of extreme nationalism. Last but not least the new financial elite, spawned by the Milosevic regime or enjoying close ties to Milosevic in person, obstructs a comprehensive transformation of the Serb economy, perpetuating instead a continuity with the Milosevic era legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgrade's policy towards Kosovo is entirely negative: essentially to prevent participation of Serbs in Kosovo institutions, to undermine international engagement and to demonise Albanians; a policy that has to date been successful and that can only lead ultimately to the partition of Kosovo, which would have disastrous consequences for the wider region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only through concerted EU-US action in support of Kosovan self-determination, Pristina and Belgrade may agree upon a mutually acceptable solution subsequently endorsed by the Security Council: that is the only way to stabilise the Balkans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, without a more proactive engagement by the EU, the political dynamics of Serbia will continue to thwart the best intentions of the EU in this direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albin Kurti is founder of Kosovo Action Network (KAN), a multi- ethnic NGO based in Pristina; Sonja Biserko is a founding member of Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia (HCHRS)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The snapshots of this nation are sobering: long lines for sugar and cooking oil, cash machines that dispense no cash, buses brittle from rust, a burned Parliament, a string of looted banks, and the world's perception that Yugoslavs are imbued with a dangerous nationalism that still threatens the Balkans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the larger picture emerging after the defeat of former President Slobodan Milosevic is one of Yugoslavia purging its demons and moving toward reclaiming its place in Europe. There is joy. There is sometimes bewilderment. And there is the belief that the weird and bloody nightmare is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think people abroad now think we're a miracle,&quot; said Dragoljub Milinovic, a veterinary student at Belgrade University. &quot;For 10 years, we've lived the level of African nations. Now our optimism is greater than ever. We lived in a state of complete lies. Milosevic lied to us that we were living nicely. He was fooling us, even when we knew the truth.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If new President Vojislav Kostunica &quot;manages to introduce real democracy here, then the image of us will change,&quot; said Biljana Radivojevic, a university biology student, who would like to see the 400,000 young and educated people who fled Yugoslavia during Milosevic's regime return. &quot;We'll be open to other countries. Young people will be able to travel and show a different face of Serbia abroad. I hope we have that chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task of resurrecting this country of 10 million will be enormous. Kostunica is faced with a ruined economy, political mischief from the last of Milosevic's cronies, an independence-minded republic of Montenegro, and a troubled province of Kosovo, where 35,000 NATO troops still prevent Yugoslavia from exerting its rule over 1.8 million ethnic Albanians and the province's rich natural resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica is intent on guiding his country back into the fold of the international community. He must balance between Serb suspicion of the West - especially after last year's NATO bombing - and the need to open Yugoslavia to world markets. Western diplomats say Kostunica must delicately mend a decade of acrimony and war between Yugoslavia's immediate neighbors, Bosnia and Croatia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fate of Milosevic is a pressing international concern as the West insists that the former leader be turned over to The Hague for war-crimes indictments. Most Serbs believe Milosevic should be tried in Yugoslav courts, not for mass killings and atrocities, but for wrecking what was once one of Eastern Europe's richest nations. Most have no desire to use Milosevic's downfall to examine this nation's complicity in four nationalist wars that killed 300,000 people, mostly civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica told Western diplomats that there was a &quot;very real possibility Milosevic will be brought before a Serb court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The common people are opposed to the West and The Hague,&quot; said Boijan Djuric, a law student and member of Belgrade's student resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But Milosevic should be tried for all those war crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo. We are so embarrassed that that's the only way we can change&quot; how the world thinks of Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The swift events of the last 10 days have stunned this country. Milosevic's downfall on Oct. 5 - as 200,000 protesters massed in the streets and armed citizens seized government offices - thrilled Serbs whose political opposition had been repeatedly crushed by the autocratic leader. Although the uprising appeared spontaneous, much of it was planned, especially the actions of gangs of armed men from the heartland town of Cacak who rolled into Belgrade with a bulldozer, two truckloads of stones, and a van filled with Molotov cocktails. With help from sympathetic police, they captured the Parliament and state TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic fled to his house in the suburbs, where he remains protected by guards. The powerful state police appear to have abandoned him. Members of his socialist party are defecting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The euphoria over the &quot;revolution&quot; vibrates daily across the country. The most popular CD features Milosevic on the cover and the satirical song, &quot;The Last Train for Serbia.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> buttons are sold in the streets. The police are nearly invisible. Each day, the tiny flags of other countries flap from BMWs and Mercedes-Benzes as diplomats return to the capital. They bring good news, such as the announcement that the French automaker Peugeot will enter a partnership with Yugoslavia's Zastava car factory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these scenes are intercut with images of sugar lines, poverty, and the crumpled buildings struck 20 months ago by NATO warplanes. Yugoslavia's unemployment rate is 50 percent. The average monthly income is about $40. Pension checks are months late. The elderly routinely pick through trash bins. Stories of government corruption are endless, such as the looting of $500,000 from the Bim Slavia meat plant by general manager Velibor Tomasevic, a buddy of Milosevic's wife, Mira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At many businesses, workers have forcefully removed their bosses and seized company records. The executives are resorting to serious last-minute housecleaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The management is trying to destroy documents, archives, and all traces of their corruption,&quot; said retired Gen. Vuk Obradovic, a leader of a democratic political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sting of the regime's criminality will be felt in the coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I expect a lot of problems [in rebuilding the country], but the best of this is there is no more Milosevic,&quot; said Srboljub Antic, a member of G-17, a group of economists advising Kostunica's government. &quot;We don't want to lie to the people. . . . We are going to start a campaign soon to warn people of energy shortages over the winter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The biggest issue here is the economy,&quot; said Maria Babic, who runs youth camps to teach tolerance among ethnic groups. &quot;Whatever else the new government does won't matter unless people feel it in their wallets. . . . They can't wipe out the black market because too many people rely on it now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black market, which blossomed under economic sanctions, accounts for at least 40 percent of the $13 billion gross domestic product, according to independent economists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days, the bootleg-CD sellers on Resavska Street are not a happy lot. Kostunica's government is attempting to stabilize the dinar. That has them in fits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody knows the real rate of currency,&quot; said Marijan Stojkovic, leaning on a stack of black-market CDs imported from Bulgaria. &quot;Nobody is buying. There are no dinars on the streets. We just need a stabilized rate. I bought these CDs at 35 dinars to one German mark. Now the dinar is down to 22, and I'm losing money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union last week pledged $2 billion in aid. International sanctions, including oil and flight embargoes by the United States, are being lifted. Italian and Greek firms that signed letters of intent during sanctions are planning to open businesses and offices across Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But political analysts here say Kostunica's relationship with the West will be risky. Milosevic's socialist party daily attacks Kostunica's coalition as &quot;traitors and spies&quot; of NATO and the West. The Yugoslav army chief of staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, who has close ties with Milosevic and despises NATO, has told Kostunica not to meddle with the military leadership. If Kostunica, a nationalist himself, appears to anger the army or drift too close to the West, diplomats say, it could incite Serb nationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new government is &quot;carefully choosing its words about relationships with Western countries,&quot; said Srdan Hofman, a composer and member of the Social Democrats, one of 18 parties supporting Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even in his weakened state, Milosevic still casts a specter on this nation. Anger over his regime grows. The turmoil he has caused for 13 years has set a harsh frame for the future. And, according to Kostunica's reformers, the fallen leader still has supporters who can stir trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vesna Hadjivokovac said the events of the last two weeks had made her numb. She is the epitome of the new Serb state of mind. She was an army spokeswoman during the Kosovo war. Today, she is a translator and analyst for the Western media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My suffering is greater than yours,&quot; she recently told a colleague. &quot;I have to explain a logic that doesn't exist.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ONE hundred thousand demonstrators gathered in Belgrade's central square yesterday to demand free and fair elections, and an end to the regime of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;Stop Terror&quot; rally was a major success for Serbia's fractious and divided opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearly 20 leaders representing the full spectrum of Serbia's opposition addressed the crowd in alphabetical order - to avoid squabbles over billing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A similar rally last August ended in embarrassment when opposition leaders gave conflicting messages and scuffles broke out among security teams for rival parties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition rivals have spent months negotiating a united strategy to oust Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Municipal and federal elections are supposed to be held by the end of the year and polls have consistently suggested a united opposition could beat Milosevic's ruling coalition, but a divided vote would give him victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Milosevic regime took great pains to keep people away from yesterday's demonstration. Several buses carrying would-be demonstrators were stopped by police en-route to Belgrade from Kragujevac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, while state television broadcast a &quot;film marathon&quot; that included the Oscar-award winning American Beauty and the James Bond film The World Is Not Enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neither film has even reached Yugoslav cinemas yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Milosevic regime has responded to the opposition's new-found unity with an unprecedented crackdown on independent media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several radio and television stations have been shut down in recent weeks and government officials have filed a flurry of lawsuits in an effort to bankrupt independent media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A barrage of state media propaganda continues to portray Serbia's opposition as NATO lackeys and foreign stooges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State media referred to those who attended yesterday's demonstration as &quot;NATO followers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The challenge for Serbia's opposition parties in coming months will be to stay united as Milosevic pursues the divide-and-conquer strategy that has proven so effective during his 12-year reign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The unity of the opposition is not so important as the unity of the message. We must continue sending the same message over and over again until elections,&quot; said Milan Protic, a leader of Alliance for Change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aside from stressing unity, opposition leaders spoke of a new Serbia reunited with Europe, and an end to a regime marked by wars, unsolved murders, a massive refugee crisis and dire poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milosevic and his allies were accused of &quot;hiding in their mouse holes&quot;, &quot;governing from bunkers&quot; and being &quot;gripped with fear&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The leader of Serbia's largest opposition party, Vuk Draskovic, accused the regime of murder. Mr Draskovic was the only survivor of an unsolved assassination attempt that claimed four lives in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We're here because this life we're living is no longer life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They're killing us, arresting us, forcing us to leave the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our country is now in the hands of killers,&quot; Mr Draskovic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some opposition leaders mentioned the continuing mayhem in Kosovo and warned of embracing the West without reservations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are some who argued that violence could be humane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It cannot. We must normalise our relations with the world, but must not forget the evil that was done against us. We must not trade one form of slavery for another,&quot; said Vojislav Kostunica, the popular leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The clenched fist emerged as the emblem for yesterday's rally. The symbol belongs to the student organisation Resistance, whose members have been arrested by the hundreds in recent months. The group is not a political party and consequently has emerged as a unifying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A massive banner of a fist hung from a nearby eight-storey building throughout the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vladimir Pavlov, a speaker for Resistance, took opposition leaders by surprise towards the end of the two and a half hour rally when he made them promise &quot;Never again, while Milosevic is in power will you fight among yourselves, that you will remain united in making a decision in going or not going to elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the end, you will be as one united clenched fist in the fight against this regime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crowd responded with 100,000 clenched fists raised high in the air.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Vojislav Kostunica inched forward yesterday in his effort to take more power from his defeated opponent Slobodan Milosevic when the Serbian parliament appointed a transitional government to run the republic until elections are held in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearly three weeks after he was declared the winner of Yugoslavia's presidential election, Mr Kostunica's allies won the right to oversee the Serbian premiership and the key ministries of police, information, justice, and finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Yugoslav president, Mr Kostunica's main power is in appointing the foreign and defence ministers and the army chief of staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has kept on the defence minister appointed by Mr Milosevic, even though he is an indicted war criminal, on the grounds that it takes time to consolidate democracy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other key powers are with the Serbian government, which was controlled by Mr Milosevic's Socialist party. A Socialist, Milomir Minic, will be the new prime minister of Serbia, but he will have to act in agreement with his two deputies, one an ally of Mr Kostunica and the other a representative of the opposition Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three-party troikas will be in charge of the main ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This unusual division of power will at least allow Mr Kostunica's allies to escape some of the blame for what looks like being a tough winter for most Serbs, with looming shortages of fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he will get credit for the huge programme of food and energy aid from the European Union and the United States which his election victory has unleashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Kostunica is hoping that the alliance of 18 parties which won him the presidential election will get the majority of seats in the Serbian parliament in the polling booths on December 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The time of this government is limited and so are its tasks,&quot; Mr Minic told parliament. &quot;Its two main missions are to stabilise economic policy and urgently address the economic needs of the citizens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new president is planning to visit Moscow on Friday to thank his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for the important role he played in the transfer of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Russians were the last major state to recognise Mr Kostunica's victory. Although this was derided by many western officials as a sign that Moscow was out of touch, the timing of the Russian declaration was significant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It came a few hours before Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, arrived in Belgrade to see Mr Milosevic and the new president the day after crowds stormed the parliament building and the main state-owned television station. The announcement that Mr Putin accepted Mr Kostunica's victory was a bitter blow to Mr Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic was still wondering about using the army to reverse the result and restore his rule, but at their meeting Mr Ivanov warned him not to try.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In some ways the Russians' action paralleled their contribution during Nato's air strikes, when their special envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, joined forces with western governments in urging Mr Milosevic to accept defeat in the military duel. This too was highly significant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Ivanov also persuaded Mr Kostunica to visit the defeated president at his villa and mollify him with assurances that he would not be extradited to the Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Yugoslav intelligence sources, Mr Kostunica promised Mr Milosevic that he would resist western pressures for extradition, however strong they became.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also promised to maintain stability in the army, which was interpreted to mean that he would not replace the defence minister and army chief of staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some Yugoslavs wonder whether Mr Kostunica needed to take such a conciliatory approach. But the fact that Mr Milosevic still retained considerable power through the Serbian government apparently convinced the new president that he had to move slowly and gradually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact that he took nearly three weeks to get agreement on a new Serbian government, which is still a hybrid of pro- and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> forces, may also justify his caution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Yugoslavia voted on Sunday, one friend's e-mail message from Belgrade summed it all up: &quot;We're all in election fever, hope and horror at the same time. Wish us luck!&quot; No amount of analysis and informed guesswork could have caught the mood better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At dawn yesterday, less than 12 hours after the polls had closed, Zarko Korac, my friend and the leader of one of Serbia's opposition parties, sent this: &quot;It is a cold and cloudy morning in Belgrade, but I see some strange light. Whatever happened, Serbia changed.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, it's not over yet. As I write, both the opposition and the forces of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, are claiming victory, though no official results have been announced. But whatever happens next, Serbia is highly unlikely ever to be the same. Mr. Milosevic has suffered a tremendous blow. He may not be out, but he is certainly down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was clear already on Sunday night, when the riot police deployed in the center of Belgrade to head off potential clashes between supporters and opponents of Mr. Milosevic ended up chatting with the people who were chanting: &quot;Slobo, kill yourself! Save Serbia!&quot; Only a couple of hundred Milosevic supporters showed up, and, dejected, they went home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the opposition saying it has won a landslide in both presidential and local elections, it would seem very hard now for Mr. Milosevic to recapture the genie of democracy that he unwittingly released. Of course his own camp is also declaring victory, but in a muted sort of way. And that is important. With credibility oozing away, the bonds of loyalty loosen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not too late, of course, for Mr. Milosevic to clamp down and send Serbia squarely back on the road to becoming Europe's own pocket Cuba. But with every hour that passes, it becomes more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How did Slobodan Milosevic, the arch-tactician who, until now, had gambled and lost everything except his own hold on power, make such a fatal mistake? He set the terms of the election. He said: &quot;It's me or NATO!&quot; But the opposition finally managed to unite, and it shrewdly chose a candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, who could not be tarred as a tool of NATO. (There is no film of him kissing Madeleine Albright's hand.) This turned the tables. The question became: Mr. Milosevic or someone else? And more people than ever before have chosen someone else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In part this is thanks to the students from the Otpor (Resistance) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who trudged the highways and byways of Serbia, quietly mobilizing people against their president. Many political commentators in the West dismissed this sort of challenge to Mr. Milosevic, saying dictators are not removed through the ballot box. But that is to misunderstand the nature of Mr. Milosevic and to fall prey to our own Western rhetoric of Serbian tyranny and dictatorship. For Serbs, Mr. Milosevic is an authoritarian ruler, but not a tyrant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shooting Albanians or Muslims may be one thing, but Mr. Milosevic has not been shooting young Serbs, at least as of yesterday. Thousands have been detained, beaten and intimidated. Newspapers have been shut down, and one brave journalist, Miroslav Filipovic, is in prison. But there is no Serbian gulag, and there are no mass graves of young Serbs who have raised their voices against Mr. Milosevic. Whatever he does now, and unless he does start shooting people, it is equally unlikely that Otpor and the opposition will give up the struggle until he is gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, what if Mr. Milosevic is indeed on the way out?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the issue of independence for Montenegro would fade away, since most Montenegrins are not anti-Yugoslav as much as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question of Kosovo would not, but with Mr. Kostunica at its head, a new Serbia would argue with words, not bullets, that Kosovo belonged to Serbia. That would be bad news for Kosovo's Albanians, who want independence and for whom Mr. Milosevic, an indicted war criminal with whom no one could be expected to talk, has therefore been an asset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And for Serbia itself, for the heartland? It is now a disaster zone economically and socially, not helped by 78 days of NATO bombing, of course, but a catastrophe primarily of Mr. Milosevic's making. The last 10 years of war, sanctions and isolation have knocked Serbia back to an extraordinary degree. Huge problems remain to be solved, both among the Serbs and between Serbs and their neighbors. But it seems clear that there is reason for hope and that Zarko Korac is right: Something has changed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob Stewart was a famous actor for 16 years before he realized it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was an unemployed writer/director $6,000 in debt when he started going on auditions in his late 20s, hoping to land a role that might fund his other projects. In 1990, he tried out for a new show called Sweating Bullets, what he calls &quot;a B-version Magnum, P.I.&quot; about a Don Juan detective named Nick Slaughter who solves local crimes in the fictional Florida beach town of Key Mariah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stewart, who couldn't afford a haircut at the time and had a &quot;lion mane of hair,&quot; showed up in a tank top and jeans and had what he calls a &quot;very bad audition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I accidentally went out drinking the night before,&quot; Stewart, now 50, says on the phone from the Calgary set of Heartland, a drama about life on a horse ranch.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His tryout was so bad that when producer Peter Locke and writer/creator Sam Egan watched his tape, they almost immediately began fast forwarding. Then Locke's wife walked by and Stewart caught her eye. &quot;That's your guy,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After landing the job, the first thing Stewart did was ask for an advance to get a haircut. Locke said no. Instead, he pulled his new star's hair back in a ponytail and dressed him in a permanently unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt to show off his chest hair. Nick Slaughter was born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Slaughter never failed to solve the crime and bed the dame, his approach was nowhere near as smooth as Tom Magnum's. Stewart hammed up the one-liners the show's writers served up each week, delivering them in a &quot;lazy Canadian version of Groucho Marx.&quot; Bullets aired for three seasons in Canada and in the United States on CBS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that would have been that. But in the summer of 1992, following Yugoslavia's breakup under Slobodan Milosevic, Bullets aired in Serbia and the series, known abroad as Tropical Heat, took on a second life. The UN had just imposed sanctions on Serbia, isolating the newly landlocked country and shrinking its economy. Robert Nemecek, the programming director for a then-new local television channel called TV Politika, was looking for a &quot;positive, sunny and colourful&quot; series to buoy the spirits of Serbs who could no longer summer on the Croatian coast. He wanted Baywatch, the most popular beach-set series at the time, but it was too expensive. Then Tropical Heat landed on his desk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First of all, it was the light entertainment needed for an audience bombarded with pictures of war,&quot; Nemecek said via email. &quot;Second, it was Rob's face - he had the face of a Serbian!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An embargo prohibited large companies from making new deals with Serbian programmers, but independent distributors had free rein. Between 1993 and 1997, Heat aired on three other channels besides TV Politika. Thanks to contracts signed before Yugoslavia's split, shows such as Twin Peaks and Beverly Hills 90210, along with pirated satellite series such as Melrose Place, The X-Files and L.A. Law, continued to air as well. But Tropical Heat was up to the competition. The series was a hit, and Stewart a star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milos Djuricic, an actor from Belgrade who recently co-starred with John Cusack in The Raven, was eight when Tropical Heat first aired in his native country. In the new documentary Slaughter Nick for President, which explores Tropical Heat's unlikely popularity in Serbia, Djuricic tells Stewart the show was one of the reasons he got into acting, &quot;not because of very good production or very good acting, but (because) at that time I wanted to be in that paradise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many Serbs, the appeal of the show was purely escapist. But eventually the series' second life took a strange turn: Nick Slaughter became a hero, of sorts, to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Nov. 17, 1996, mass protests broke out in the country in response to Milosevic's attempt to manipulate local elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests took place throughout Serbia, but were at their most concentrated in Belgrade where, in the suburb of Zarkovo, sometime in the mid-'90s, a young graffiti artist had written a rhyme that means, &quot;Nick Slaughter, Zarkovo hails you.&quot; According to Marc Vespi, director of Slaughter Nick for President, this graffiti (which survives to this day) inspired student protesters with &quot;the idea of running Nick Slaughter for president.&quot; Soon rhyming slogans started showing up on protesters' banners and badges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a kind of mock-campaign, the message of which was, even a fictitious TV detective would make a better president than Milosevic,&quot; said Vespi via email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djuricic, the actor, notes that humour was the protesters' weapon of choice during their three-month peaceful protest against Milosevic. &quot;That was the weapon the regime couldn't fight,&quot; he says in Slaughter Nick. &quot;We knew that it was our joke and they didn't understand what our joke meant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timofejev Aleksandar, general manager and editor in chief of Belgrade's radio and TV broadcaster Studio B, covered the demonstrations as a young journalist for the independent radio station B92.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those were demonstrations during the autumn and winter when it was very cold here in Belgrade - it was -10 or -20 degrees,&quot; Aleksandar says on the phone from Serbia. &quot;Every day people were on the street and a lot of them needed to have some kind of levity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 1997, Milosevic bowed to the opposition. That same year, Tropical Heat ended its run on Serbian television. Locke's company went bankrupt in 2001, but Serbians never forgot Nick Slaughter. In 2008, fans created a Facebook fan page, &quot;Tropical Heat/Nick Slaughter,&quot; and its ranks eventually swelled to more than 20,000 members, most of them Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two months after the page was established, Nick Slaughter himself stumbled upon it. At the time, Stewart, again unemployed and living with his son and parents, had joined Facebook to communicate with his wife, a cinematographer working in Mexico. One night he searched Tropical Heat to see if it was airing internationally and might send some residuals his way. That's when he landed on the fan site. He wrote the administrator and got an email back detailing how Nick Slaughter became a Milosevic-era meme. &quot;I'm famous in Serbia!&quot; Stewart told his neighbour. Six months later, Stewart and his neighbour (filmmaker Marc Vespi) were on a plane to the Balkans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slaughter Nick for President, which had its world premiere at Toronto's North by Northeast festival earlier this month, documents their June 2009 trip to Belgrade and Novi Sad where they encountered what the local press called Slaughtermania. Crowds of Hawaiian-shirted fans, front-page news coverage and autograph seekers of all ages with Tropical Heat DVDs greeted Stewart over the course of two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here, you're like some kind of god - anything is possible if Nick Slaughter is somewhere in it,&quot; one female fan tells Stewart in the film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In between documentary interviews, Stewart taped a suspect local TV ad for computer equipment, flashed his chest on a Serbian game show, planted a maple tree in Zarkovo (where &quot;the first seed of the Nick for President phenomenon was planted,&quot; says Stewart in the film), and attended movie premieres and fashion shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, for Stewart, the highlight of his visit was a performance at the To Be Punk Festival with Atheist Rap, a Serbian punk band that in 1998 released the song Slaughteru Nietzsche.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the documentary, Stewart can be seen smiling broadly as the band sings: &quot;You bring us a better tomorrow/ You make peace between nations and people/ Slaughter Nick, Serbia salutes you!&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Democratic party headquarters, workers are busy cleaning up the mess left by a mob of pro-government thugs who roared up in their BMWs armed with eggs, red paint and rocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The windows broken in the attack last week are being replaced, the dried yellow yolk and blood-red graffiti are being scraped away. Soon things will look as good as new.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But inside, the climate of fear is palpable. Just when Slobodan Milosevic's opponents thought things couldn't get worse, the UN war crimes tribunal indicted the Yugoslav president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the opposition fears yet another crackdown and even more erosion in its already-ebbing support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A wounded lion is the most dangerous,&quot; said Slobodan Vuksanovic, a spokesman for the Democratic party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teetering on a tightrope, opposition parties hurried to join Milosevic's allies yesterday in condemning the indictment of the Yugoslav leader and four senior officials for war crimes in Kosovo, including forced deportations and murders of ethnic Albanians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PEACE PROCESS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some accused the war crimes tribunal of having a political agenda and said the indictments would set back the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things were already grim for Serbia's fledgling opposition when the indictments were announced Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NATO bombings had given Milosevic's autocratic government an opportunity to curb the pro-democracy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and independent media. The government imposed censorship and closed down the main independent radio station, B-92.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few people complained. Intent on survival, enveloped in a bunker mentality, Serbs have rallied behind Milosevic in the face of NATO's air war, even if they don't like him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Economic problems, war -- all this made him stronger. During hard times, people don't think of politics. They think about food, about money, about finding diapers,&quot; Vuksanovic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People also began to identify pro-Western, pro-democracy Serbs with the enemy: NATO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What NATO has destroyed is an option, a possibility -- the democratic alternative, the pro-Western option in this country,&quot; said independent journalist Stevan Niksic, the editor-in-chief of Nin magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official media have been relentless in attacking opposition leaders who speak out, branding them &quot;traitors.&quot; The leader of the Democratic party, Zoran Djindjic, has fled to the neighbouring, pro-Western republic of Montenegro. The mayor of Cacak, Velimir Ilic, went into hiding after the army came looking for him this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cacak, an industrial town of 77,000 people which has been bombed repeatedly by NATO, is one of the few places where public discontent has bubbled up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Krusevac and Aleksandrovac, south of Belgrade, protests were sparked by what was felt to be a disproportionate call-up of local reservists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military appears to be drawing most troops for the Kosovo conflict from the hinterlands, where soldiers coming home in coffins or anti-war protests would be less visible and politically damaging than in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists are not allowed to travel outside Belgrade without army permission, but have seen no evidence of a groundswell of opposition to Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't see similar things all over Serbia,&quot; said Goran Svilanovic, a spokesman for the Civic Alliance. &quot;I think it's limited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The same mothers in Krusevac, as soon as they have their sons back, they'll vote for Milosevic again,&quot; said Svilanovic, a reservist who was called up when NATO bombs began falling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuksanovic, of the Democratic party, agreed. The protests aren't </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he said. The demonstrators are &quot;provoked by fear for their sons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in Cacak is more complex because the town is run by the opposition. Anti-war demonstrators there are calling for Milosevic to negotiate with NATO to end the bombing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Cacak appears to be the only opposition stronghold where protests have taken place.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HONG KONG -- A China Airlines jet caught fire and flipped over while crash-landing at Hong Kong's airport in a tropical storm, killing two people and injuring at least 188 of the 315 people aboard, witnesses and officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said the plane was on fire before it came down at Chek Lap Kok airport, and the right wing hit the runway before the rest of the jet, which flipped over and burst into flames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passenger David MacDonell said &quot;at about 100 meters [300 feet] from the runway, people at the back started clapping. And I thought it was the kiss of death, and it was.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flight CI642 from Bangkok was thrown off balance by a &quot;hard side wind&quot; as the pilot tried to land the MD-11 during Tropical Storm Sam, said Scott Shih, a spokesman for China Airlines at the carrier's headquarters in Taipei, Taiwan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VILLUPURAM, India -- Sonia Gandhi called in her only son to help her flagging parliamentary election campaign win votes, drawing on what has long been the Congress party leader's strongest weapon: her legendary family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rahul Gandhi, 27, quit his job as a financial consultant in London to work on the campaign. But he is not planning to run for office, the party announced at a rally of tens of thousands of supporters in the southern town of Villupuram. Elections are set for September and October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rahul Gandhi is the fourth generation of the Nehru-Gandhi family to be involved in Indian politics. His father, grandmother and great-grandfather were prime ministers who together ruled the country for 37 of the 52 years since independence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MANILA -- A deadly explosion at the Philippines' main crime-fighting agency was caused when explosives held as evidence were set off by accident, an official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials initially said the blast that killed seven people and demolished the National Bureau of Investigation's special investigation division on Aug. 13 might have been a terrorist attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An investigation, however, showed the blast was probably triggered by agents smoking near a bucketful of dynamite powder seized as evidence, the bureau's director said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW -- Russia's prime minister summoned defense and law enforcement officials to review their campaign against Islamic militants occupying villages in the southern region of Dagestan -- a campaign that has failed to dislodge the rebels despite two weeks of attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting in Moscow came after Russian forces chalked up some victories in Dagestan. They said they had captured parts of a rebel stronghold a day after seizing a key rebel supply route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Control over the Tando mountaintop and the Kharami mountain pass leading to the neighboring breakaway region of Chechnya is seen as vital for the militants. The strength of the Russian positions was unclear, and the tenacious rebels, who are seeking an independent Muslim state in the Caucasus Mountains, have recaptured ground before.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE -- The two main factions of Serbia's splintered opposition said they would pursue their own, separate strategies to topple Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Rifts between Vuk Draskovic and Zoran Djindjic have long frustrated efforts to topple Milosevic, whose policies have dragged the country into four wars that have left Yugoslavia in economic ruin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic's Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reiterated its calls for early elections as a means to put an end to Milosevic's decade-long rule and the country's continuing decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, Djindjic's Democratic Party -- the chief group in a broad coalition of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> groups known as Alliance for Change -- again sharply criticized the notion of early elections. The group said Milosevic offered the early ballot as an &quot;attempted deceit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethnic Albanians resent the Russian peacekeepers, accusing them of favoring their fellow Slavic Serbs. For their part, many Serbs believe that only the Russians can protect them from reprisal attacks by ethnic Albanians.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIRUT -- Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon, hours after two Israeli soldiers were wounded in an attack, Lebanese security officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no word on casualties from the airstrike, the second in two days by Israeli jets. The region, called Iqlim al-Tuffah, is a stronghold of Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas. The air raid came hours after a Hezbollah attack wounded two Israeli soldiers in the Israeli-occupied zone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAIRO -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and estranged comrade Nayef Hawatmeh began landmark talks in Cairo aimed at reuniting Palestinian factions ahead of peace talks with Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arafat, head of the Palestinian Authority, which rules parts of the West Bank and Gaza, and Hawatmeh, leader of the radical Damascus-based Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, were meeting for the first time in six years. They fell out over the Israeli-Palestinian interim peace deal signed by Arafat in 1993.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">INTERNATIONAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A3-9<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Clinton Seeks Meeting To Cap Mideast Violence<BR>President Clinton asked the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, to convene an urgent summit meeting where Mr. Clinton could meet the leaders of Israel, the Palestinians and Jordan, a senior administration official said. Mr. Mubarak did not immediately agree to a mid-week regional summit meeting in Egypt, but said he would discuss it with Yasir Arafat when the Palestinian leader arrived today in Cairo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">High-level diplomatic intervention and military talks kept the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from growing into an even broader and bloodier confrontation, but leaders on both sides braced for a possible escalation of the fighting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A8<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Hillel Lieberman, a distant cousin of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, was found slain near the West Bank town of Nablus. Mr. Lieberman, who had lived in Israel for 15 years, had been abducted by Palestinian rioters as he tried to defend a Jewish holy site, Israeli and American officials said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A8<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Mr. Mubarak appealed for restraint by Arab nations as talks continued in an effort to develop a common Arab response to the crisis. Arab protests against Israel also continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A9<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Scandals Plague Argentina<BR>Ten months after President Fernando de la Rua of Argentina took power, the economy remains in the doldrums and a federal judge is investigating whether cabinet members paid bribes to up to 11 senators. And with the resignation of Vice President Carlos Alvarez, above, Mr. de la Rua is scrambling to save his government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A4<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Forging Democracy in Belgrade<BR>President Vojislav Kostunica of Yugoslavia is struggling to consolidate his authority over Serbia and his own allies, trying to find a balance between revolutionary justice and legality in the post-Milosevic era. His coalition has formed a &quot;crisis committee,&quot; a kind of parallel government to the Serbian authorities linked to Slobodan Milosevic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A1<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Townspeople in Cacak, Serbia, gathered in the main square to celebrate. Residents of the town, one of the most determinedly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> places in Serbia, were core participants in the crowds that overran the federal Parliament last week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A6<BR>&nbsp;<BR>NATIONAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A10-16<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Administration Will Issue Rules on Patients' Rights<BR>With legislation to define patients' rights languishing in Congress, Clinton administration officials say they will soon issue rules that establish many of the same protections for more than 130 million Americans with private health insurance. The rules will set new federal standards for the handling of claims under employee health benefit plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A12<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Spending Bills Pile Up<BR>Congress is trying to cram a session of work, including the passage of nine spending bills to keep the government running, into four days beginning tomorrow. Republican Congressional leaders must negotiate with the White House on three spending bills laden with politically charged issues like abortion, gun control and education funding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A10<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Gore Plans to Delegate Attacks<BR>Vice President Al Gore's campaign is planning a multimedia offensive this week that assails Gov. George W. Bush over his record in Texas and his occasional slips of the tongue, Gore aides said. The strategy calls for Mr. Gore to delegate attacks so he can remain above the fray.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A14<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Many Blacks Back Vouchers<BR>While established African-American organizations have opposed school vouchers, maverick black politicians and community organizers are increasingly the public face of the pro-voucher </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> financed largely by white Republican businessmen. Polls show strong support for vouchers among African-Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A1<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Evaluating the Guard<BR>The last of the 49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard returned home last week, eight months after they were called away to active duty. The 49th erased at least some of the doubts about the National Guard's role in military operations. But its experience also raised questions about how often the Pentagon can turn to part-time soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A16<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Endangered Species Cloned<BR>Scientists at a Massachusetts biotechnology company say they have cloned an endangered Asian gaur and implanted the resulting embryo into a cow in Iowa. It is expected to give birth to the gaur next month. The gaur, an oxlike creature, would be the first clone of an endangered species and also the first cloned animal to use another species as a surrogate mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A16<BR>&nbsp;<BR>NEW YORK/REGION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B1-9<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Clinton and Lazio Agree On Mideast, but Little Else<BR>In their second debate, New York's two main Senate candidates, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio, condemned the United States for abstaining on a United Nations resolution censuring Israel for the violence in the Middle East. But they offered opposing views on campaign financing, abortion, gasoline taxes, potential Supreme Court appointees and public financing for a proposed stadium in Manhattan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A1<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Corzine and Franks Trade Jabs<BR>Representative Bob Franks and Jon S. Corzine jabbed at each other for nearly an hour in their first debate of the United States Senate campaign in New Jersey, attacking each other's records, campaign tactics and stands on issues like health care, the environment and gun control.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B1<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Officer Accused of Rape<BR>A Nassau County police officer was arraigned on charges that he raped and sodomized a 30-year-old woman after pulling over the car in which she was a passenger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B4<BR>&nbsp;<BR>ARTS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E1-10<BR>&nbsp;<BR>FASHION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B11<BR>&nbsp;<BR>OBITUARIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B10<BR>&nbsp;<BR>SPORTSMONDAY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D1-10<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Champagne on Both Coasts<BR>In Flushing, the Mets beat the San Francisco Giants, 4-0, and in Oakland, the Yankees defeated the Athletics, 7-5, to win their division series.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A FEW years ago I was in a new Indian restaurant in central London. It was early evening, and the waiters were still at their peak of attentiveness. As a consequence, the succession of dishes flowed unceasingly before us, so that we didn't so much taste as remember them. The only thing that stayed on the table for a decent length of time was the carnation in the vase. The food was fast: too many items, too little time to digest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The news at present reminds me of that restaurant. It's an odd feeling for a journalist to have, but it seems to me that there's too much news around at the moment. The Denver school massacre, the Dando shooting, the bombs in Brixton, Brick Lane and Soho, the killer tornado in Oklahoma, the Scottish and Welsh elections . . . In each case, there hasn't been enough time to absorb one news item and allow it to shade our world-view, before the next catastrophe is upon us, demanding yet another emotional response. No time, even, to admire Julia Roberts's armpit, despite the countless opportunities to do so afforded us by our national newspapers. This particular sequence of news, too, has been peculiarly unsettling - unsolved or inexplicable events, suggesting anarchy and things falling apart. (Perhaps one should exclude the Scottish and Welsh elections from this, or perhaps not.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Disasters and crimes, though, are not rare, and so I look elsewhere for the source of this feeling of being sated with bad news. It is, of course, the war: in the centre of our vision, filling the restaurant, if you like, and, so far, staying put. I was arguing the other day that the most extraordinary thing about the war in Kosovo was how remote it seemed. That might still be true to a degree, but I now see how the war has got under our skin. Like a pre-Millennium virus, it has entered our systems software and is eating up all our memory. When we attempt a relatively simply task like contemplating another news story, we find that we just can't concentrate as we used to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What eats up the brain cells is not so much the fact of being at war, though that's a hard enough concept to grasp, but the need to rejig our attitude to towards it every day or so, as new perspectives open up. For we have the impression, at least, of this being a democratic war. We feel that our opinions have been sought throughout; and in truth, the military leaders are beholden to the statesmen, who are beholden to the opinion polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, as the war progresses, it is beginning to sink in that we weren't really asked, just reassured: &quot;Don't worry, we're taking this action in your name; we shan't do anything that you wouldn't like.&quot; We gave our consent, but only on incomplete information: &quot;We'll only target military sites; Milosevic will cave in after a few days.&quot; Now, of course, the Mastermind dynamic has come into play: &quot;I've started, so I'll finish.&quot; But would we have started the action had we factored in the children bombed in a cellar, the studio staff bombed at the television centre, the refugees bombed in the convoy, the bus bombed on the bridge, and so on?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It might be thought disloyal to question the war at this stage, or at least unfair, using the benefit of hindsight, but the just-war theory, though it looks a little tarnished, does encourage scrutiny throughout any conflict. Besides requiring a just cause, a war should involve just conduct, ius in bello, if it is to stay within the boundaries of the just- war definition. Another week has gone by without Nato's asking my opinion, but, had they done so, I should have said that, no, I don't think that they are fighting the war justly any longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Setting aside the morality of using weapons and tactics with the potential for mistakes of the type we've seen, the targets that Nato is now choosing seem to have become more irresponsible and desperate. Destroying Serbian factories, oil refineries and power stations has united the Serbs more firmly behind Milosevic, and will make the eventual return to peace much more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I still remember with incredulity the wistful hunt for an opposition leader in Iraq after the West had bombed the Iraqis into a corner. The experience is soon to be repeated. I received a copy of an e-mail on Thursday from the Serbian Orthodox Bishop of Ras-Prizren, who had been at the centre of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We promoted a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-religious Kosovo. . . Not a trace of those beautiful possibilities survived Nato's bombs.&quot; We might wish to add, &quot;or Milosevic's ethnic-cleansing machine&quot;, but citing the reason for Nato's bombing campaign doesn't, sadly, cancel out the damage it has done. There is talk of the bombing being &quot;justified&quot;, but this argument only works if the Nato violence stops the Serb violence. At the time of writing, we simply have two groups of victims instead of one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The phrase &quot;at the time of writing&quot; is where I pin my hopes. For the first time since the conflict began there is a possibility that something positive might happen in the few hours between writing and publication. If, please God, it does, then the real work will start. Our government has ensured that we have had an easy war. The peace will be longer, harder and more costly - but wasn't that why Nato opted for war in the first place?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The offer fell far short of opposition demands that Mr Milosevic step down and allow a transitional government before any elections. The democratic opposition has said it wants early elections, but only if they are monitored by international observers. Mr Dacic did not indicate the date of the early elections or whether foreign monitoring would be allowed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elections are technically scheduled for 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the eve of the Belgrade protest, 20,000 people rallied in the country's third-largest city Nis, chanting &quot;resignations, resignations,&quot; the independent news agency Beta said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are signs that the Milosevic government is becoming increasingly nervous about the groundswell of anti-government opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Panic has set in among the Socialist Party faithful,&quot; said Nebojsa Covic, a former member of Mr Milosevic's Socialist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to sources close to Serbia's government, the Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, has been under close guard by state security forces for the past week out of fear that he may be ready to turn against Mr Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milutinovic was elected president of Serbia in 1997 and stands accused with Mr Milosevic of war crimes by the Hague Tribunal. Mr Milutinovic began to fall out of favour with the Milosevic family last March when he advocated signing the Rambouillet agreement rather than go to war with NATO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests began in Serbia after the NATO air campaign left the country badly damaged, impoverished, isolated and without control over the southern province of Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaign was launched to force Mr Milosevic to accept a peace plan for the separatist Kosovo province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bogolub Karic, a powerful minister without portfolio in Serbia's government, recently resigned his post, ostensibly because he could not pursue the economic development and restructuring projects for which he was appointed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Karic has been distancing himself from the Milosevic government over the past month, while trying to avoid an open conflict. He is among the wealthiest men in Yugoslavia and his local assets include a Belgrade television station and bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Karic amassed his fortune largely through collaborating with the Milosevic regime. Since the war ended, however, Mr Karic has been anxious to remove his name from the notorious black list of 300 Yugoslavs who cannot travel to many Western countries because of their ties to the Milosevic regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rallies in the capital about three years ago pushed the Yugoslav president to the brink of resignation, forcing him to make concessions to pro-democracy activists. Mr Milosevic later took advantage of power struggles among coalition leaders to back-pedal on all of the deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite this week's rallies, there was no sign that Mr Milosevic was about to cave in to opposition demands. Yesterday, a prominent opposition leader fled Belgrade for Montenegro, Yugoslavia's rebellious province whose government opposes Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vesna Pesic, an official of the opposition Civic Alliance of Serbia, fled one day after Mr Milosevic's prosecutor demanded an investigation against her for allegedly calling for violent toppling of his regime. She could face 20 years in prison if convicted of the charge. Ms Pesic, who was to have addressed the rally today, said the prosecutor's statement was designed to intimidate people from attending the gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most opposition leaders say Mr Milosevic's resignation is a precondition for any reform, claiming Mr Milosevic - who has been indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal for war crimes in Kosovo - is too isolated to lead Yugoslavia out of its unprecedented crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A prominent official of the opposition Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milan Bozic, said yesterday that his party would agree to early elections, but only under international control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Post-war elections are a normal test of people's trust in the government, and we believe that's the only right way for peaceful, democratic changes,&quot; Mr Bozic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democratic Party deputy chairwoman, Ljiljana Lucic, said the ruling coalition's offer of early elections would probably be just another attempt at vote fraud. &quot;We are ready to test the people's will, but under new and better circumstances,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International observers have reported major fraud in all the Serbian elections since 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Washington, the State Department spokesman, James Rubin,when asked about today's demonstration, said: &quot;We believe that the people of Serbia and the people of the Balkans would be far, far better off if an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> indicted war criminal were no longer to be the president of Yugoslavia. We believe that this is a view that is increasingly taking hold in a number of parts of Yugoslav and Serbian society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Rubin added that US officials have met opposition leaders and were encouraging them to maintain unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an apparent attempt to keep people away from today's demonstration, Belgrade police said they arrested a man with a &quot;highly explosive device&quot; and warned of possible bomb attacks at &quot;massive public gatherings&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every empire comes to an end, however, and today the world will be watching to see whether, like the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu ten years ago, Mr Milosevic will be toppled by street protests, or whether like the Chinese, he will send in the tanks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PODGORICA, Montenegro</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the secluded medieval fort of St. Stefan on the Adriatic Sea to the mountainous ancient capital of Cetinje, Montenegro was once independent. Annexed by Serbia in 1918, it went on to become an aquatic playground for the rich and famous, attracting valuable foreign currency to Tito's Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montenegrins have now become restless under the autocratic thumb of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. Montenegro and Serbia are all that remains of that fractured country, and Montenegrins are talking of regaining their pre-World War I independence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have dreams of making Montenegro an international tax haven, or of turning the coastal waters, shrouded by palm and olive trees, into a tourist mecca again, a boat ride from crowded Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberal Alliance, a party dedicated to making Montenegro a separate country, is gathering strength, with its trademark green graffiti evident in the smallest village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As usual in the Balkans, the intrigue surrounding the future of Montenegro is many-layered. But one thing became clear recently: the desire for a better deal from Serbia was out in the open. On July 28, for the first time, visiting politicians from Mr. Milosevic's Government were greeted with hostility, their cars kicked by protesters and pelted with eggs as the Montenegrin police stood by and watched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of factors contribute to the unease, chief among them anger at the cost of the Yugoslav war. The Montenegrins willingly collaborated with the Serbs, contributing troops and leaders, including Radovan Karadzic, the wartime Bosnian Serb leader, who was born in Montenegro's northern mountains. The majority of Montenegrins are Orthodox Christians like the Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the economy is comatose, the few factories dying, the main steel mill kept running with scrap metal trucked over back roads from neighboring Albania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Montenegro is part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, it comes under the same constraints from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as Serbia. The United States has insisted that until Mr. Milosevic agrees to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, and to turn over those like Dr. Karadzic who have been indicted, Yugoslavia cannot borrow from international financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several months ago the Montenegrin Prime Minister, Milo Djukanovic, an economist who favors market reforms, tried to convince the World Bank that Montenegro deserved credits on its own, despite the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his envoy in Washington, Ratko Knezevic, complained of being kept in the lobbies of international organizations only to be told that Montenegrins might be nice people but they kept bad company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently Mr. Djukanovic, who controls the uniformed and secret police here, began publicly criticizing Mr. Milosevic. And he turned against Mr. Milosevic's political ally, President Momir Bulatovic of Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister managed to oust Mr. Bulatovic from Montenegro's governing Democratic Party of Socialists, leaving the humiliated President to hold political meetings with his followers in rundown coffee shops. [On Aug. 6 Mr. Bulatovic's supporters voted to reinstate him, signaling a split in the party.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djukanovic is a long way from declaring an independent Montenegro. But he is pressing for more nearly equal standing with Serbia, even though Montenegro has only 600,000 people to Serbia's 10 million and is far smaller in territory and wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djukanovic does have a strong bargaining point. The Montenegrin port of Bar on the Adriatic is Serbia's only access to the sea. Without this outlet Serbia's exports would have to pass through less-than-friendly neighboring countries. But Montenegrins say the situation has hardly reached that point, and the Serbs know how to play hardball. Still, the demonstration against Mr. Milosevic's lieutenant was the first time that an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally was sanctioned here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Montenegro is to gain greater status in relation to Serbia, it must improve its economy. One way might be to restore the grandeur of once glamorous coastal resorts. Fashionable guests -- Jacqueline and Aristotle Onassis, Sylvester Stallone -- are now faded memories at St. Stefan's fort. The visitors these days are of a different variety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our own and the Russian mafia,&quot; said the tour guide at the fort's frescoed Orthodox church.<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Serbia, April 28</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister who had threatened street demonstrations against the Government over press freedom went quietly this evening after being fired by fax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister, Vuk Draskovic, the outspoken and liberal window-dressing for President Slobodan Milosevic's Government, was informed of his dismissal by Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic just 30 minutes before it was announced on Serbian state television, officials said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Bulatovic, a close ally of Mr. Milosevic, said Mr. Draskovic, a writer who turned to politics in the late 1980's and has always been something of a maverick, had been dismissed &quot;because of his public statements against Government positions, and for damaging the Government's prestige.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American and NATO officials had interpreted Mr. Draskovic's stand as a sign of dissent born of the air war. But Mr. Draskovic is not an insider and there are few signs that the ruling circle around Mr. Milosevic and his wife is cracking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a brief news conference this evening, Mr. Draskovic issued no direct challenge to Mr. Milosevic. He said he supported the united fight of the Serbian people against NATO and would continue to urge a negotiated settlement for Kosovo, adding, &quot;I hope Milosevic wants the same things I want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days the garrulous Mr. Draskovic had called on the Government to &quot;stop lying&quot; about the war and to negotiate a peace that would be monitored by armed United Nations troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But more threatening than these suggestions, senior Yugoslav officials and analysts said, were his repeated criticisms of the political parties of Mr. Milosevic and his influential wife, Mirjana Markovic. Mr. Draskovic said the couple had taken advantage of the war to further their own political aims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He stepped over some line with Milosevic,&quot; a senior Serbian journalist said tonight. Senior Draskovic aides were upset by the dismissal, having urged him in recent days to tone down his criticism and limit his interviews. &quot;He got carried away with everyone slapping him on the back,&quot; one aide said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In statements tonight on Studio B, the television station his Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> controls, Mr. Draskovic was supportive and careful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that my country is a victim of aggression,&quot; he said, &quot;I am one of the millions of Serbs who are soldiers of their fatherland. We sometimes disagree about the ways and means of defending ourselves, but we are united and uncompromising in the decision to defend our territorial integrity. There is no crack here and there will not be one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbian state television also announced tonight an agreement between Ibrahim Rugova, an ethnic Albanian leader in Kosovo, and Milan Milutinovic, Serbia's president, to work on a political settlement for Kosovo, a province in Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rugova actually addressed the camera in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, speaking in Serbian and emphasizing &quot;an atmosphere of mutual confidence.&quot; Mr. Rugova, whom NATO regards effectively as a prisoner and unable to speak freely, looked relaxed as he said: &quot;The most important thing is this mutual trust that we have built and the world will salute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had &quot;successfully cooperated&quot; with Serbian officials, including Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Milutinovic, &quot;and we shall continue until we create organs and institutions in Kosovo for all nationalities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously Mr. Rugova could be seen but not heard, with his views being summarized, accurately or not, by an announcer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a joint statement, he and Mr. Milutinovic agreed to form a new, temporary government for the province; resume talks immediately on giving Kosovo &quot;wide self-rule&quot; within Serbia and Yugoslavia, and invite some foreigners &quot;as guests&quot; to attend the talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic, a leader of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests in 1996 and 97, had joined the Government in January, saying both that he wanted to strengthen it during a time of crisis over Kosovo and that he wanted to change it from within.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday evening, Mr. Draskovic said that a military censor had taken over Studio B, an assertion denied by the military and later by the station itself, and that he would lead street demonstrations if military control continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also complained bitterly about spending cuts for Belgrade city, which his party governs, while the Serbian Government faced few cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic had earned most attention from the West for a statements that he thought Mr. Milosevic would permit an armed United Nations force in Kosovo after hostilities ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other officials say the same, although the Government position remains that only unarmed civilian observers from non-NATO countries will be allowed into Kosovo -- nowhere close to the allies' demand that an armed &quot;international security force,&quot; with NATO troops as its core, go in to give ethnic Albanians the confidence to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three ministers from Mr. Draskovic's party resigned in protest this evening. They were the Information Minister, Milan Komnenic; the Domestic Trade Minister, Slobodan Nenadovic, and Milan Bozic, a minister without portfolio who is also Deputy Mayor of Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Komnenic helped foreign journalists come to Yugoslavia to cover the war, the resignations will have little effect on the real power structure, which is controlled by Mr. Milosevic and his wife.<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob Stewart was a famous actor for 16 years before he realized it. He was an unemployed writer/director $6,000 in debt when he started going on auditions in his late 20s, hoping to land a role that might fund his other projects. In 1990, he tried out for a new show called Sweating Bullets, what he calls &quot;a B-version Magnum, P.I.&quot; about a Don Juan detective named Nick Slaughter who solves local crimes in the fictional Florida beach town of Key Mariah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stewart, who couldn't afford a haircut at the time and had a &quot;lion mane of hair,&quot; showed up in a tank top and jeans and had what he calls a &quot;very bad audition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I accidentally went out drinking the night before,&quot; Stewart, now 50, says on the phone from the Calgary set of Heartland, a Canadian drama about life on a horse ranch.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His tryout was so bad that when producer Peter Locke and writer/creator Sam Egan watched his tape, they almost immediately began fast forwarding. Then Locke's wife walked by and Stewart caught her eye. &quot;That's your guy,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After landing the job, the first thing Stewart did was ask for an advance to get a haircut. Locke said no. Instead, he pulled his new star's hair back in a ponytail and dressed him in a permanently unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt to show off his chest hair. Nick Slaughter was born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Slaughter never failed to solve the crime - from petty theft to murder - and bed the dame, his approach was nowhere near as smooth as Tom Magnum's. Stewart hammed up the one-liners the show's writers served up each week, delivering them in a &quot;lazy Canadian version of Groucho Marx.&quot; Bullets aired for three seasons in Canada and in the United States as part of CBS' Crimetime After Primetime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that would have been that. But in the summer of 1992, following Yugoslavia's breakup under Slobodan Milosevic, Bullets aired in Serbia and the series, known abroad as Tropical Heat, took on a second life. The UN had just imposed sanctions on Serbia, isolating the newly landlocked country and shrinking its economy. Robert Nemecek, the programming director for a then-new local television channel called TV Politika, was looking for a &quot;positive, sunny, and colourful&quot; series to buoy the spirits of Serbs who could no longer summer on the Croatian coast. He wanted Baywatch, the most popular beach-set series at the time, but it was too expensive. That's when Tropical Heat landed on his desk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First of all, it was the light entertainment needed for an audience bombarded with pictures of war,&quot; Nemecek said via email. &quot;Second, it was Rob's face - he had the face of a Serbian!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An embargo prohibited large companies from making new deals with Serbian programmers, but independent distributors had free rein. Between 1993 and 1997, Heat aired on three other channels besides TV Politika. Thanks to contracts signed before Yugoslavia's split, shows such as Twin Peaks and Beverly Hills 90210, along with pirated satellite series such as Melrose Place, The X-Files and L.A. Law, continued to air as well. But Tropical Heat was up to the competition. The series was a hit, and Stewart a star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milos Djuricic, an actor from Belgrade who recently co-starred with John Cusack in The Raven, was eight when Tropical Heat first aired in his native country. In the new documentary Slaughter Nick for President, which explores Tropical Heat's unlikely popularity in Serbia, Djuricic tells Stewart the show was one of the reasons he got into acting, &quot;not because of very good production or very good acting, but [because] at that time I wanted to be in that paradise.&quot; The farthest he could travel in the '90s was his grandmother's village, but he didn't need a visa or a passport to get to Key Mariah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many Serbs, the appeal of the show was purely escapist. But eventually the series' second life took a strange turn: Nick Slaughter became a hero, of sorts, to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Nov. 17, 1996, mass protests broke out in the country in response to Milosevic's attempt to manipulate local elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests took place throughout Serbia, but were at their most concentrated in Belgrade where, in the suburb of Zarkovo, sometime in the mid-'90s, a young graffiti artist had written a rhyme that means, &quot;Nick Slaughter, Zarkovo hails you.&quot; According to Marc Vespi, director of Slaughter Nick for President, this graffiti (which survives to this day) inspired student protesters with &quot;the idea of running Nick Slaughter for president.&quot; Soon rhyming slogans started showing up on protesters' banners and badges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a kind of mock-campaign, the message of which was, even a fictitious TV detective would make a better president than Milosevic,&quot; said Vespi via email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djuricic, the actor, notes that humour was the protesters' weapon of choice during their three-month peaceful protest against Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was the weapon the regime couldn't fight,&quot; he says in Slaughter Nick. &quot;We knew that it was our joke and they didn't understand what our joke meant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timofejev Aleksandar, general manager and editor in chief of Belgrade's radio and TV broadcaster Studio B, covered the demonstrations as a young journalist for the independent radio station B92.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the Nick Slaughter slogans and numerous other &quot;humorous&quot; tactics were used to oppose the bleak conditions in which citizens were forced to protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those were demonstrations during the autumn and winter when it was very cold here in Belgrade - it was -10 or -20 degrees,&quot; Aleksandar says on the phone from Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 1997, Milosevic bowed to the opposition. That same year, Tropical Heat ended its run on Serbian television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locke's company went bankrupt in 2001, but Serbians never forgot Nick Slaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, fans created a Facebook fan page, &quot;Tropical Heat/Nick Slaughter,&quot; and its ranks eventually swelled to over 20,000 members, most of them Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two months after the page was established, Nick Slaughter himself stumbled upon it. At the time, Stewart, again unemployed and living with his son and parents, had joined Facebook to communicate with his wife, a cinematographer working in Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One night he searched Tropical Heat to see if it was airing internationally and might send some residuals his way. That's when he landed on the fan site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wrote the administrator and got an email back detailing how Nick Slaughter became a Milosevic-era meme. &quot;I'm famous in Serbia!&quot; Stewart told his neighbour. Six months later, Stewart and his neighbour (filmmaker Marc Vespi) were on a plane to the Balkans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slaughter Nick for President, which had its world premiere at Toronto's North by Northeast festival earlier this month, documents their June 2009 trip to Belgrade and Novi Sad where they encountered what the local press called Slaughtermania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds of Hawaiian-shirted fans, front-page news coverage and autograph seekers of all ages with Tropical Heat DVDs greeted Stewart over the course of two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here, you're like some kind of god - anything is possible if Nick Slaughter is somewhere in it,&quot; one female fan tells Stewart in the film. As a baby, her father played her the Tropical Heat theme song, Anyway the Wind Blows, to quiet her cries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In between documentary interviews, Stewart taped a suspect local TV ad for computer equipment, flashed his chest on a Serbian game show, planted a maple tree in Zarkovo (where &quot;the first seed of the Nick for President phenomenon was planted,&quot; says Stewart in the film), and attended movie premieres and fashion shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, for Stewart, the highlight of his visit was a performance at the To Be Punk Festival with Atheist Rap, a Serbian punk band that in 1998 released the song Slaughteru Nietzsche.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the documentary, Stewart can be seen smiling broadly as the band sings: &quot;You bring us a better tomorrow/ You make peace between nations and people/ Slaughter Nick, Serbia salutes you!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BELGRADE: Riot police yesterday attacked 20,000 opposition activists in the Serbian capital at a protest against the sudden dismissal of Mayor Zoran Djindjic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgrade's first non-communist mayor for 50 years was sacked along with independent television executives in a sordid postscript to last year's uprisings against Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, during which up to 500,000 people staged daily demonstrations in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uprisings and international pressure forced Mr Milosevic to approve Mr Djindjic's appointment and divest his control over the Studio B television station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Milosevic's revenge was sudden yesterday. At a city council meeting, Mr Djindjic was voted out of office by 67 of the 68 deputies present. His own Democrats, and smaller parties, were not at the meeting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assembly also replaced the Studio B management board, alleged to have shown bias towards Mr Djindjic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moves were a stunning consolidation of power by Mr Milosevic, his ultra-nationalist allies and Mr Djindjic's partner in the winter protests, Vuk Draskovic, who abandoned his former ally yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of Mr Draskovic's Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO) yesterday voted with ultra-nationalists of the Radical Party led by Vojislav Seselj and Mr Milosevic's Socialists to oust the popular mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SPO was part of the Zajedno (Together) coalition which led the (northern) winter demonstrations, but the partnership fell apart over spring and summer, a victim chiefly of the bitter personal rivalry between Mr Draskovic and Mr Djindjic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their personal animosities boiled over when Mr Djindjic's Democrats refused to support Mr Draskovic in the presidential and parliamentary elections on September 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Djindjic and other opposition leaders, convinced the SPO would do badly, boycotted both elections amid allegations of bad faith and cowardice between the former Zajedno partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Draskovic came third in the presidential election with close to a million votes and the SPO won 45 seats in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political sources said the results convinced Mr Draskovic he could gather enough strength to challenge Mr Milosevic and the radicals in future without partners like Mr Djindjic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday they said Mr Draskovic had ambushed Mr Djindjic in a bid to establish himself as undisputed leader of Serbia's fragmented opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Djindjic said afterwards he would not contest the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he immediately urged demonstrators to revive their three-month campaign of street protests, which forced the Socialist-led government to recognise opposition victories in Belgrade and 13 other towns at elections last November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands answered the call, streaming into a central Belgrade square with the distinctive deafening whistles that characterised last winter's protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will defend Studio B,&quot; Mr Djindjic said, calling the station &quot;the eyes of Belgrade&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The station had become a free media platform in opposition to the state media under Mr Djindjic, but, hours after he appeared on Studio B, it fell under the control of Mr Milosevic, who has switched from the Serbian presidency to become President of the Yugoslav Federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it didn't take long for it to revert to its old habits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regular news bulletin made no mention of the police action swirling under its windows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Milosevic's swift actions sent a clear message to Yugoslavs that there was no alternative to the autocrat who has used a mixture of populism, nationalism, the army and police forces to become the only communist in eastern Europe to survive the upheavals of the past 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unrest comes as Serbs prepare to vote on Sunday in the second round of republican presidential elections. These will be invalid unless more than 50 percent of the electorate turn out, an increasingly unlikely prospect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country risks a constitutional crisis if Mr Milosevic's nominee fails to get elected as tensions mount in Belgrade over Mr Djindjic's sacking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yugoslav President's flank is also under attack from Montenegro, Serbia's only remaining partner in the federation, which is poised to elect an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president and parliament on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also trouble brewing in Kosovo province, where students from the repressed ethnic Albanian majority have said they want to start peaceful protests tomorrow for the right to hold classes on campus, instead of in private homes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his address to the nation last Sunday, Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski said that the country was a victim to aggression from Kosovo, masterminded by Kosovo political leaders. Clashes between security forces and Albanian gunmen have been going on in the city of Tetovo, in the northwest of Macedonia, for almost a week now. On March 19, fighting broke out 400 to 500 meters away from the city center. A 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew was imposed. Thousands of residents fled from the city that has a predominantly Albanian population. Meanwhile, mobilization of Macedonian army reservists has begun. The armed forces have a strength of about 15,000 but it could be brought up to 120,000. Using the army against militants is a moot point since there is a large share of ethnic Albanians in the army. Great Britain said it had opened consultations with NATO allies on the situation in Macedonia and possible assistance to its authorities in fighting Albanian extremists. The rebels demanded that KFOR units deployed in Kosovo open up the border near the village of Djeneral Jankovic for refugees from Macedonia, otherwise threatening reprisals against the peacekeepers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To understand the specifics of the ongoing developments in the Balkans, to predict their course and the possible level of tension, and to formulate an appropriate policy, it is vital to be aware of two things.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, what we are seeing now is yet another stage in the struggle by the Albanian people for &quot;national liberation,&quot; this time around, however, with plans to involve in the process Albanians living in Macedonia and Montenegro, and to incorporate these lands into Albania. The radically minded Albanians in the province of Kosovo as part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia began their separatist activities hot on the heels of World War II, and have been at it ever since, without a break. Unification with Albania has always been their main objective. The means and tactics have varied but the objective has remained immutable, regardless of the status of the province in Serbia, the amount of funds funneled into its development, or the level of interethnic relations within the federation. There were several stages in separatist activities: nationalist propaganda in the 1950s; demonstrations and acts of provocation in the 1960s; armed struggle in the 1970s; and an uprising in the early 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the 1990s, Albanian extremists had achieved a good deal on their own: They had created a parallel system of regional administration and education, independent of Serbia; established close contacts with Albania; organized procurement, shipment, and storage of weapons both in Kosovo and in areas with an Albanian majority in Macedonia, Montenegro, and in the south of Serbia; on top of that, they had put in place volunteer training programs and created paramilitary formations. It was also critical to draw world public attention to the &quot;Kosovo problem.&quot; They successfully coped with the task. In the late 1990s, Kosovo Albanians began a war for independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, their objective would never have been achieved (nor would their previous plans of Kosovo autonomy, incidentally) without assistance from the United States and NATO, and international organizations that by all intents and purposes supported Albanian extremists. In effect, they helped strengthen the Albanians' confidence that the latter would get assistance if they played on anti-Serb and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sentiments in the West. And the extremists were not disappointed: All documents adopted by international organizations - the May 6, 1999 statement by the Group of Eight, the June 1999 Chernomyrdin-Ahtisaari-Milosevic accord, and UN Security Council Resolution 1244 - condemned not Albanian separatists but the Yugoslav army in Kosovo and Metohija, making demands that Yugoslav &quot;military, police and paramilitary forces be pulled out of Kosovo,&quot; and defining stages for establishing sovereignty in the province: creation of a caretaker administration, to be followed by Kosovo local government bodies outside Serb jurisdiction, and the holding of elections without participation of republic or Union authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presence of NATO forces in Kosovo after June 1999 created what amounted to a greenhouse environment for Albanian extremism. NATO looked the other way as non-Albanians were being killed and Orthodox landmarks destroyed in Kosovo, effectively encouraging the creation of a monoethnic all-Albanian province. It will be recalled that the &quot;peacekeepers&quot; failed to disarm the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army and reduced the Serb territory by setting up a five-kilometer buffer zone on the side not of Kosovo but of Serbia, incorporating into it areas with Albanian-dominated population; that they sought to establish a local administration not bound by any obligations to the Federation or to Serbia, hastened to organize local elections, and opened Kosovo's border with Albania and Macedonia to free </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Choosing an opportune moment, the extremists organized an armed insurgency in Macedonia, in areas with a predominantly Albanian population, following the Kosovo scenario. It is wrong to see this as the work of a group of Albanians from Kosovo who invaded a neighboring territory. The extremist wing of the Albanian political spectrum has long been preparing for this turn, by creating political parties, proclaiming the republic of Illyrida, putting in place an underground education system, training armed units, and spreading nationalist propaganda among the republic's Albanians. It has to be stressed that the Albanian community in Macedonia is far from homogeneous. The bulk of that community is constituted by residents loyal to the authorities who would be reluctant to take up arms. Yet extremists are using intimidation tactics against them. Young Albanians readily respond to nationalist calls since they lack social safety nets, are largely unemployed, and have poor living standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Who will be able to put out the smoldering fire this time? Macedonia is pinning its hopes on NATO. After all, this is why NATO came to Kosovo and Macedonia in the first place. The alliance, however, will not get involved: Otherwise it will have, first, to recognize that its previous policy was a mistake and, second, to risk the lives of its servicemen. Maybe the Yugoslav or Macedonian army? The former has limited room for maneuver and is fully controlled by NATO while the latter has neither experience nor sufficient forces. What about UN? Considering that it ceded its peacekeeping functions to NATO of its own free will, this is not a viable option either. New resolutions will be adopted expressing &quot;concern&quot; while calls to all sides in the conflict will just fall on deaf ears. Therefore, the Albanians have indeed chosen a very opportune moment to act. Unless they are stopped, Macedonians and then Montenegrins will have to part with some of their territory while Europe will have to consider revising its borders and recognizing a new state: a Greater Albania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Single-handed, separate actions will a priori be of no avail. It is only the concerted effort by all European structures and states that will be able to snuff out Albanian extremism. Only the absence of any support from the outside will force the Albanians to back down. Having said that, it is important to understand who stands to gain from keeping the Balkans in a perennial state of tension and what awaits Europe should it fail to act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZORAN DJINDJIC, who was assassinated yesterday aged 50, was the Serbian prime minister responsible for handing over the Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic to stand trial for war crimes at The Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He managed to link this to the promise of an international aid package of $1.2 billion, but even so Djindjic won small affection from his countrymen, who placed him 11th in a poll of politicians. The electorate was put off by his suave demeanour, mastery of the slick soundbite and liking for big cars and sharp suits; he was also a fitness fanatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His pragmatic belief in the need to embrace western economics earned him a half-admiring nickname of &quot;The Manager&quot;; but some labelled him &quot;Little Slobo&quot;, saying that his authoritarianism contained some resemblances to the man he had sent to the International Court despite a constitutional ban on extraditing Serbian citizens. There was some truth in this. He once admitted that he and Milosevic were &quot;ontologically opposed&quot;, then explained: &quot;We all have a bit of Milosevic inside ourselves. We must pull him out by the roots.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic's commitment to free market reforms as the first non-Communist prime minister for 55 years was painful enough for Serbs. When he sought to crack down on endemic corruption and organised crime, he stirred up further resentment, which led him to be consumed in the seething cauldron of Balkan politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The son of an officer in the Yugoslav People's Army, Zoran Djindjic was born in Bosanski Samac, Bosnia, on August 2 1952. He showed a rebellious streak early, being expelled from high school in Belgrade for helping to organise a protest against a law to make Marshal Tito president for life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1974, he attracted official displeasure for attempting to form a non-Communist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with students from Croatia and Slovenia at Belgrade University. After several months in jail he gained a degree in Philosophy and left for Germany, where he did a PhD and supported himself by selling textile machinery and making clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On returning home he found the political fabric tearing apart, and became a founder member of the Democratic Party, along with Vojislav Kostunica, the present president of the much larger Serbia and the tiny, mountainous republic of Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was elected to the Serbian parliament in the free elections of 1990 and two years later, as he acrimoniously parted company with Kostunica, was elected his party's president. When the party took 12 per cent of the vote in the next elections there was talk about his being &quot;Serbia's Kennedy&quot;; Djindjic obligingly ditched his bohemian academic look, cut off his ponytail and donned sober suits and ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the inconclusive election of 1993, Djindjic pursued talks with Milosevic on a non-partisan government of experts, prompting eminent members of Djindjic's party to resign, accusing him of a populist thirst for power at the expense of democracy. The talks collapsed and Milosevic found a Leftist coalition partner. In 1996, Djindjic formed a Zajedno (Together) reform bloc, which launched mass protests after Milosevic annulled Socialist losses in municipal elections. These lasted for 88 days in a row, despite periodic attacks by security police, before Milosevic recognised opposition victories in key Serbian towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic became mayor of Belgrade, but Milosevic sabotaged new reformist municipalities by starving them of funds. Riven by leadership squabbles, Zajedno fell apart in mid-1997 and Djindjic lost the mayoralty in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Nato's 1999 air strikes on Yugoslavia, he fled to Serbia's sister republic, Montenegro, for fear of attack by Milosevic's agents. The state media seized on his departure to vilify him as a traitor and a coward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after the air strikes halted Milosevic's bloody repression of the Kosovo Albanians, Djindjic returned to ally the Democratic Party with 17 other parties and launched another crusade for democracy. A fresh campaign of marches, rallies and strikes fizzled out in the face of apathy and police intimidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the brooding bitterness of a decade of economic decay and international isolation finally exploded in October 2000 when Milosevic refused to admit election defeat to Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic had found his leadership of the party contested, and there were reports that he wanted to abandon politics. But after winning a confidence vote, he returned to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> crusade, strengthening ties with reformist Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Serbia's divided opposition joined ranks in a last-ditch effort to oust Milosevic at the polls, Djindjic - with a modesty that surprised all - insisted on staying out of the spotlight and backed Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On becoming prime minister in January 2001 Djindjic was confronted with the task of tempering the breakaway ambitions of ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo and also negotiating the dissolution of federal Yugoslavia into a loose union between Serbia and the tiny republic of Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He feuded with Kostunica behind the scenes over the pace of reform, and angered his coalition partners by attempting to take control, through associates of mismanaged state enterprises, in the chaos after the uprising that ousted Milosevic. He also demanded summary sackings of police and state security chiefs and threatening to attack ethnic Albanian rebels in a post-war buffer zone along Kosovo's boundary with Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djindjic, who spoke German and English, was the author of three books: Serbia Between East and West; Yugoslavia: the Partially Formed State and The Autam of Dialectics and Subjectivity and Violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is survived by his wife, Ruzica, a lawyer, and their two children.<BR>[PS]News: [ES]</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Dec. 15</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven years ago this winter, the capitals of Eastern Europe were filled with people tossing out Communist rulers and rushing headlong toward the West.  Thousands massed to knock down the Berlin Wall, the symbol of a divided Europe. In Prague, hundreds of thousands packed Wenceslaus Square and ousted the Communist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now protesters are again jamming the streets of an East European capital. For the past four weeks, students and middle-class Serbs have marched through Belgrade's boulevards, in the most serious challenge to the last remaining Communist leader in Europe: Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waves of protesting students tooting whistles and kazoos, and opposition leaders calling for democracy and the rule of law, recall the heady days of the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia, Solidarity's victory in Poland and historic changes elsewhere. But the differences between the political crisis in Yugoslavia and the one that ended communism among its neighbors are numerous and vast. They lead Serb analysts and diplomats from the former Communist Bloc to conclude that the protests here have little chance of toppling Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These demonstrations open the door to democracy for Serbia,&quot; said one Eastern European diplomat who participated in a revolution in his country. &quot;But the Serbs have a long way to go. Perhaps one year, perhaps five.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Communist systems of other East European countries were imposed by Moscow, not home-grown as was Yugoslavia's. Established churches played a critical role in hastening democratic change in several other countries while in Yugoslavia the Orthodox Church has supported the regime. Massive industrial enterprises like the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk became lightning rods for political change in Poland, but Yugoslavia's economy is largely rural.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps most importantly, the people and economy of Yugoslavia have been damaged by five years of war. Milosevic is widely blamed for starting the conflicts in Bosnia and Croatia, dispatching Yugoslav forces to bombard the Croatian city of Vukovar, and grabbing 25 percent of Croatia and half of Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A broad spectrum of Yugoslav society supported the war, which Milosevic has used as a way to co-opt, compromise and corrupt almost every segment of society. At one time or another, all of the opposition leaders have supported the war, or at least Serbian nationalist aims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a country where almost everyone has been compromised by the war except the people who left,&quot; said Jelena Volic, who represents a German foundation here. &quot;When people marched in Eastern Europe in 1989 they had dignity. Here we have none.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbs from Serbia -- not just Croatia and Bosnia -- volunteered or were conscripted and sent to the front. Serbian paramilitary units, backed by Milosevic, pillaged and killed in Bosnia until the end of the war last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conflict, Milosevic's role in bringing it about and Yugoslavia's guilt in supporting it are not spoken of in the marches. But like an amputated leg that continues to twitch, the war still exerts an enormous influence on the people in Belgrade's streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Serbia was an aggressor in this war and we must start with that if we want to really embrace democracy,&quot; said Biljana Kovacevic-Vuco, a former judge on the Serbian supreme court and a representative of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights. &quot;This protest is a first step, but for real changes we must confront the issue of our responsibility for the war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war has had an enormously detrimental effect on Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Psychologically, the Serbs appear to be a damaged people. Ultranationalism and blatant racism, used by Milosevic's state-run media during the conflict to whip up passions and encourage young men to volunteer, are now accepted coins of political discourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the war effort and U.N. economic sanctions imposed on Milosevic's regime for his role in fomenting Bosnia's conflict, Yugoslavia tumbled from being the richest country in Eastern Europe to the third-poorest -- after Albania and its victim Bosnia. An estimated 300,000 people have emigrated from Yugoslavia since the war began, many of them students, going to Canada and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other factors have added to the difficulties of Yugoslavia's people in toppling their Communist rulers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, Yugoslavia, alone among East European countries, had its own Communist revolution, led by dictator Josip Broz, known as Tito. Communism was not imposed on this country from Moscow, it was home-grown. Yugoslavia never belonged to Moscow's Warsaw Pact and Moscow's influence on Belgrade was much less than elsewhere in Eastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signaled unwillingness to suppress democratic changes in Eastern Europe in 1989, Yugoslavia's rulers were partially insulated from this shift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also widespread support for Yugoslavia's version of communism among many people here. Backed by loans on favorable terms from Western financial institutions -- a present for keeping Moscow at arm's length -- Tito provided his people with the highest living standards in Eastern Europe. The Yugoslav passport was one of the best travel documents around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Throughout Eastern Europe and in other parts of the world, people treated us like kings,&quot; recalled Ilija Djukic, a former foreign minister of Yugoslavia and longtime diplomat. &quot;It wasn't so easy for us to get rid of a collapsed system because it was our system,&quot; he added. &quot;Communism for us wasn't an import. That wasn't the case in Hungary, Poland and the others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic came to power in Yugoslavia in 1987 during the Gorbachev era. Calling his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;the anti-bureaucratic revolution,&quot; Milosevic carefully packaged himself as both crusading reformer and nationalist. Soon he turned toward war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With him, we missed the democracy train in 1990,&quot; Djukic said. &quot;Milosevic used the war as a pretext to stop further changes and to gradually re-create something we all thought of as the past: an autocratic system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Poland, East Germany and Czechoslovakia, the Catholic and Protestant churches played a critical role in pushing political change, but here the dominant Orthodox Church only bolstered Milosevic. Patriarch Pavle, the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, refused to meet with protesting students last week and issued statements dissociating himself from politics. During the war, the Serbian church routinely blessed Serb soldiers and paramilitary gunmen before they left for the front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests in Belgrade are further hampered by the unwillingness or failure of Together, an opposition coalition of five parties, to widen its appeal. Since the protests started, the number of marchers has reached 100,000 only a few times. The marchers remain largely middle-class, well-educated and urban. Few workers participate in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And students, who undertake parallel demonstrations each day, have refused to merge their marches into the coalition's.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most potent opposition to President Slobodan Milosevic has emerged not in Belgrade, the capital, but in provincial Serbian cities where dissident mayors and local officials say they can topple the Yugoslav leader. But they need help from the West, they say, and now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They don't want guns. They want bridges. And transmitters, cement, transformers, ferries and, most important, oil and diesel fuel to keep their citizens from freezing next winter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You Americans want to get rid of Milosevic? So do we,&quot; said Nenad Canak, a leader of the League of Social Democrats here in Novi Sad, a Danube River city 50 miles northwest of Belgrade. &quot;You get me a bridge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By this, Canak and other urban opposition leaders mean they need to show voters that the West does not hate them and that they do not need Milosevic to rebuild their bombed-out bridges and ruined economy, in which average salaries have plummeted to about $ 50 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the United States and other NATO nations have declared that, while they will provide humanitarian aid to Serbia--the dominant Yugoslav republic--they will not spend any money rebuilding its bomb-blasted infrastructure as long as Milosevic remains president of the Yugoslav federation, which also comprises Serbia's disaffected sister republic, Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canak, and the mayors of some of the largest cities in Serbia, say the West is missing an opportunity to challenge Milosevic. Seven years of sanctions did not work, but &quot;strategic help&quot; could, they say, and the West should find a way to funnel money directly to opposition-run cities--through humanitarian groups, Montenegrin banks or simply by sending materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm thinking of something like a sister cities program,&quot; said Zoran Zivkovic, the mayor of Nis, another major Serbian city 120 miles southeast of Belgrade, capital of both Serbia and Yugoslavia. Zivkovic has a list of what he wants. At the top is 20,000 tons of heating oil. Without it, about a third of his city--90,000 residents who rely on &quot;remote heat&quot; from city steam plants--will have to do without. He estimates the heating oil would cost about $ 1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zivkovic said that since NATO spent about $ 50 million a day to bomb Serbia, &quot;this is a reasonable request.&quot; He suggested that some U.S. or European city could donate it. It would be a lifesaver, Zivkovic says, and a powerful political tool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goran Matic, a government minister close to Milosevic, called the opposition scheme &quot;pure stupidity&quot; and an attempt by the West to blackmail Serbia with offers of aid if only the people would remove Milosevic. The opposition leaders are dreaming, he added, if they really believe the West will help them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as in the United States, where local politicians can amass power and support by mending potholes, the opposition here wants to prove that the West supports those who question Milosevic. &quot;We're not asking for help ousting him, that is our job,&quot; said Vuk Obradovic, a former Yugoslav army general and now leader of a small opposition party. &quot;But we need to show the people something real, something they can see with their own eyes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ognjen Pribicevic, a strategist with the opposition Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was more straightforward: &quot;We can't rebuild the country with shovels and slogans. We need foreign money and investment. Lots of it. The longer we remain in a cage, the worse for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milan S. Protic, an intellectual who also wants to see Milosevic removed, said city halls around Serbia have tremendous power. &quot;These people made a difference under most difficult times, and they're going to win again,&quot; he said. &quot;The West should show them a sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NATO alliance and much of the Western media have often portrayed Serbia as united in antipathy toward the West. But most of its major cities--including Belgrade, Novi Sad, Nis, Cacak, Kraljevo and Kragujevac--are run by opposition parties that are calling for the resignation of Milosevic, creation of a transitional Yugoslav government and new elections.  Mass rallies and other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations have already taken place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pro-Milosevic Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, was booed when he appeared in the town of Kursumlija last week. Over the weekend, about 500 army reservists blocked roads outside Raska, demanding back pay. And in Leskovac Sunday, a producer at the local TV station locked himself in the studio during the broadcast of the Yugoslav-German basketball game and urged the resignation of the district administrator, a member of Milosevic's Socialist Party. On Monday, thousands of chanting protesters took to the streets of Leskovac to support the technician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic has been calling for national unity on reconstruction and is promising, for example, to rebuild a bombed Novi Sad bridge in the next 30 days. But Canak and his allies want to beat him to the punch--and snatch the credit. Forgoing the stiff rhetoric of some of his more academic colleagues, Canak sat one recent night at Novi Sad city hall, dreaming of his bridge. He said he was promised about $ 10 million--by &quot;people in Vienna, and I can't say exactly who&quot;--and a team of Austrian engineers to build a temporary bridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a rally in Novi Sad Friday, Canak told several thousand protesters that the engineers were denied visas by the Milosevic government. The crowd hooted, whistled and chanted: &quot;Dump Milosevic!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition mayors and leaders say they do not think their citizens would begrudge assistance from the countries routinely dubbed &quot;the NATO aggressors&quot; in state media. &quot;All our cities were bombed, especially the cities where the opposition is greatest,&quot; said Zivkovic, the mayor of Nis. &quot;Now, how do you explain to the people who voted for democratic reforms, who rallied against Milosevic, how do you explain that, well, the Western democracies bombed and killed you, and now they don't want to help you rebuild?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SARAJEVO -- Chief Prosecutor of the UN war crimes tribunal Louise Arbour on Thursday called on all Bosnian war crimes suspects to surrender voluntarily or face arrest by NATO-led troops in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Those who are publicly indicted will be well advised to surrender voluntarily,'' Arbour told reporters, after a meeting with the three members of Bosnia's inter- ethnic presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they failed to do so, Arbour said she was ''very confident that SFOR (the NATO-led Stabilization Force) will continue to discharge its mandate with the same openness that it has displayed in recent months.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peacekeepers have so far arrested 12 suspects in Bosnia. They detained earlier this month former Bosnian Serb deputy prime minister Radoslav Brdjanin, one of the highest-ranking officials to be indicted for war crimes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brdjanin's name was on a ''sealed indictment'' accusing him of running notorious wartime camps for Muslim and Croat prisoners near the northwest Bosnian town of Prijedor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hague-based tribunal has issued 26 indictments against 89 individuals suspected of war crimes, in addition to an unknown number of ''sealed indictments'' kept secret to avoid alerting suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I will be calling on SFOR to complete these arrests and particularly with respect to sealed indictments,'' Arbour said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most wanted war crimes suspects from the Bosnian war, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander Ratko Mladic, remain at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arbour, making a three-day visit to Bosnia as part of a wider Balkans tour, also called on Bosnian authorities to hand over war crimes suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I have called on many occasions and I continue to call on the government of this country to discharge its obligations and to secure arrest of all remaining indictees,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arbour said Thursday's decision by the tribunal's appeals chamber to declare the Bosnian war an international conflict was a ''progress for international humanitarian law.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling means that the 1949 Geneva Conventions, intended to protect civilians in wartime, can be applied to the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a part of a complex decision that overturned the acquittal in 1997 of a former Bosnian Serb police reservist on charges that he murdered five Muslims and Croats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May the tribunal indicted Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for alleged war crimes in Kosovo, along with four other top Yugoslav officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic continued to draw public opposition Thursday. In the central Serbian town of Kragujevac, thousands of people turned out on Thursday for the first of two rival protest rallies to hear speakers call for a united front against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 8,000 gathered in a central square where leaders of the Alliance for Change denounced Milosevic and appealed for an end to damaging opposition splits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO) led by Vuk Draskovic will make its protest debut in the town, an industrial centre badly hit by NATO's 11-week bombing campaign against Yugoslavia over Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two groups have been bitterly divided since they parted ways after huge street protests in 1996 that forced Milosevic to acknowledge their victories in local elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now both say they are trying to push Milosevic out of office, but their continuing split is a major handicap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I am telling my friend Vuk that his place was here among us today,'' Velimir Ilic, the mayor of the nearby town of Cacak who moved to the Alliance from Draskovic's party, told the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There can be no separate rallies, there can be only one rally against them . . . I call on the SPO, the mailed fist of Serbia, to assume the helm of the Alliance for Change.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Obradovic, Socialist Yugoslavia's youngest general and now leader of an Alliance party, also appealed to Draskovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I invite my namesake to join us. We must abandon all petty party interests and join a united front fighting for a new Serbia.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic party chief Zoran Djindjic, whose personal rivalry with Draskovic is at the heart of the split, did not refer to him directly but said this was no time for politicking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There can be no party political gathering now . . . this is a social revolution of a people deprived of their rights.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people in the crowd seemed more interested in the fact the demonstrations were </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> than in who was running them. They planned to turn out on Saturday too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It doesn't matter who organizes the rally, so long as it's not the ruling party,'' said Tomislav, a 25-year-old farmer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A masked gunman entered a Belgrade restaurant at half-past midnight on April 11 and fired six bullets into Serbia's top police official before disappearing into a getaway car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The murder of Radovan Stojicic, deputy interior minister for public security, has remained unsolved, like so many before it. But speculation about who pulled the trigger and why has led to some uncomfortable questions for Serbia. The slaying of the boss of Serbia's 80,000 uniformed police -- a central pillar of President Slobodan Milosevic's decade-long rule -- underscored as never before the government's ties with criminals and war-profiteering businessmen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Belgrade's gossipy political world, rumors variously laid Stojicic's death at the door of disgruntled underworld figures, jealous army officers and fellow policemen, senior members of the ruling Socialists -- and even Milosevic himself. Some insisted Stojicic was killed by high-ranking </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Socialists determined to clean up the regime. Others were sure the president wanted to be rid of a man who knew too much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retired police inspector Mladen Lojovic remarked that Stojicic's murder and other assassinations have served to &quot;rewrite history&quot; by &quot;removing embarrassing witnesses of quite a lot of events of the dark 1990s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rarely mentioned were more logical foes: ethnic Albanians in Serbia's turbulent Kosovo province, Croats and Bosnian Muslims. Over the past eight years, they all had ample reason to seek revenge for the violence Stojicic and his special paramilitary police units visited upon them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regime gave Stojicic a funeral worthy of a national hero, but a reminder of his past excesses resurfaced at graveside. Photographed just behind the president, his son Marko and daughter Marija at the Belgrade cemetery plot reserved for the nation's most respected citizens was Zeljko Raznatovic, a convicted prewar bank robber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better known as Arkan, Raznatovic personifies the government's use of violent convicted criminals in ethnic purges in Bosnia and Croatia from 1991 to 1995 to achieve Milosevic's now-abandoned war aim of creating a Greater Serbia. During Serbia's undeclared wars with its neighbors, Arkan's Tigers -- and other paramilitary outfits recruited among released convicts promised pardons -- were coordinated by Stojicic and his special police units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those links soon encompassed looting, then expanded to smuggling of gasoline and other strategic materials to circumvent wartime sanctions imposed by the United Nations from 1992 to 1996 to punish Belgrade for its role in the Bosnian conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the coded signs that often pass for information in Belgrade, the absence at the funeral of senior army officers and of the president's powerful wife, Mirjana Markovic, was deemed significant. Leaders of the armed forces were known to dislike Stojicic, who last year introduced military ranks in the uniformed police -- with himself as a general -- to rub in his success in creating a paramilitary police organization challenging the army for funds, weapons and prestige.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politically, his brand of radical Serb nationalism was increasingly out of favor, especially with the president's wife and militants of her Marxist Yugoslav United Left party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor was Stojicic universally popular within the police. The rival state security police run by Jovica Stanisic, also a deputy interior minister, resented his powers and unlimited access to Milosevic, according to press reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the killer opened fire from less than five feet with a German-made MP5 submachine gun, under the table, media reports said, was a briefcase containing 750,000 German marks in cash -- about $ 440,000. But veteran crime reporter Jovan Dulovic said police investigators assigned to the case reported they found no money when they arrived at the restaurant within 15 minutes of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The possible existence of so much cash, the absence of a bodyguard and the presence at the table of customs inspector Milos Kurdulija have fueled speculation that the two men were involved in a smuggling deal payoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar allegations have long circulated. Opposition journalist Milovan Brkic landed in the hospital after he wrote an article last October alleging that Stojicic was involved in lucrative drug and car-theft operations with a prominent Belgrade gangster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brkic said two of the gangster's men visited his Serbia's Word, a weekly published by Vuk Draskovic's Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> produced what they said were state security identity cards and took him to their headquarters near the Belgrade airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was tortured for five hours, he said, and owes his life to intervention by the president's son, whom the gangsters telephoned asking for permission to cut off his fingers as a prelude to more serious bodily harm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The war is over, but Milosevic faces a new state of emergency. Milenko Vasovic, in Belgrade, and David Pratt report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surrounded on all sides by resentful ethnic Albanians and KLA soldiers, you might think that those struggling to live in the tiny Serb enclaves of Kosovo would have other things on their mind than the fate of Slobodan Milosevic. Yet even here, as in parts of Serbia itself, dissent against the Belgrade regime is brewing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At this moment we are in a catastrophic political state, and have no friends in the world - the government is nothing more than a mafia,&quot; Jana Dedic, a teacher, complained as she packed a few meagre belongings into her car in readiness for a hasty departure should life in the Kosovo town of Orahovich become too dangerous to stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Across the country, in ethnic enclaves, rural communities and industrialised cities, there are signs that Yugoslavs no longer believe the bombast of their president. With the fledgling opposition as yet scattered, disorganised and divided, it is too early to talk of Milosevic's imminent downfall. But resistance is beginning to surface and mobilise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Down with Milosevic Where is the money? Where are the bridges? Where is fuel? Where is electricity?&quot; read the main banner at a rally in the bomb -shattered city of Novi Sad on Friday. Earlier in the week, demonstrations in the city centre of Cacak drew thousands of people in an enthusiastic opposition gathering - the first since the end of the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbian police prevented a few busloads of demonstrators, and some international journalists, from reaching the rally. Local members of opposition parties also received warnings or were detained for &quot;informative talks&quot; in an effort to get them to call off the protest. Despite this harassment, activists with the coalition Alliance for Change mounted the first open display of opposition since the end of the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Making his first public appearance since going into hiding during the war, Cacak Mayor Velimir Ilic addressed the chanting rally and waded into the crowd to shake hands and greet supporters. He was joined on the platform by Social Democrat leader Vuk Obradovic, Civic Alliance of Serbia (GSS) leader Goran Svilanovic, Mayor Zoran Zivkovic of Nis and civic activists from Cacak as well as Kraljevo. &quot;For freedom, for Cacak,&quot; read posters plastered around the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cacak has been a focus of opposition since its first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations in 1992. In the 1996 local elections, opposition politicians from the Democratic Party of Zoran Djindjic, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO) of Vuk Draskovic and others gained seats and took overall control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it was in the midst of the heaviest Nato bombing that Cacak secured its reputation as an opposition stronghold by organising anti-regime demonstrations despite the state of war. On May 18, local activists organised a citizens' parliament, which held three days of protests attended by thousands of people. After such meetings were banned, opposition-oriented gatherings continued in panel discussions and other private meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The citizens' parliament was formed so the people of Cacak could speak openly about everything that is happening to us,&quot; explains Verica Barac, a municipal attorney associated with the parliament. &quot;We wanted the voice of reason to be heard, to fight for the last man, and not to the last man. But it seems the regime wants as many people as possible to die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the bombing, euphoric nationalism swept Serbia - including officially sponsored rallies in Cacak &quot;against the Nato aggressor&quot;. The municipal assembly, dominated by opposition parties, and Mayor Ilic of the New Serbia party, sought to explain to citizens that such &quot;patriotic protests&quot; were staged by local representatives of the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia and its communist partner, the Yugoslav United Left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus while air raid sirens wailed, and soldiers' bodies were returned from Kosovo, citizens of Cacak condemned such patriotic defiance. Yet with the media blockade, they had little impact. Even the local private TV station, Galaksija 32, lent itself out as the official parties' mouthpiece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In these circumstances, the initial aims of the citizens' parliament were formally apolitical. The focus was on ending the war and saving people's lives. A modest industrial town of 80,000, Cacak lies 100 miles south of Belgrade. The destruction of its economy contributed to the feeling among jobless residents that the patriotic fervour pumped out by the regime and its loyal media cannot offer them a real future. With desperate young soldiers returning from Kosovo, people in Cacak were also under no illusion that the war against Nato could be won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime responded with ham-fisted attempts to stifle dissent in Cacak. The first to be attacked was Ilic, the assembly speaker. Based on statements he made to Radio Free Europe, he wasaccused of revealing military targets. The authorities tried to arrest him, but Ilic slipped into hiding, where he remained until now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trumped-up charges were also brought against leading members of the citizens' parliament for holding unregistered gatherings during a state of war. &quot;The situation in the town is extremely repressive,&quot; says Dr Svetlana Eric, who was also charged. &quot;Only in Cacak were people arrested because of their opinion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within the town, the political initiatives appear to have widespread support. &quot;Serbia is shrinking year by year and its citizens are ever poorer,&quot; says Milisav Kovacevic, an unemployed factory worker. &quot;I am left without a job, and what do I get in return? Bogus patriotism from people who managed to get rich on other people's misery.&quot; He thinks the Cacak initiatives suggest people realise they have to take responsibility for Serbia's future. &quot;Sooner or later the regime will have to answer before its own people,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question is whether Cacak's citizens' parliament and other activities can emerge as a serious new political force. In these terms at least, such protests suggest a hot summer and a hotter autumn for the hitherto uncontested Milosevic, who may have been cornered. The moment the state of war with Nato was lifted, calls for his resignation multiplied. Many came from pre-conflict critics who have now been joined in the call for change by the influential Serbian Orthodox Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But after enthusiastically backing Milosevic's campaign for a Greater Serbia for the past decade, the church is finding it difficult to reinvent itself. The on-going Serb exodus from Kosovo is in many respects as much a defeat for the church as for Milosevic. With more than 50,000 Serbs on the move, the church itself is coming under pressure in what it used to call its holy land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an attempt to salvage something from the Kosovo debacle, the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Pavle, rushed to Pec, home of the Serbian Patriarchate during Ottoman rule, as soon as the Nato bombing ended. He urged Serbs and Montenegrins to remain there, but most chose to flee the town - which had been cleansed of its Albanian inhabitants in April - rather than wait for the return of their former neighbours. As a result, the current </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti -Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> feeling inside the Serbian Orthodox Church does not reflect victory of universal principles over the national interest, but bitterness over Milosevic's failure and &quot;betrayal of Serbdom&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milosevic is also losing the support of older allies who first helped him into power, then kept him there through years of crushing UN sanctions and a string of disastrous military defeats that have turned hundreds of thousands of Serbs into refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dejan Medakovic, president of the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences (SANU), has called for a change, as has Dobrica Cosic, who co-authored the notorious 1986 SANU memorandum which paved the ideological way for Milosevic's Greater Serbia project. Cosic, later the first President of rump Yugoslavia and now a respected newspaper columnist, has urged Milosevic to step down and &quot;make way for necessary change&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosic was roughly divested of his presidency after parting political company with Milosevic over a 1993 peace plan for Bosnia. Years of this kind of ruthlessness are bringing droves of former allies turned foes into the open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We were solving the Kosovo question together with the Albanians,&quot; says former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic, once one of Milosevic's closest friends but ejected from politics by his machinations in 1987. &quot;Others just cut through it with a sword,&quot; he told Radio Free Europe. &quot;The bloody saga has come full circle during the past 12 years and is now closed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have been critics before, and threats to Milosevic's authority, but the difference this time is the sense of public anger that permeates the air. There is a feeling that someone should be called to account for all the lives claimed, homes destroyed, businesses smashed and wars lost over the past few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only the criminal community and the political elite have escaped the economic crisis that afflicts the country. More than half the workforce is without jobs, and those in work have to survive on an average monthly wage of about &pound;30. Pensioners who have only just received their February payments must live on even less. Hospitals are short of medicines to treat the estimated 10,000 people injured by Nato's bombs, while managers of the bombed -out electricity grid reckon that a freezing winter beckons. Families who once got by dabbling in the black market have found even that avenue is no longer as lucrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army reservists in the towns of Kragujevac, Kraljevo, Trstenik and Vrbas, just back from Kosovo, protested violently when they discovered they could not get their pay for their time under fire. Many families had gone without money while their breadwinners were called up. Mothers, sisters and girlfriends in many disgruntled industrial centres like Cacak bitterly resent the way their menfolk - in disproportionate numbers to their sophisticated metropolitan counterparts in Belgrade - were packed off to such a pointless war. Even some regular soldiers have not been paid for months at a time, adding to the Yugoslav Army's palpable sense of fury that so many have died in the name of a cause which was so clearly unwinnable from the outset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the second day running yesterday, reservists - some armed and drunk - blocked roads in southern Serbia demanding payment for service in Kosovo. Similar protests in central and eastern Serbia a week ago raised political tensions in the country sharply, until the government handed out money to demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The unanswered question remains: who among Milosevic's own party will step forward to challenge him for its leadership? No obvious candidate from the ranks of the ruling Socialist Party (SPS) has yet emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Serbian opposition continues to warn Milosevic's SPS allies that they are facing their &quot;last chance&quot; to disassociate themselves from their leader, who has been indicted for war crimes committed in Kosovo by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague. Meanwhile, petitions calling for Milosevic's resignation have begun to circulate throughout Serbia. Under the constitution, 100,000 signatures will force the Yugoslav parliament to consider ousting him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sumadija Coalition is leading the petition drive in Kragujevac in association with the opposition Civic Alliance of Serbia (GSS). In Novi Sad, Serbia's second largest city, three groups are now gathered under the banner of the Alliance of Democratic Parties. Zoran Djindjic's Democratic Party, the strongest opposition party, has also joined the drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Yugoslav parliament, which contains deputies from both Serbia and Montenegro, appoints the Yugoslav president and Milosevic may reasonably expect his party and its usual allies - the Yugoslav Left (JUL), which is headed by his wife Mirjana, and the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) - to resist any motion brought to the house by the petitioners. The Montenegrin half of the house is loyal to Federal Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic, who is in turn loyal to Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If he is to survive, Milosevic must now resist efforts to change this political balance. In the first instance, he has to stop any bid to call an early election in Serbia, which he would almost certainly lose. Secondly, he has to prevent Montenegro from implementing an earlier decision to change the composition of the Montenegrin contingent in the Yugoslav parliament, replacing the existing members with deputies loyal to Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic, all ready to vote against Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to the Serbian opposition, both Vuk Draskovic's Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO), which has been in and out of government, and Vojislav Seselj's SRS now advocate early elections. But as Democratic Party vice-president Slobodan Vuksanovic points out, early elections will only count if they are fairly held under an election law that meets Council of Europe standards and are conducted under the eye of a free media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Things could still thus get much worse before they get better. The other prospect for Serbia is that Milosevic may declare a formal state of emergency. In such an event, all hope of elections would be suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No one in Serbia has an answer to the question of how to force an early vote and tip Milosevic out of power in truly democratic fashion. Thus Milosevic remains in power, still controlling the security forces, the media and the political scene. In that sense then, Serbia is further from a peaceful transition by popular vote than it is from the unpredictable consequences of a state of emergency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The snapshots of this nation are sobering: long lines for sugar and cooking oil, cash machines that dispense no cash, buses brittle from rust, a burned Parliament, a string of looted banks and the world's perception that Yugoslavs are imbued with a dangerous nationalism that still threatens the Balkans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the larger picture emerging after the defeat of former President Slobodan Milosevic is one of Yugoslavia purging its demons and moving toward reclaiming its place in Europe. There is joy. There is sometimes bewilderment. And there is the belief that the weird and bloody nightmare is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think people abroad now think we're a miracle,&quot;&nbsp;said Dragoljub Milinovic, a veterinary student at Belgrade University. &quot;For 10 years we've lived the level of African nations. Now our optimism is greater than ever. We lived in a state of complete lies. Milosevic lied to us that we were living nicely. He was fooling us even when we knew the truth.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If new president Vojislav Kostunica &quot;manages to introduce real democracy here, then the image of us will change,&quot;&nbsp;said Biljana Radivojevic, a university biology student, who would like to see the 400,000 young and educated people who fled Yugoslavia during Milosevic's regime to return. &quot;We'll be open to other countries. Young people will be able to travel and show a different face of Serbia abroad. I hope we have that chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task of resurrecting this country of 10-million is enormous. Kostunica is faced with a ruined economy, political mischief from the last of Milosevic's cronies, an independence-minded republic of Montenegro and a troubled province of Kosovo, where 35,000 NATO troops still prevent Yugoslavia from exerting its rule over 1.8-million ethnic Albanians and the province's rich natural resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica is intent on guiding his country back into the fold of the international community. He must balance between Serb suspicion of the West - especially after last year's NATO bombing - and the need to open Yugoslavia to world markets. Western diplomats say Kostunica must delicately mend a decade of acrimony and war between Yugoslavia's immediate neighbors - Bosnia and Croatia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fate of Milosevic is a pressing international concern as the West insists that the former leader be turned over to The Hague for war crimes indictments. Most Serbs think Milosevic should be tried in Yugoslav courts, not for mass killings and atrocities, but for wrecking what was once one of eastern Europe's richest nations. Serbs express no desire to use Milosevic's downfall to examine this nation's complicity in four nationalist wars that killed 300,000 people, mostly civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica told western diplomats that there is a &quot;very real possibility Milosevic will be brought before a Serb court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The common people are opposed to the West and the Hague,&quot;&nbsp;said Boijan Djuric, a law student and member of the Belgrade's student resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But Milosevic should be tried for all those war crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo. We are so embarrassed that that's the only way we can change&quot;&nbsp;how the world thinks of Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re-writing the nationalist distortions in Yugoslav history books - although talked about in this fledgling age of promise - is expected to take some time. The Serbian spin on the Kosovo war, for example, emphasized &quot;NATO aggression&quot;&nbsp;but never mentioned the ethnic-cleansing and massacres sanctioned by the Milosevic regime. Kosovo is expected to remain a NATO protectorate until Kostunica and ethnic Albanian leaders can negotiate autonomy or other solutions for the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This society is not based on forgiveness. It's based on revenge,&quot;&nbsp;said Maria Babic, who runs youth camps to teach tolerance between different ethnic groups. &quot;Forgiving in South Africa over apartheid was seen as a virtue, but here it's a weakness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The swift events of the past 10 days have stunned this country. Milosevic's downfall on Oct. 5 - as 200,000 protesters massed in the streets and armed citizens seized government offices - thrilled Serbs whose political opposition had been repeatedly crushed by the autocratic leader. Although the uprising appeared spontaneous, much of it was planned, especially the actions of gangs of armed men from the heartland town of Cacak, who rolled into Belgrade with a bulldozer, two truck loads of stones and a van filled with Molotov cocktails. With help from sympathetic police, they captured the Parliament and state TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic fled to his house in the suburbs, where he remains protected by guards. Western officials described Milosevic's regime as &quot;decaying.&quot;&nbsp;The powerful state security police appear to have abandoned him. Members of his socialist party are defecting, including the entire municipal council in Zitorodja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The euphoria over the &quot;revolution&quot;&nbsp;vibrates daily across this country. The most popular CD features Milosevic on the cover and the satirical song, The Last Train for Serbia. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> buttons are sold in the streets. The police are nearly invisible. Each day the tiny flags of other countries flap from BMWs and Mercedes as diplomats return to this capital. They bring good news, such as the announcement that the French automaker Peugeot will enter a partnership with Yugoslavia's Zastava car factory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these scenes are inter-cut with images of sugar lines, poverty and the crumpled buildings struck 20 months ago by NATO war planes. Yugoslavia's unemployment rate is 50 percent. The average monthly income is about $ 40. Pension checks are months late. The elderly routinely pick through dumpsters. Stories of government corruption are endless, such as the looting of $ 500,000 from the Bim Slavia meat plant by general manager Velibor Tomasevic, a buddy of Milosevic's wife, Mira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At many businesses, workers have forcefully removed their bosses and seized company records. The executives are resorting to some serious last-minute house cleaning. &quot;The management is trying to destroy documents, archives and all traces of their corruption,&quot;&nbsp;said retired Gen. Vuk Obradovic, a leader of a democratic political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sting of the regime's criminality will be felt in coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want to lie to the people . . . We are going to start a campaign soon to warn people of energy shortages over the winter,&quot;&nbsp;said Srboljub Antic, a member of G-17, a group of economists advising Kostunica's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The biggest issue here is the economy,&quot;&nbsp;said Babic. &quot;Whatever else the new government does won't matter unless people feel it in their wallets . . . They can't wipe out the black market because too many people rely on it now.&quot;&nbsp;The black market, which blossomed under economic sanctions, accounts for at least 40 percent of the $ 13-billion gross domestic product, according to independent economists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union last week pledged $ 2-billion in aid. International sanctions, including oil and flight embargoes by the U.S., are being lifted. Italian and Greek firms that signed letters of intent during sanctions are planning to open businesses and offices across Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But political analysts here say that Kostunica's relationship with the West will be risky. Milosevic's socialist party daily attacks Kostunica's coalition as &quot;traitors and spies&quot;&nbsp;of NATO and the West. The Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, who has close ties to Milosevic and despises NATO, is threatening Kostunica not to meddle with the military leadership. If Kostunica, a nationalist himself, appears to anger the Army or to drift too close to the West, diplomats say, it could incite Serb nationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new government is &quot;carefully choosing its words about relationships with western countries,&quot;&nbsp;said Srdan Hofman, a composer and member of the Social Democrats, one of 18 parties supporting Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even in his weakened state, Milosevic still casts the largest specter on this nation. His fate is ceaselessly debated. Anger over his regime grows. The turmoil he caused for the past 13 years has set a harsh frame for the future. And, according to Kostunica's reformers, the fallen leader still has supporters who can stir trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vesna Hadjivokovac said the events of the past two weeks have made her numb. She is the epitome of the new Serb state of mind. She was an army spokesperson during the Kosovo war. Today, she is a translator and analyst for the western media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My suffering is greater than yours,&quot;&nbsp;she recently told a colleague. &quot;I have to explain a logic that doesn't exist.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vojislav Kostunica cuts an unlikely figure as hero and prospective saviour of Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While despairing Serbs and Western leaders looked the other way in search of a Balkan braveheart to rise up and cut the chains that have kept Slobodan Milosevic in power for the past decade, the quietly spoken rival for the presidency slipped under the ropes and, possibly, felled him at the ballot box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voting in Yugoslavia's presidential election is now slated to run to a second round on Oct. 8, but Milosevic looks mortally wounded after Sunday's vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if he manages to hang on to power a little longer, his authority seems fatally undermined by Kostunica's strong showing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after the end of the NATO bombing campaign last year, many war- and sanctions-weary Serbs looked high and low for someone to lead them against the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political options were bleak: the maverick fence-sitter Vuk Draskovic and his Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on one hand, and the Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic on the other. Djindjic's error was to leave Belgrade at the height of the bombing, seen as an act of cowardice by ordinary Serbs who had no choice but to stay put.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To make matters worse, Djindjic and Draskovic proved repeatedly that they could not put personal differences aside and present a united opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A series of opposition rallies around Serbia in the weeks that followed the Alliance campaign were little more than Sunday outings for the curious and a chance for the two opposition groups to squabble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this time, Kostunica waited quietly for his moment in history. It came when Milosevic decided to call early elections and Kostunica was chosen to head a multi-party democratic opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas the West had been less than accurate in reading the Balkan mentality, Kostunica had read the runes well. He knew that many Serbs had become wary of firebrand politics and paramilitary adventurism. His message has been an almost Gandhi-esque appeal to peaceful resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So who is the man who seems within inches of achieving what would have looked impossible even three months ago, levering Milosevic from power?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And will he meet the West's expectations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vojislav Kostunica, a married man with no children, was nominated as the candidate of 18 parties and one trade union which form the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in Belgrade in 1944 to an old Belgrade family, he graduated from the Belgrade School of Law in 1966 and went on to obtain a master's degree in 1970 and doctorate in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1970 he was appointed assistant lecturer at the Belgrade School of Law, but was expelled in 1974, during a political purge of Belgrade University, because of his opposition to communism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 1974 until 1981, he worked at the Institute of Social Sciences. He moved on to become director of the Institute for Philosophy and Social Theory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until recently, his main claim to fame was as a bookish academic and author of papers on constitutional law, political theory and political philosophy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica has also worked as editor-in-chief of several specialized journals dedicated to law and philosophy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 1980s, while Milosevic was climbing the greasy pole to supreme power, Kostunica turned his legal skills to human rights and was especially active in the Board for the Freedom of Thought and Speech, where he was highly regarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was around this time that he became involved in politics, becoming a founder of the Democratic Party in 1989. He has been president of the separate Democratic Party of Serbia since it was founded in 1992 and was a member of the Serbian Parliament from 1990 until 1997 when his party boycotted the elections due to the &quot;lack of regular electoral conditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western leaders, however, have been nonplussed. Although senior European Union, American and even Russian politicians have been swift to call on Milosevic to give way immediately and hand power to Kostunica, the lawyer has not always been flavour of the month, especially in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica has consistently proclaimed that he would not hand Milosevic over to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, and he was a vigorous critic of the NATO bombardment. This has been seized on by some as proof that he is no different from other war-zealous Balkan leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica has been described in some U.S. state department background briefings as an old-fashioned Serb nationalist, a sort of &quot;Seselj in coattails&quot; a reference to Milosevic's erstwhile ally, Vojislav Seselj, the ultra-nationalist leader of the Serbian Radical Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is where East and West divide. Opponents of the Milosevic regime see nothing wrong in criticizing the Alliance campaign, as the NATO bombing affected nearly everyone. While they may be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they believe their political destiny should be decided from within.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kostunica is a good patriot. He is educated, a peaceful man and no threat to anyone,&quot; says Srdjan Stojanovic, an independent Serbian journalist who lives in London. &quot;He is a calm, even boring speaker, but he insists on following legal procedures. That is what our country needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what does Kostunica say? His actions and words in the next few days and weeks will be crucial. So far, he has tried to maintain calm on all sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One encouraging thing is the conduct of the army and police, which was very appropriate standing between two political options, and not between the so-called patriots and traitors,&quot; he said on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then promised that, as soon as he officially became president, he would start parliamentary talks on the relations between Serbia and Montenegro. Links between the two republics that make up Yugoslavia have been strained to near-breaking point since the NATO bombardment when Montenegro intensified attempts to break loose of the federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Serbs now fear civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked how his alliance would react if final voting figures show that he has won but Milosevic fails to recognize the result, Kostunica said that he would defend his victory using all available democratic means.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THOUSANDS of Serbs were on the streets of Belgrade last night in an astonishing display of people power which swept President Milosevic from office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protesters set fire to the parliament building, took over national state television, and ransacked the Belgrade headquarters of Mr Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia. Two people were reported to have died and more than 100 were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, addressed the crowd on the steps of the parliament building. He said: &quot;We are living the last twitches of Milosevic's regime. Democracy has happened in Serbia. Communism is falling. It is just a matter of hours. We are staying here till the very end and I am staying with you.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Kostunica held an emergency session of a new Yugoslav parliament and later gave an address on Serbian state television in which he was presented as the &quot;new Yugoslav President&quot;. He outlined his democratic vision for Yugoslavia and called for a return of &quot;normality&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic's precise whereabouts were unclear.Zoran Djindjic, a Serb opposition leader, said on state television last night that Mr Milosevic and his closest associates were in the eastern Serbian town of Bor, close to the Romanian and Bulgarian borders, and that he might be preparing a counter -attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> War crimes investigators said that they were trying to arrest him. Special forces from Britain, America and France are known to be operating in the Balkans and were on alert for any possible capture of the toppled President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Mr Kostunica prepared to address both chambers of parliament, he called on world leaders to lift sanctions on the country, saying: &quot;What we are doing today is history, but history is created by these people. We do not need Moscow and Washington, we are ready to liberate Serbia by ourselves.&quot; He issued a call for &quot;peace&quot; among citizens of Serbia and its neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> World leaders welcomed the collapse of the Milosevic regime and pledged to support the demonstators. Tony Blair said that Britain was ready to begin a new chapter and forget past differences with the people of Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Clinton said: &quot;I think the people are trying to get their country back and we support democracy and the will of the Serbian people. The United States stands with people everywhere who are fighting for their freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He ruled out American military intervention as inappropriate, even in the event of violent repression of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mass demonstrations. He also pledged to move quickly to lift sanctions on Yugoslavia once democracy was restored there. In Paris the French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine, said that the European Union was also ready to heed lift sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Putin returned to Moscow from a visit to India. He would not say if he had offered Mr Milosevic safe haven. He said that violence could have &quot;grave consequences,&quot; and that if it was not checked it would spread beyond Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milo Djukanovic, President of Montenegro, which is part of the Yugoslav Federation and which had boycotted the presidential election, said the last bastion of dictatorship in Europe had fallen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two people were reported killed in the protests. One girl was said to have died when she was run over by a bulldozer in front of the parliament building and three other people were injured by gunfire. About 100 people sustained other injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the streets last night the demonstrators had no doubts that they had won. From first light they had been pouring into Belgrade - miners, farmers, students - from every corner of the country. By mid-morning the crowd, already said to be 300,000 strong, began to converge on the parliament building. At first riot police stood their ground, firing teargas at those who forced their way towards the entrance. Protesters waving Serbian and opposition party flags nevertheless strode on. As the 3pm deadline set by the opposition for Mr Milosevic to stand down passed, those at the front of the crowd stormed past terrified security guards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police fled, some of them tearing off their helmets and joining the protest as those inside hurled portraits of Mr Milosevic through windows and set fire to the main lobby. Some used a stolen bulldozer to smash their way into the parliament as police fled through back exits where they coule be seen discarding their uniforms. Protesters appeared on balconies waving flags to the crowds below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A group headed for the nearby state television headquarters. Within an hour, screens across the country went blank. Journalists working for the Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug also said that they were now &quot;with the people of this country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Orthodox priests last night joined protesters, many of them carrying Serbian flags. Police began to pull down their barricades at the Kolubara mine, near Belgrade. where strikers had given the crucial boost to the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had taken 12 hours for a mass act of civil disobedience to topple a Government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is an unassuming man, barely five feet tall, with a long gray beard and collar-length white hair. Shunning the trappings of office, he rides around Belgrade in the crowded Russian-built trolleys that ply the streets and relishes mingling with ordinary people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the spry 84-year-old, who was born Gojko Stojicevic but now is known as Pavle, patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church, is becoming an increasingly important player in the struggle unfolding in Yugoslavia over the fate of President Slobodan Milosevic and the governance of the country. As pressure mounts on Milosevic to quit, many Serbs want the church to take a more active role.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition groups have asked the church to sponsor a transitional &quot;government of experts&quot; to run the country until elections are held, in the event that Milosevic is persuaded to step down. The patriarch has been invited to speak at a demonstration in Belgrade on Aug. 19 to rally popular support for the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church has already called for Milosevic to resign and is expected to back the proposed transitional government of technocrats and others who are not politicians, church officials said. Serbian Orthodox churches in the United States and other countries plan to hold prayer gatherings on Aug. 19 in solidarity with the rally. But Pavle so far has been noncommittal about his participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an apparent effort to sidetrack the proposed transition plan, Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic, a staunch ally of Milosevic, has said he will reshuffle the cabinet and offer posts to opposition party members. There were no immediate takers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to the pressure, Montenegro has demanded a radical loosening of relations with Serbia in the Yugoslav federation, in effect seeking its dissolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church weighed in strongly against Milosevic in June when its Holy Synod sharply denounced his policy in Kosovo and demanded that he give way to a &quot;government of national salvation.&quot; Allies of Milosevic responded by calling Pavle and other church leaders traitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Serbian town of Valjevo, a top church official addressed a recent opposition rally for the first time since the current resignation drive started. In his speech, Bishop Artemije, who heads the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo, took issue with a rally organizer's remark that Milosevic should be sent to the rebellious province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't send him to Kosovo, for God's sake,&quot; the bishop said. &quot;Send him to The Hague.&quot; Milosevic is wanted there by an international tribunal for war crimes against Kosovo's ethnic Albanian population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Patriarch Pavle &quot;wants to be above political parties,&quot; said Dusan Batakovic, a historian and church adviser. &quot;He will not issue more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> statements for fear there could be a civil war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sermon last week at Belgrade's St. Marko Church, Pavle walked a fine line between Serbian responsibility for atrocities in Kosovo and the Serbs' historical sense of victimization. He denounced recent killings of Serbian residents of the province by vengeful ethnic Albanians and attacks on more than 30 Serbian churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What little of our nation that is left down in Kosovo is getting killed,&quot; Pavle said. &quot;These people were killed only for what they are, not for what they did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wearing a golden crown and holding a staff in one hand and a cross in the other as he spoke in the packed church, Pavle concluded: &quot;We have to face the just judgment of God to see whether we have used the gifts that were given to us by God for good or evil, whether we were torturers and villains or we defended the just cause. Now in peace and unity, we should seek justice and salvation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made the remarks after a ceremony commemorating Serbs killed by Croatian forces during a mass expulsion from Croatia's Kraijina region in 1995. A church bulletin, which listed the names of victims, said 1,791 were killed or missing, including 997 civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ceremony illustrated some of the strains pulling Serbian society in different directions over Kosovo, a province containing 1,300 churches and monasteries and regarded as a cradle of the Serbian Orthodox faith. While many Serbs profess to have been shocked by the atrocities committed by forces loyal to Milosevic, others now revile him for having &quot;lost&quot; Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the congregants were Serbs with a strong streak of nationalism, a sentiment that seems to be shared by some church officials. One worshiper carried a large black flag emblazoned with a skull and crossbones and the words, &quot;Faith in God. Freedom or Death.&quot; A white-haired man in a military officer's uniform said he was a member of the Chetnik </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a nationalist group that has fought for Serbian causes throughout the life of the Yugoslav federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former priest, Zarko Gavrilovic, a staunch anti-communist who once urged the patriarch to excommunicate Milosevic, rejected the accounts of atrocities and said he felt betrayed by the recent U.S.-led NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. &quot;Until this bombing, I thought America was the leading Christian democratic country in the world,&quot; he said. &quot;But now when one mentions America, I get a bitter taste in my mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an earlier ceremony at St. Marko Church, Milan Popovic, a 63-year-old former electrical engineer, said, &quot;I know that Serbs committed some terrible crimes in Kosovo, but I doubt that many others here know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many here, he said he now feels oppressed by Milosevic, but he holds out little hope that the church or the opposition can do much about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't see a way out of the situation,&quot; Popovic said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why are so many west Europeans being such lemons about Ukraine's orange revolution? Every day brings a new example of some feeble, back-handed or downright hostile reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, it was Simon Jenkins in the Times describing the crowds in Kiev as a &quot;mob&quot;. (Dictionary definition: &quot;a riotous or disorderly crowd of people; rabble&quot;.) Last week, it was Jonathan Steele in these pages, responding to my enthusiastic column about the Kiev events with such arguments as this: &quot;Nor is there much evidence to imagine that, were he (the opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko) the incumbent president facing a severe challenge, he would not have tried to falsify the poll.&quot; Unpick that contorted hypothetical if you can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In between, we have two representatives of a pressure group with a highly dubious track record, Mark Almond and John Laughland, informing us that somewhere behind or among the demonstrators were, respectively, agents of George Soros and Ukrainian, anti-semitic neo-Nazis. In the Berlin Tagesspiegel, I read a comparison of the opposition's tactics with those of Lenin in 1918; in Italy's La Repubblica, a commentary suggesting that Warsaw and Vilnius are trying to foist on the European Union a policy of destabilising the region. And so it goes on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For 25 years, I have heard these same old arguments against supporting the democratic oppositions in eastern Europe. Those oppositions, we are told, threaten European &quot;stability&quot;. Behind or beside them are nasty nationalists and/or the CIA. We must respect the legitimate security interests of Moscow (an argument originally used to justify the continued existence of the Berlin Wall). A ghastly Pandora's box will be opened by . . . . . . . (fill this space with: Poland's Solidarnosc, Charter 77, the Leipzig demonstrators - sorry, mob - in 1989, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> students in Belgrade, Georgian rose revolutionaries, or now Ukrainians).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oh yes, and tu quoque : someone else is just as bad, so a plague on both their houses. &quot;Vladimir Putin,&quot; writes Simon Jenkins, &quot;obliterated his opponents in Russia's last presidential election without a peep from the west.&quot; Well, exactly. But what follows from that is that we should have criticised Putin's election-rigging more strongly, not that we shouldn't criticise election-rigging in Ukraine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behind all these contorted reservations, we hear an inner voice which says, in effect, &quot;Why won't all these bloody, semi-barbarian, east Europeans leave us alone, to go on living happily ever after in our right, tight, little west European (or merely British) paradise?&quot; And, quite often, &quot;Why are those bloody Americans stirring them up to disturb us?&quot; For this is not a simple left-right divide. It's a divide between, on the one side, central and east Europeans inside the EU, together with Americans of left and right, and, on the other, west Europeans of both left and right. Not all west Europeans, to be sure. In fact, the EU has spoken out remarkably clearly on the election fraud, through its Dutch presidency and Spanish foreign minister. But many west Europeans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before I address some questions to the Reluctant West European, let me first acknowledge a few obvious home truths. This is a very dangerous situation. There is a real possibility of violence (a little has already happened in the east of the country), and of a painful split between Ukraine's more Russian-oriented east and the more western-oriented west. We must keep talking to Moscow as well as Kiev. And there is no such thing as the immaculate victim. The Bosnians in besieged Sarajevo were not immaculate victims, nor even were the Czechs in Charter 77. In Ukraine, a country with a tortured history of oppression (remember Stalin's deliberate famine, the &quot;harvest of sorrow&quot; in which around 14.5 million Ukrainians died), division and occupation, of evils done to and returned with interest by Ukrainians, that is especially true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ukraine has an appalling level of corruption, involving those on the opposition as well as the government side. Members or supporters of both do have connections to a mob, in its other sense, meaning mafia. What follows an opposition victory will be messy, disappointing to most of those young orange supporters in Kiev's Independence Square, and sometimes unsavoury, as in all post-communist countries. None of this means they don't have the right to try, if their candidate wins a new monitored election which is as free and fair as is possible in such circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now my six questions to the Reluctant West European:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Can't you see the wood for the trees?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You point out some bad trees, but here's the shape of the wood: An election was stolen. Most of the orange revolutionaries want their country to enjoy more of the freedoms, rights and opportunities that we in western Europe enjoy, rather than being tied back closer to an increasingly authoritarian Russia. Wouldn't that be a good thing, for them and for us?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Do you think Ukrainians don't deserve democracy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Please examine your attitude and see if it doesn't reflect some deep-seated prejudices of west Europeans towards the continent's other half, typecast for centuries as distant, exotic, mysterious, dark etc. A good test is to substitute, say, &quot;Spaniards&quot; or &quot;French&quot; for &quot;Ukrainians&quot; in any statement, and see how it reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Are you reluctant to support the orange </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> just because the Americans do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Put thus starkly, most people would say no. But some of the west European unease undoubtedly comes from the fact that American pro-democracy organisations have actively supported the Ukrainian opposition, and Washington does have a geostrategic agenda involving the expansion of Nato, military bases across central Asia etc. Yet the knee-jerk leftist or Euro-Gaullist reaction - &quot;if the Americans are for it there must be something wrong with it&quot; - is silly. Please consider the Ukrainian case on its own merits, not through an American or anti-American prism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Why is Russia entitled to a sphere of influence, including Ukraine, if the United States is not entitled to a sphere of influence, including Nicaragua?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The truth is, neither Moscow nor Washington is entitled to such a sphere. There are hard realities of economic, military and political power with which the smaller, weaker neighbours of great powers have to deal. In the case of Ukraine, this is further complicated by the cultural and ethnic identification of many eastern Ukrainians with Russia. But these are constraints with which Ukraine must deal itself, as a sovereign state. The country of Yalta (a town in the Ukrainian Crimea) should not be subjected to a new Yalta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Would you rather have George Bush or Vladimir Putin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Preferably neither. Given the choice between Bush and Putin, I choose Marilyn Monroe. But it's incredible that so many west Europeans, including Chancellor Schroder of Germany, seem to prefer as their partner an ex-KGB officer currently reimposing authoritarian rule in Russia over a man who, for all his faults, has just been re-elected in a free and fair election in one of the world's great democracies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. If you don't like the Americans taking the lead in Ukraine, why don't we?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To some extent we already are. At the negotiating tables in Kiev yesterday, there was Javier Solana from Brussels, the Polish and Lithuanian presidents, and a senior Russian official, but not, so far as I know, any senior American. And that's right. This is a version of our European model of peaceful revolution, with the aim of rejoining Europe, not America. Now it's up to us to support it, with all the peaceful means at our disposal. These include saying that, in our interest as well as theirs, a democratic Ukraine deserves a place in the European Union. Agreed?</SPAN></P>

Ever day we must be every street and stay there until he (Milosevic) leaves,&quot; Mr Djindjic told the crowd. &quot;We are not here to celebrate victories, but to see how to survive the defeat (by NATO).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the coming months we will turn to civil disobedience, and with the help of (Serb Orthodox) Patriarch Pavle, will establish a transitional government,&quot; Mr Djindjic said to a raucous wave of applause and cheers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Civil disobedience would begin in towns controlled by the opposition, he said. Church bells would toll to call people to the streets. &quot;The police can arrest individuals, but they cannot arrest us all,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Djindjic was the keynote speaker at the &quot;Now or Never&quot; rally, the second large protest organised by the alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No substantial police presence was visible at the demonstration. Mr Djindjic returned on Sunday to Serbia where a warrant for his arrest was issued last month for evading military conscription. He fled to Montenegro at the beginning of the conflict after state television accused him of being a traitor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the rally opened, students showered the square with leaflets portraying a clenched fist with the slogan &quot;Resist&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every mention of the Milosevic family was followed by whistling and shouts of &quot;Red bandits&quot; and &quot;stand up, Serbia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mayor of Cacak, Velimir Ilic, the other speaker sought for arrest by the army, was greeted with chants of his nickname, &quot;Velyo&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They (the Milosevics) have brought the greatest shame and misfortune in history upon our country,&quot; he said. &quot;They persecute people who fight for truth and democracy. As a Serb, I'm ashamed that such people exist. We must drive them out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Raising his voice, he said the Milosevic family should be put on a reservation to be examined by scientists as the last living examples of Bolshevism in Europe. Milan St Protic, a historian, told the crowd that Serbs had followed a false prophet: &quot;For the first time in hundreds of years, we've been shamed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And this anti-Christ government is responsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local police banned the meeting 45 minutes before it was scheduled to begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Electricity for the public address system was cut off, but local citizens hurriedly brought a generator to the scene and restored power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When all those who protect Milosevic go home tonight, let them think about how much this government will cost their children,&quot; Mr Djindjic said as the rally drew to a close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elsewhere, a few thousand people took to the streets in the southern Serbian town of Leskovac, demanding the resignation of a local governor loyal to Mr Milosevic. The protesters clashed with police when they approached a police station to demand the release of an activist jailed there for organising a rally on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ivan Novkovic, an employee at a local TV station, became an instant celebrity when he interrupted the station's programme last week to urge people to rally against the allegedly corrupt local official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Novkovic was yesterday jailed for 30 days for disturbing the peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Novi Sad, the second-largest Yugoslav city to come under bombardment during the NATO air campaign, the city council joined the chorus demanding Mr Milosevic's resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Belgrade, in another blow to Mr Milosevic, Serbia's main opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic, said that under no circumstances would he join a coalition government led by the pro-Milosevic premier, Momir Bulatovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic, who has so far refused to join the Alliance, said that Mr Bulatovic must resign to make way for a transition government. The new premier, he said, should come from a pro-Western party led by the Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic - an avowed opponent of Mr Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Milosevic has been trying to lure Mr Draskovic, leader the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party, into the government in order to create a broad alliance and sideline other opposition leaders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is early evening on Saturday October 7, two days after the storming of the federal parliament in Belgrade. In the coal mining town of Lazarevac, 30 miles south of the Serbian capital, the entire population seems to be making its way to a triumphant free concert that marks Slobodan Milosevic's departure. A small wooden stage has been erected between the traffic lights across the main road, next to the small hotel and cluster of bars that mark the centre of town. An incongruous blend of old Queen anthems, local folk music and Irish dance tunes blare from the speakers as the crowd wait for their new heroes to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First comes the strike committee of miners who have defied the Milosevic police and paramilitaries by closing down the vast open-cast pits that scar the countryside. Arms held aloft in triumph, they are greeted by a middle-aged man in a black sweatshirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is Djordje Balasevic, Serbia's most celebrated singer. During the Milosevic era, he was censored, exiled, and under constant fear of arrest, but his songs became a rallying cry for students, miners and all Serb voters who clamoured for change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, he says, is his first concert in &quot;free Serbia&quot;, and he congratulates the miners and townspeople for making it possible. Then he eases into a solo ballad before bringing on his band of guitars, bass, keyboards and saxophone, for a gloriously emotional show. They start with a protest song, Ne Lomite Mi Bagrenje (&quot;Don't Harm My Acacia Trees&quot;), an allegorical tale which has been interpreted as an attack on Milosevic and has, says Balasevic, become a song of &quot;good versus evil, of youth and suffering, and all those people who have had to leave Serbia&quot;. Then they sing Slobodane, written eight years ago but not recorded until 1998, in time to become an anthem for the student protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The title indicates that the first part of Milosevic's first name means &quot;free&quot; and the second part &quot;no&quot;. Hence &quot;no freedom&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Balasevic's songs have the sturdy melodies of good country ballads, mixed with a dash of blues. The crowd know all the words, and sing them back at him across the square. He's a fine raconteur, mixing the music with long, rambling stories. One ridicules Milosevic's TV appearance the previous evening, and his claim that he was stepping down to &quot;spend more time with my grandson&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milosevic's downfall was partly a cultural revolution, fought out in songs from both sides of the political spectrum. In Britain, the idea that political pop can be hazardous seems far-fetched, but there is a depressing history of political singers being persecuted because of their work. Balasevic follows in the footsteps of Pete Seeger, banned by the US in the 1950s during the HUAC anti-communist witch-hunts; Victor Heredia, banned by the military junta in Argentina; Fela Kuti, whose club was attacked by the Nigerian army; and Victor Jara, killed in the Santiago massacres during the Pinochet coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milosevic also used terror against his opponents, and Balasevic says he felt threatened by the militias and secret police. A &quot;rock'n'roll child&quot;, influenced by &quot;Pink Floyd, the Beatles and electric guitars&quot;, he had already established a popular following across the Balkans by the time Milosevic came to power. Then his livelihood was taken away from him. For a decade, his songs were never played on state television - a situation only rectified after the storming of the Federal parliament. When Balasevic's wife rushed in to tell him that he was back on the air, he was astonished. &quot;I could hardly recognise myself,&quot; he says, &quot;because all the recordings they had of me were so old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the Milosevic years he retreated to the house where he was born, up in the northern town of Novi Sad (a target for the Nato bombs that destroyed the bridges across the Danube). &quot;I didn't dare leave the house for two months,&quot; he says. &quot;I'd been threatened with arrest as a deserter because I refused to fight in Croatia - I have fans and friends there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He spent his time writing four books, which were printed privately and sold from the house, along with cassettes of his songs, and in the later years he was able to give a few low-key concerts, but was never allowed to promote himself or book any large-scale venues. For much of the time he lived as a refugee, across the border in Slovenia, but then began touring, as &quot;I could go anywhere except my home in Serbia&quot;. He travelled across the Balkans, and sang to the Serb communities in Australia and Britain. He kept writing songs, and even managed to keep recording. His last album, Deveste (The 1990s), was the story of a lost decade. The title track dealt, he said, &quot;with just how great the 1960s were, and how things have been getting worse in Serbia ever since&quot;. Recorded secretly in Belgrade and in Slovenia, the CDs were smuggled back across the border. Smuggling became something of a national pastime in Serbia; criminal gangs and border police were all involved. There were, said Balasevic, &quot;so many corrupt police officers, there was no real problem getting my CDs back here&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the past two years, his songs have found a new audience in the student supporters of the Serbian resistance. As the elections approached, they organised rock concerts to encourage the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vote, and plastered Belgrade with their slogan Gotob Je! (He's Finished!). Pirate CDs helped to inspire the students, much to the fury of the authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the best of those CDs, Gotob Je!, features a ripped election poster of Milosevic on the front cover. Four of the 16 songs on the compilation are by Balasevic, including Slobodane and Zveti Slobodno (&quot;To Live Freely&quot;), a song from the Deveste album which had become a firm favourite with student activists and others opposed to Milosevic. &quot;I'd been waiting to sing it live for over a year,&quot; says Balasevic, &quot;and when I did eventually get to sing it for the first time, it was alongside Kostunica at a rally in Belgrade, in front of an audience of half a million people. The students had been using the song, it had been played on B92 (the independent radio station closed last year by the authorities but now back in business) and everyone knew the words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Young Serbs want to tell visitors that their country is not full of Slobodan-supporting murderers and monsters, and that the image built up in the west during the Bosnia and Kosovo conflicts is one-sided. Belgrade is keen to present the image of a modern European city, and English visitors are likely to be quizzed about the Nato bombing campaign (&quot;how could you do that to us when so many were against Milosevic?&quot;), then asked about English football and western pop. This is now referred to, somewhat bitterly, as &quot;Nato music&quot;, but B92 seemed to be playing a solid diet of Pulp last month. The bootleg CDs of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign have proved that home-made Serbian pop is a force to be reckoned with, and can be witty, original and brave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that was just one side of the political pop equation. Balasevic complains that, &quot;far too many of my colleagues simply went along with Milosevic, so they could appear on TV and travel as they wished. If more of us had come together during Croatia and Bosnia we could have done something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then there were the musicians seen as advocates of the Serb nationalism that led Milosevic to his bloody military adventures. Throughout the late 1990s, the musical pin-up in Serbia was Ceca Raznatovic, known as Ceca. Unlike Balasevic, she was constantly on Serbian TV. It was Ceca, says Balasevic, who &quot;provided the soundtrack for the Milosevic movie&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ceca's powerful voice and declamatory, theatrical style mixes the Middle Eastern/ Turkish-sounding influences of southern Serbia with wailing fuzzed guitars and heavy synthesised riffs. Her image is equally brash. For her latest CD, Ceca 2000, she poses in skimpy purple plastic, and blue bondage bra and pants. Nothing dangerously political in that, one might think, but what makes the ruling queen of Serbian &quot;turbo-folk&quot; so special is that she's the widow of Zelko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan. And Arkan was the most notorious and feared of all the gang-leaders and warlords who emerged during the Milosevic era. In January this year Arkan was gunned down in Belgrade, discovered by his wife in a pool of blood. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. A group of men accused of Arkan's murder, including an off-duty policeman, are now on trial in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Balasevic is scathing about her musical standing: &quot;She's a folk singer from the south of Serbia, and folk music was used to boost Serb nationalism. When people get drunk they sing about knives and war. It's primitive music and it was always on TV. Turbo-folk was a kind of terror music, but if it's on TV all the time you get used to it. Now I hope we can forget it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The overthrow of Milosevic has transformed the country's cultural scene. While the one-time queen of Serbian pop attends a murder trial, the singer who suffered the most under Milosevic finds that his life has changed for the better. He can give concerts in his homeland, and is being feted as an international celebrity. In his years in exile in Slovenia he accepted an offer from the United Nations to become UN &quot;goodwill ambassador&quot; for south-east Europe. Last month he flew to New York to take part in a celebrity bash. Recovering from the failure of the Middle East peace talks, Kofi Annan surrounded himself with a motley crew of 40 goodwill superstars, ranging from Mohammed Ali to Geri Halliwell, Susan Sarandon, Michael Douglas, Mia Farrow, Youssou N'Dour and Seamus Heaney. &quot;I was treated like a hero,&quot; says a delighted Balasevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Back in Serbia, he is preparing a victory concert in the capital. &quot;For years I had managed to give an annual show in Belgrade, but I had no media support, so two years ago I said I wouldn't play another major concert in the city until Milosevic had gone. At that point I had played 99 concerts in Belgrade, and I wanted the 100th show to be really special.&quot; The Belgrade victory concert will take place on Monday in the National Theatre in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But are the dangerous times really over? Before leaving Belgrade, I browse through booths of smuggled CDs along the main pedestrian walkway, Knez Mihajlova. Copies of Ceca 2000 are selling well alongside Balasevic and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> compilations. I'm not sure they're home and dry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The smartest idea so far in all the back-and-forth and busy second- guessing over NATO's war against Serbia comes from former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is not surprising. Even a couple of years distant from office, the longtime Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee is still crackling smart about military policy and the tricky places where that blends with foreign policy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nunn is making the point in interviews that in dicey situations like the one in the Balkans, where civil war and ethnic hatred mix, U.S. military and civilian planners first need to unleash not their bombs and missiles, but an aggressive information campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our failure to make it clear to Serbian civilians just what horrors Slobodan Milosevic was committing in their name in Kosovo and the reasonable compromises NATO was pressing for has made the NATO attack seem arbitrary and merely abusive to most Serbians. The effect has been clear in interviews as even longtime </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbs angrily take up with the man they were working just weeks ago to be rid of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO's efforts to catch up now, with the bombs dropping, have obvious credibility problems. The field has been ceded to the manipulative, hypernationalist government-controlled media of Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The democracies, Nunn says, need what he calls ''a new set of tools'' --- in effect, information warfare --- as a potential first resort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basic idea is hardly new. Allied planes dropped propaganda leaflets in World War I. Something far more sophisticated is called for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voice of America and other established means for getting the word out should be targeted to specific policy purposes, Nunn says. Even if that failed to deter an authoritarian regime like Milosevic's, the civilian readiness to see a nasty conflict through would be softened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military, too, needs an upfront ability to press an information campaign itself --- much of its current limited capacity is in the reserves -- - and, if hostilities start, should take out opposition media, Nunn says. The nation's information war ''capacities are not well inserted into doctrine.'' The need is ''to get them into the minds of policy-makers'' as part of any war plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nunn sees NATO's failure first to make its case compellingly as having a potentially disastrous side effect in U.S.-Russian relations. Russian anti- American sentiment is running stronger now, he says, than during the Cold War.  Then, the Soviet government was pushing the people to be anti-American; now the Russian people are pushing their government to be anti-American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless that can be fixed --- perhaps by involving Russia in a solution, though Nunn says that could be a ''migraine headache'' --- populist anti- Americanism could bring Communists and nationalists to power in Russia's December elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO and the United States, Nunn says, have ''good motives, the instincts are humanitarian.'' Those instincts and motives will have a harder time prevailing when they are lost on the very people for whom they are intended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slobodan Milosevic has clung to power in Yugoslavia for more than a decade, thanks to his tight control of the media, the police and the dwindling assets of a deteriorated economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the erosion of Milosevic's position has recently accelerated and his efforts at political survival have assumed the character of a three-front war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[1] A power struggle with politically non-conformist Montenegro. This small republic of less than 700,000 people makes up, with Serbia, the two-unit, 10-million-strong Yugoslav federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[2] An undeclared war with the independence-seeking Albanians in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[3] A confrontation with students and faculty at Belgrade University who have found a new pretext to resume anti-regime protests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the most serious current threat to Milosevic comes from Montenegrin voters' decision late last year to elect a vocal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reformer, 36-year-old Milo Djukanovic, as president of their republic. Djukanovic and his Montenegrin reform team not only advocate pluralist democracy, multiculturalism and economic &quot;marketization,&quot; but they are also harshly critical of the isolationist and neo-communist policies of the regime in Belgrade. They refuse to support Milosevic's effort to expand the power of Yugoslavia's federal presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Djukanovic was previously associated with the Milosevic ruling power structure, he serves as a magnet for both disenchanted regime officials who secretly yearn for an orderly end to authoritarian rule and also for opposition elements who have vainly sought a fresh leader with a coherent reform program. Milosevic has not taken the Montenegrin challenge lightly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, hoping to constrain the Montenegrin reformers, and also to tip the scales in last Sunday's legislative elections, Milosevic arranged the removal of Yugoslavia's federal prime minister, a Montenegrin who had declined taking strong measures against Djukanovic after the latter's electoral victory in 1997. He also named as his successor Djukanovic's chief political rival, Momir Bulatovic, a former president of Montenegro and a Belgrade loyalist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preliminary results from the election indicate a decisive victory for Djukanovic's coalition (taking 51 per cent of the vote, compared with 34 per cent for the anti-reformers), thereby raising the political temperature considerably. Milosevic and Bulatovic may now attempt to covertly destabilize Montenegro to create a pretext for Belgrade to impose some kind of martial law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This approach would add insult to injury and could provoke Montenegrin secession from the federation, which might lead to civil war. Though most Montenegrins view their community as a branch of the Serbian ethnic family, they deeply resent the manipulation of their republic by Belgrade politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montenegrin resistance to Belgrade has been reinforced by Milosevic's strategy in Kosovo where, since late February, violence has escalated between Serb security forces and local Albanians. Djukanovic does not support the demand for independence by Kosovo Albanians or the call in some quarters for the creation of a third &quot;Kosovo Republic&quot; within Yugoslavia, which would be three times the size of Montenegro in population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Montenegrin president blames Milosevic for precipitating an armed struggle by Albanians in Kosovo and favours international mediation of the Kosovo problem - a position rejected by Milosevic and a large majority of Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even without the Montenegrin problem, the Kosovo crisis has become extremely serious for Milosevic. Because large numbers of Kosovo's roughly two million Albanians are now disenchanted with the non-violent strategy of their leaders, the Albanian guerrilla </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the province (the Kosovo Liberation Army) is rapidly growing stronger in terms of both size and equipment. Fighting between the Yugoslav army and Albanian guerrilla forces has already claimed the life of more than 200 civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flow of arms into Kosovo from neighbouring Albania, where the government is not in control of the northern portion of the country, has also stimulated Kosovo's radicalization. Last week, NATO ministers took some limited measures to help Albania and Macedonia protect their border zones to avert spillover from the Kosovo conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many members of the international community want to head off the danger of a general Balkan conflagration. And they are uncomfortable with the idea of assisting Kosovo's secession from Yugoslavia. But there remains mixed feelings about indirectly assisting Milosevic by depriving the Kosovo Albanians entirely of any outside military assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomatic efforts to avoid a violent secessionist scenario have also been intensified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After some arm twisting in Belgrade by American envoy Richard Holbrooke, talks have begun between Serbian officials and Kosovo's Albanian political leaders - a kind of simulated dialogue or a - dialogue about dialogue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few believe, however, that Milosevic, who has recently brought ultra-nationalist leaders of the Serb Radical Party into the Serbian government, will rush to grant substantial autonomy to Kosovo. Indeed, playing the anti-Albanian card is a conventional method used by Milosevic to drum up popular support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But international pressure and the exigencies of the anti-Serb guerrilla struggle in Kosovo may force Milosevic, who personally cares little for Kosovo, to make a deal Albanians perceive as favourable. Should he do so, he will undoubtedly face new and equally disruptive resistance from radical nationalists in Serbia. Ironically, Milosevic began his political ascent by mobilizing Serbian grievances over Kosovo; he now finds that issue haunting his political survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Violence in Kosovo has erupted again. The latest Associated Press dispatch from the Balkans reports that hundreds of villagers fled across the border to Albania Tuesday to escape heavy fighting between Serb security forces and rebels.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic is also battling on a third front closer to home. His autocratic tactics have managed to resuscitate the anti-regime ardour of Belgrade students and intelligentsia. During the winter of 1996/97, demonstrations forced Milosevic to reverse his annulment of the opposition's electoral victories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unity of the opposition was soon shattered, however, after its leaders began squabbling. A number of new student organizations then retreated to the universities where their leaders debated Serbia's predicament. But only weeks ago, after the government prepared a bill to limit university self-government, raise student fees and tighten admission requirements, the regime provided new impetus for student political mobilization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, protests at Belgrade University remained small, but the government has now formally adopted the restrictive legislation it promised, and that action may provide a new outlet for the considerable youth and urban dissatisfaction that exists in Yugoslavia. The 1996/97 demonstrations turned into a cathartic &quot;carnival&quot; and with a few exceptions the police and army remained loyal to the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Milosevic's front lines are now more extended, his foes (especially the Albanians and reformist Montenegrins) have become far more dangerous, and his allies rather less reliable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Milosevic is increasingly desperate, he still holds an ace in the hole. Namely, for the moment there seems to be no political figure who can take his place, and also effectively ensure Yugoslavia's relative political stability. Thus, the fractious opposition lacks a strong leader, and Djukanovic, for all of his popularity, remains a regional figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic also continues to prop up and carefully control radical nationalist figures to show the international community that should the current regime be pushed out, things might even get worse. While there is widespread aversion in the international community to doing business with Milosevic, such sentiment is overshadowed by the anxiety that any chaotic power shift in Belgrade might violently destabilize Southeastern Europe. The disruption of the enormous international investment in Bosnia's reconstruction is of particular concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, while Milosevic can't easily be counted out, a scenario similar to recent events in Indonesia is no longer far-fetched. The problems of the regime in Belgrade have significantly multiplied. Yugoslavia's economy continues its downward slide with its accompanying societal criminalization and violence (including the assassination of Milosevic cronies).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> group from within the existing oligarchy join forces with elements of the weakened but still lethal armed forces, Milosevic will find it difficult to politically survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Significant escalation of fighting in Kosovo, serious strife connected with obstreperous Montenegro or a resumption of student and civic unrest could become triggers for such a rapid and dramatic change in power. It has been credibly rumoured that in 1992, at the request of then Yugoslav president Dobrica Cosic, Milosevic had agreed to gracefully resign office, only to back out of the deal at the last moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stubborn, dedicated solely to the pursuit of power for its own sake and fearing possible international retribution for his wartime policies in Bosnia, Milosevic is highly unlikely to slip quietly into retirement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Yugoslav leader insists he's ahead in vote plagued by irregularities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EUROPEAN BUREAU</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PODGORICA, Yugoslavia - President Slobodan Milosevic and his opponents were locked in a bitter election race after Yugoslavs turned out in large numbers in chaotic voting yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yugoslavia's once struggling opposition claimed victory and urged Milosevic to peacefully quit power after 13 years of hardline rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milosevic, however, showed no signs of conceding defeat. His spokesperson, Nikola Sainovic, said early today he doubted there would even be a need for the Oct. 8 run-off vote - required if no candidate gets more than 50 per cent - because &quot;our candidate is leading.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As both supporters and opponents of the Yugoslav leader claimed they were ahead in the presidential vote, the state election commission closed up for the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With official results not expected until tomorrow, rival Serbian political parties were issuing their own results based on a partial count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Supporters of main opponent Vojislav Kostunica, a 56-year-old Belgrade lawyer backed by a coalition of 19 opposition factions, said he was leading with 57 per cent to 33 per cent for Milosevic based on returns from 45 per cent of 10, 000 polling stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;According to our count, the first-round victory is certain,&quot; Kostunica said early today. &quot;Dawn is coming to Serbia. I'm excited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no doubt that we overwhelmingly won on all levels,&quot; said opposition campaign manager Zoran Djindjic, who gave Kostunica 49.6 per cent of the vote to Milosevic's 36.8 per cent, with 310,909 votes counted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Milosevic's Socialist party claimed that Milosevic was leading Kostunica by 44 to 41 per cent with more than 940,000 votes counted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the ultra-nationalist Radical Party, once a member of Milosevic's coalition but now estranged, put Kostunica ahead with 53.53 per cent to Milosevic's 37.91 per cent with 1,937,734 votes counted at 4,358 polling stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party admitted its own candidate, one of three others in the race, was defeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Belgrade, thousands of opposition supporters declared victory in a central square near the site of a rock concert held to celebrate a win for Milosevic. Armed riot police kept the two sides apart, and there were reports of clashes between police and opposition demonstrators on a nearby bridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yugoslavs hoping for change after a decade of despair had turned out for yesterday's vote, which poll watchers said was marked by widespread irregularities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Serbia, 7.8 million people were eligible to vote for a federal president and parliament and for municipal politicians. Montenegro had 444,000 registered to vote, along with 100,000 Serbs from Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Center for Free Elections and Democracy, a private group that monitored voting, reported a turnout of 74.6 per cent in Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milosevic altered the Yugoslav constitution to give him the chance to extend his term another four years, with the possibility of running for a further term. Montenegro, the smaller partner in the Yugoslav federation, declared the changes invalid, and vowed to boycott the elections, which its liberal government rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Election monitors from the Democratic Opposition of Serbia coalition supporting Kostunica complained yesterday of lack of access at some polls, and condemned the voting rules. Observers in Belgrade complained they were kicked by police, and in Zitorade, central Serbia, there were reports soldiers were issued with ballots pre-marked for Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vote-rigging was predicted by many analysts, but most were holding their breath for the next developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's only an illusion that Milosevic will leave power,&quot; warned Miodrag Vukovic, an adviser to Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic. &quot;Those who think so forget who he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The coming days will indicate more clearly which way Milosevic will move, as results are announced by an electoral commission made up largely of his supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition members say much depends, too, on how many people will take to the streets if Kostunica is declared the loser in a fraudulent poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the enormous </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations of 1996 and 1997, those who hoped for a democratic transition were disillusioned by the fracturing of the opposition, which led to the Serbian strongman's triumph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milosevic, surviving through force and guile, took control of most of the Serbian media, and harassed and intimidated any who defied him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, attempts at revving up public anger failed as factional opposition leaders squabbled. The tide turned when Kostunica became coalition leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milosevic's opponents know they must turn out in great strength to prevent the notoriously brutal leader from crushing the new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> if he tries to hang on to power after a dubious win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some analysts predict Milosevic might allow Kostunica victory, but block him from making any important reforms through control over parliament.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE - For the second time in three months, Serbians are headed to the polls today to determine their nation's destiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Posters across Serbia proclaim, &quot;One more step to the finish line!&quot; in an effort to encourage voters to once and for all rid Yugoslavia of Slobodan Milosevic and his Socialist party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the dramatic October uprising forced Mr. Milosevic to accept defeat and concede his federal Yugoslav presidency to Vojislav Kostunica, Mr. Milosevic's socialists remained in control of the Serbian republic parliament. Today's election is seen as a crucial hurdle for Mr. Kostunica if his fledgling coalition government -- Democratic Opposition Party of Serbia (DOS) -- is to consolidate its power base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What remains of Yugoslavia at the federal level are the republics of Serbia and Montenegro. With economic ties between the two already partially severed and Montenegro's separatist president, Milo Djukanovic, threatening a referendum on independence, Mr. Kostunica's umbrella level of government could be ousted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With so much at stake, DOS is trying to once again capitalize on the tremendous wave of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serb sentiment that swept Mr. Kostunica to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party's election slogans encourage voters to &quot;clean out&quot; the rot of socialism. Since taking office 12 weeks ago, Mr. Kostunica and his coalition cabinet have embarked on a whirlwind campaign of domestic housecleaning and international bridge-building. But despite the tremendous efforts, Mr. Kostunica conceded this week that the situation he inherited was even worse than expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some cases, we knew what we were getting into, in other cases, they were either far more complex -- or complete surprises,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of particular concern is the worsening situation with Montenegro's possible secession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had been led to believe that Milosevic was the major obstacle to a successful union, but it appears that the problem goes much deeper,&quot; said Mr. Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even among Serbians, the prospect of breaking ties with Montenegro has become a growing popular sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to the domestic pressures has been the recent increase of violence, which has spilled out of Kosovo and into southern Serbia. With Albanian terrorists escalating their activities and seizing control of several Serb villages in the de-militarized zone, relations between Yugoslavia and NATO are once again being tested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, the Serbian military has respected the UN Technical Agreement and it has not yet deployed heavy weapons into the five-kilometre buffer zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Yugoslavia is stepping up its demands for the UN Security Council to take stronger action. Without a serious UN effort to curtail the Albanian occupation, Mr. Kostunica has made it clear that Serbian forces are prepared to &quot;cleanse the region of terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO spokesmen have repeatedly claimed they will not tolerate any Serbian military action in the demilitarized zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a potential showdown with NATO would jeopardize the flow of vital foreign aid that has been propping up the bankrupt Yugoslav treasury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the election campaign, Mr. Milosevic's Socialists and the right-wing Radical party have described this developing situation as &quot;NATO blackmail.&quot; Both Vojislav Seselj -- the Radical party leader, and Mr. Milosevic, have played to the voters' sense of patriotic pride -- urging Serbs to reject the &quot;blood money&quot; offered as foreign aid and thereby retain their independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such sentimental appeals have in the past kept Mr. Milosevic in power, even as Yugoslavia disintegrated. However, the polls here would indicate that Serbians are wearying of hard-core nationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course we recognize that with foreign investment, we will lose some control,&quot; said Vladimir Krajnovic, a 38-year-old Belgrade-based economist. &quot;However, if such a sacrifice means having a job and a future for my children, then I'm willing to give this up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After 10 years of oppressive sanctions, costly civil wars in Bosnia and Croatia and last year's devastating bombing campaign, many Yugoslavs are anxious for any sign of a possible economic recovery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Belgrade, there are some tell-tale signs of a renewal. A new pay phone system -- which has been in total disrepair for the past decade -- has been installed on downtown streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent banks are opening across Serbia and, with the &quot;inner wall&quot; of sanctions lifted, the free-falling dinar has been stabilized, although at one-third of its 1999 value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, by freezing the dinar and removing the Socialists' subsidies on many staple products, the new DOS policies have led to severe inflation in the marketplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As prices have soared, Mr. Milosevic has stepped up his attacks on the DOS party's platform. His election advertisements remind voters of the cost disparity and the Socialist party slogan reads: &quot;It's not too late to avoid disaster!&quot; But rather than stirring up nostalgic yearnings, most Belgraders find the ads amusing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is true that the official prices were lower, but there were never any such products in the stores,&quot; said Zoran Suvakovic, a senior editor with the Politika newspaper. &quot;It may cost us four times as much now, but at least we can actually purchase what we can no longer afford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost overnight, the black market economy that had unofficially kept Yugoslavia functioning and created criminal activity has been shut down. Under Mr. Kostunica's DOS regime, the police have been prosecuting many former Socialist officials. The most prominent arrest was that of Mihalj Kertes, the former chief customs administrator. His arrest has led to rampant speculation that Mr. Milosevic himself may soon face criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virtually all of the major public appointments have already been purged of Socialists and replaced by members of either DOS or its G-17 founders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Managing Yugoslavia's power company is a vital and challenging task, particularly as winter threatens to overload the battered power grid. Last year's NATO bombing only further reduced an already aged electrical production system. When coupled with summer's drought, which reduced the Danube hydroelectric capacity by 50 per cent, Serbia will fall well short of its minimum domestic requirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are already importing the maximum power and producing the maximum power,&quot; said Mr. Simovic. &quot;When the cold weather hits, there will definitely be regular blackouts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The temporary reprieve from power outages and inclement weather has served to prolong the euphoric mood of hope that Mr. Kostunica ignited with the Oct. 5 uprising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many Serbs, their new president has acquired an almost &quot;divine&quot; status, reflected in his approval ratings -- currently sitting at an almost impossible 91 per cent. His repeatedly strong stand against U.S. interests, particularly last month's unprecedented public snubbing of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, has elevated Mr. Kostunica to hero status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DOS has tried to capitalize on this popularity and convert it into votes for Zoran Djindic, the party's prime ministerial candidate in today's election. But Mr. Djindic's leadership is viewed by many Serbs as a potential liability to DOS. By having been long associated with the Serbian Democratic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Djindic is distrusted by most Serbs. The many compromises and coalition agreements he made with Mr. Milosevic have led voters to question his true values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't fully trust him, but he is the candidate for our party,&quot; said Vesna Jukic, a DOS political organizer. &quot;We will just have to hold our noses when we vote and tell ourselves that we're doing it for Kostunica.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it is considered highly unlikely that Mr. Milosevic could achieve a majority government, none of the polls has ruled the Socialists out of finishing second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September elections, when Mr. Milosevic was defeated, he was still able to get more than 1.8 million presidential votes, roughly 40 per cent of the electorate. These results, though, came through the control of the State Radio Television Service, as well as government newspapers. Since then, these outlets have switched their loyalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In protest, Mr. Milosevic filed a formal complaint against &quot;a prejudicial media&quot; with the Organization for Security and Co-operation of Europe, which is monitoring the election. It found that Mr. Milosevic had not been granted equal and objective coverage of his party's platform. However, under the complex Serbian electoral system, Mr. Milosevic stands to gain simply through the preponderance of candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On today's ballots there will be eight lists for voters to choose from various coalitions that comprise 209 different political parties and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even Zeljko Raznatovic -- &quot;Arkan,&quot; the infamous Tiger warlord -- has a political party entered on the ballots, despite the fact he was murdered last January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the splinter groups will fail to garner the minimum five per cent of the overall vote required to retain official status, and their share of the votes will be transferred proportionately to the major parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potential voter apathy due to political burnout could yet prove to be the spoiler in Mr. Kostunica's quest to consolidate control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For many Serbs, they want to believe that they already made their choice twice: First at the ballot box on Sept. 24 and then in the streets on Oct. 5,&quot; said Vesna Jukic. &quot;All DOS is asking for is for them to take that one more step.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the existing system, the 250 parliamentary seats are not selected to represent an individual riding, but are selected after each party's vote percentage determines its number of successful candidates. Although early results will be available within hours, it is not expected that a final election result will be confirmed until Monday. In the unlikely event that DOS fails to achieve the required 51 per cent majority, the possibility exists that yet another compromise government coalition will have to be formed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Western leaders will gather Friday in Sarajevo,<BR>a symbol of Balkan destruction and rebirth, to launch an effort<BR>to stabilize the region and make the Kosovo war Europe's last.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must help put the last pieces of the puzzle in place in southeast<BR>Europe,&quot; national security adviser Samuel Berger told a Washington<BR>audience Monday. &quot;We won the war, but it will be a hollow victory<BR>if we lose the peace.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the sweeping rhetoric and earlier talk of spending billions,<BR>no price tag for Balkan reconstruction will be announced, officials<BR>said.<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern is growing that reconstruction will be hampered by excluding<BR>the central piece of the puzzle: Serbia, which is still ruled<BR>by Slobodan Milosevic who presided over the bloody breakup of<BR>Yugoslavia.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Balkan leaders also worry that emergency aid for Kosovo, a province<BR>of Serbia that is now an international protectorate, will take<BR>precedence over the rest of the Balkans indefinitely.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very concerned with the sounds I hear,&quot; said Philip Dimitrov,<BR>Bulgaria's ambassador to the United States. &quot;We are trying to<BR>achieve a safe and prosperous neighborhood. You cannot expect<BR>good behavior in a slum.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International financial institutions are still assessing the regional<BR>impact of the 78-day air war for Kosovo. The war disrupted trade,<BR>transit, tourism and investment for six nations surrounding Yugoslavia,<BR>now made up only of Serbia and Montenegro. All six are former<BR>communist states struggling to build market economies.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albania, the poorest country in Europe, and Macedonia, the least<BR>developed former Yugoslav republic, were hardest hit. Bosnia,<BR>Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria also suffered.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the six countries face a cumulative gap between imports<BR>and exports of $ 1 billion, according to the World Bank, and 3%-4%<BR>reductions in economic growth.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some support for these countries has already been pledged, but<BR>a donor conference Wednesday in Brussels, Belgium, will focus<BR>only on Kosovo. Berger announced Monday that the United States<BR>was prepared to contribute up to $ 500 million to help the province<BR>rebuild.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the rest of Serbia, Berger said the United States would<BR>not provide &quot;a penny for reconstruction so long as a war criminal<BR>rules in Belgrade.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other U.S. officials say Friday's summit might announce programs<BR>to support dissident Serb groups and cities. The European Union<BR>has proposed restoring energy and water supplies to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">towns, but the United States is cool to the idea.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the war, Serbia was a major trading partner for Bosnia<BR>and Macedonia and the main transit route for other regional trade.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, is &quot;geographically a natural<BR>strategic point on the road, rail and power axis&quot; of southeastern<BR>Europe, said the Center for European Policy Studies, a Brussels<BR>think tank.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two road projects in the works before the war skirt Serbia. &quot;Corridor<BR>eight&quot; runs east-west from the Black Sea through Bulgaria and<BR>Macedonia to the Albanian port of Durres on the Adriatic. &quot;Corridor<BR>four&quot; is to connect Greece, Bulgaria and Romania.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But shipping routes along the Danube remain blocked by debris<BR>from Serb bridges, oil refineries and factories destroyed by NATO<BR>bombs.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Serbia is the key to the economic future of southeastern Europe,&quot;<BR>said Rory O'Sullivan, the World Bank's outgoing resident representative<BR>in Bosnia and newly appointed special representative for southeast<BR>Europe. &quot;No one will feel comfortable until Serbia comes back<BR>into the fold.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic, indicted for war crimes in Kosovo, is the only Balkan<BR>leader excluded from the Sarajevo summit. Friday's gathering is<BR>expected to attract 30 heads of state and will be the largest<BR>in Sarajevo.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole process means a lot to the people here,&quot; O'Sullivan<BR>said in a telephone interview from Sarajevo. &quot;It affects their<BR>psyches in an extraordinary way.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. and European officials say they are determined that the meeting<BR>will be more than window dressing.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our objective is to make it as concrete as possible,&quot; said<BR>Juergen Chrobog, the German ambassador to Washington.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany, the dominant power in the heart of Europe, proposed the<BR>so-called &quot;Stability Pact&quot; that Friday's summit will launch.<BR>A former German industrialist and chief of staff to Chancellor<BR>Gerhard Schroeder, Bodo Hombach, has been put in charge.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modeled after the U.S.-financed Marshall Plan, which brought prosperity<BR>to Western Europe after World War II, the pact is a largely European<BR>initiative meant to groom the Balkan nations for eventual membership<BR>in the European Union.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan said the initial emphasis will be on &quot;issues that can<BR>be fixed with political will and bring rapid benefits.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them: freer trade and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of people among the Balkan<BR>nations and shared electrical power.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donor conferences are scheduled in the fall. Reliance on such<BR>gatherings worries Balkan leaders. After meeting with Secretary<BR>of State Madeleine Albright last month in his rundown capital,<BR>Skopje, Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov told reporters that<BR>donor conferences are an &quot;inefficient&quot; means of raising cash.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democratization is just as important as money,&quot; German Foreign<BR>Minister Joschka Fischer said last month in Cologne, Germany,<BR>when the Stability Pact was signed by foreign ministers from 31<BR>nations. &quot;Without democratization, the money will just go into<BR>the wrong hands.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Balkan officials say economic growth is the best support young<BR>democracies can have. &quot;We are looking for investment, not handouts,&quot;<BR>Dimitrov said.<BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT is not an easy time for a Serbian filmmaker to be releasing a new movie in the United States, even for a veteran director like Goran Paskaljevic, who has long opposed Slobodan Milosevic's regime, who has expressed his shame over the atrocities committed by Serbian forces in Bosnia and Kosovo, who has been denounced as a traitor by the official press in Belgrade. For all that, he remains a Serb, and, as such, he is expected to throw light on the collective madness that has gripped a good many of his fellow Serbs of late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it happens, this was his objective when he began shooting &quot;Cabaret Balkan,&quot; his 11th feature film, in Belgrade in the early spring of 1998. It was still a year before NATO launched its aerial war against Yugoslavia in the name of saving Kosovo, but Mr. Paskaljevic was already convinced that President Milosevic was leading his nation to disaster. His movie is about people, not politics, but nonetheless about people driven to violence and despair by politics. The film's original title -- &quot;The Powder Keg&quot; -- said it all.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Many critics now say the film was prophetic, but it was normal to me that the powder keg would explode in the end,&quot; Mr. Paskaljevic said over coffee in the small apartment in Paris that he and his French wife, Christine, have just occupied. &quot;I believe it is an honest testimony of the dark and tragic atmosphere in Belgrade at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movie, which opens in New York on Friday, was renamed for the United States because Kevin Costner had registered the title &quot;The Powder Keg.&quot; But &quot;Cabaret Balkan&quot; also serves it well, hinting at the dark humor and macabre theatricality of the Serbian dance of death that Mr. Paskaljevic portrays. The film, which won the International Critics Prize for Best Film at the 1998 Venice Film Festival, has already been released in much of Western Europe and, more surprisingly, also in Belgrade and Sarajevo, where it drew enthusiastic crowds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The screenplay, written by Mr. Paskaljevic and Dejan Dukovski, is an adaptation of Mr. Dukovksi's play &quot;The Powder Keg,&quot; which was well received in Belgrade in the mid-1990's. But while the play presents a series of short stories set in Skopje, Macedonia, the movie takes place in Belgrade in the course of one night, linking the different tales in the style of &quot;La Ronde&quot; and setting them against the political background of a Serbia sliding into poverty, ostracized by the world and paralyzed by its own myths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sinister mood is set by the slurred opening words of the master of ceremonies at Cabaret Balkan, who addresses the camera as if speaking for Serbia to the world: &quot;Why do you laugh at me? Do you think I am funny? Do you think I am a freak? That I'm different from you? Is that why you have come? It doesn't matter. You're welcome.&quot; Welcome, he adds with a thin smile, because he has plans to upset you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stories that follow are indeed disturbing, each one ending in an act of violence, a violence that seems darkly logical in a context in which tension, frustration and distrust are feeding feelings of victimization and a desire for revenge. A taxi driver recognizes a policeman, now crippled by an accident, and sets out to repay a beating that the policeman once gave him. Two old friends, sparring in a boxing ring to keep fit, begin confessing how they have betrayed each other, until one of them explodes. A young man hijacks a bus and berates some passengers for their passivity. Another young man is mistaken for a gasoline thief and is chased by a lynch mob.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I try to show that the victim and the executioner nearly become the same,&quot; said Mr. Paskaljevic, whose last movie, the 1996 English-language &quot;Someone Else's America,&quot; was every bit as sentimental as &quot;Cabaret Balkan&quot; is menacing. &quot;That's our tragic problem. Most of the Serbian population feel like a victim, which is wrong. But it is a very strong feeling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A stockily built man of 52 with thinning long hair and, on this occasion, a three-day stubble, Mr. Paskaljevic likes to think of himself as an optimist, but he concedes that this is his most somber movie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot express hope in the film artificially,&quot; he said. &quot;Hollywood movies always express hope at the end of the story, but it is not like that in life. But I do find some hope in some of the characters, in their humanity, even in their tragic circumstances. Little gestures. For example, the political scene is the bus scene. The guy is nice to the old people; he lets them off the bus. He's nice to the young people, who are kissing each other and don't care. But he tries to shake up the middle classes and says, 'You need another war to wake up and become rebels.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, after another war has brought Serbia its fourth defeat in a decade, Mr. Paskaljevic is more upbeat. He is encouraged by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations that are beginning to take place in many Serbian towns, and he believes that the return of university students to classes in September may accelerate the demise of the regime. But he also hopes that the West will support the opposition more than it did during the 100-day protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that shook Serbia in the winter of 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't help because, for the American administration, Milosevic was the strongman of the Balkans who had signed Dayton,&quot; he said, referring to the agreement that ended the four-year conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. &quot;It's always easier to deal with dictators than democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reared in Marshall Tito's Yugoslavia and trained in the Prague film school known as FAMU, Mr. Paskaljevic has himself had ample experience of dictatorship. While he made his home in Belgrade, his films were frequently invited to the Berlin, Venice and Cannes film festivals, with his deadpan comedy &quot;Special Treatment&quot; winning a Golden Globe nomination for best foreign film in 1980. It also earned him a two-year ban on making films in Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The film was an allegory about a dictator, and I was asked by The Hollywood Reporter whom I meant,&quot; the director recalled with a laugh. &quot;I said, Stalin. And they asked, Tito? And I said, yes, Tito also. After that, I couldn't get work in Yugoslavia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1982, he made his first English-language film, &quot;Twilight Time,&quot; starring Karl Malden as an old man bringing up his two grandchildren. Four more films followed before he worked again in English in 1995 in &quot;Someone Else's America,&quot; starring Tom Conti and Miki Manojlovic (who is also in &quot;Cabaret Balkan&quot;). Reviewing this film in The New York Times, Stephen Holden said that the two actors infused the movie &quot;with enough soulfulness to lend a crude modern fairy tale about immigrants pursuing the American dream a heartwarming sweetness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Returning home from filming that movie in Brooklyn, however, Mr. Paskaljevic felt the need to address the crisis in Serbia. He obtained a small grant from the Ministry of Culture to make &quot;The Powder Keg.&quot; But his hopes of supposedly guaranteed financial help from Serbian state television evaporated once he presented the final screenplay. Still, with the film's $1.2 million budget eventually covered by co-producers in France, Greece, Turkey and Macedonia, he was able to present it at last year's Venice Film Festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr. Paskaljevic told an Italian newspaper that &quot;the totalitarian and intolerant regime of Milosevic&quot; was destroying Serbia, however, he was promptly accused of &quot;infantile treason&quot; by the pro-government Serbian newspaper, Politika, which also noted suggestively that other infamous intellectual traitors had been executed or had committed suicide. The Serbian authorities then refused to distribute the film, but the director found an independent theater in Belgrade that was willing to show it. And it caught on through word of mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Already 250,000 people have been to see the movie in Belgrade,&quot; he said. &quot;Young people treated it like a cult film. My idea was to shock people, to punch them. But many young people came out laughing and saying, 'Listen, the reality is much worse than your film.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Paskaljevic was particularly pleased by the movie's reception in Sarajevo, even though, at a post-screening press conference, a Bosnian journalist asked the director and his actors to state what each had done during the siege of Sarajevo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said, 'Listen, I will answer,' &quot; he recalled. ' &quot;First of all, you have no right to ask that because I am not on trial here. I came with good will, and I am very proud to be a Serb. But I have to tell you that I am ashamed of what we did in Sarajevo, and I came to apologize for that. I didn't do it, but somebody did it in my name.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Mr. Paskaljevic says he is no less ashamed of what Serbia has just done in Kosovo, but he also wants to look to the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very important that Serbia wake up and say we are also responsible for what is happening to us,&quot; he said. &quot;We must be aware of what is happening in Kosovo; we have to face the facts and look to the future. Our tragic mistake is that we are always looking to the past. We have to cut ourselves off from our myths of the past and see where we are today and what is going to be our place tomorrow. We can only do this through democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his next movie, though, Mr. Paskaljevic plans to leave the Balkans far behind.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Sept. 21, 1991</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first glance, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic appears to be the big victor of the Yugoslav crisis. By laying the foundations for a Greater Serbia, Eastern Europe's last hard-line Communist leader is riding higher than ever in the opinion of his fellow Serbs and has virtually crushed a once-formidable domestic opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On paper, everything seems to be going Milosevic's way. The Yugoslav army, the most powerful military force in the Balkans, is rapidly turning into a Serbian army. Forces loyal to the Serbian leader have grabbed large areas of neighboring Croatia and are poised to make similar territorial gains in Bosnia. As Yugoslavia disintegrates into its component parts, Milosevic has emerged as the strongest leader of the region's strongest state.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the long term, however, his political position does not look nearly as strong as it does now. The Greater Serbia that is being built on the ruins of Yugoslavia includes millions of non-Serbs: Croats, Albanians and possibly Slavic Muslims, if the war is extended to Bosnia. After everything that has happened over the past few months, it is unlikely these minorities will ever again accept rule from Belgrade, the federal and Serbian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Milosevic is not a man of vision. He is a day-to-day survivor,&quot; said Milos Vasic, an editor on the Belgrade weekly Vreme, one of the few Serbian media outlets not under the control of the Milosevic regime. &quot;The Greater Serbia that he is trying to create will be undefendable and unsustainable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At home, Milosevic has distracted the attention of most Serbs from their growing economic problems, including a 20 percent drop in industrial production since the beginning of the war. In the present atmosphere of jingoistic nationalism, many Serbs seem prepared to accept a decline in living standards for the sake of their country. But economic grievances are likely to resurface once the war is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The moment Milosevic stops his territorial campaign, he will face social unrest in Serbia. He knows that, which is one reason why it is impossible for him to stop,&quot; said Dragan Veselinov, a political scientist who heads the Serbian Peasants' Party, one of several small opposition parties. &quot;As long as he continues his war policy, he is able to neutralize the opposition by suggesting we are traitors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and other opposition leaders trace the war with Croatia to the anti-Communist demonstrations that swept Belgrade in early March. Milosevic used the army to disperse the demonstrators, a move that severely damaged his popular legitimacy and his reputation as a &quot;defender of the Serbs.&quot; For a few days, it seemed Milosevic might go the way of other Communist leaders in Eastern Europe. But by the end of March, the tense standoff between Serbs and Croats in border areas of Croatia had exploded into fighting. Serbia blamed the Croats for the border incidents, but opposition politicians and independent journalists here say they are convinced they were exploited by Milosevic to repair his domestic image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former banker and Communist apparatchik, Milosevic, 49, has used nationalism as a political weapon since coming to power in Serbia in 1987. He established himself as Serbian leader by absorbing the republic's two autonomous regions: the predominantly ethnic-Albanian Kosovo province in the south and Vojvodina in the north, home to many ethnic Hungarians. These first moves toward creating a Greater Serbia were enormously popular among Serbs, who felt their nation had not received adequate recognition in post-World War II Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second stage of Milosevic's campaign to unite Serbs into a single state has also proved highly popular here. The rights of the Serbian minority living in Croatia have long been a sensitive subject for a nation with a vivid collective memory of atrocities committed by the puppet Nazi state of Croatia during World War II. Older Belgrade residents can recall hundreds of bodies of Serbs floating down the Sava River from the direction of Croatia. When a nationalist regime came to power in Zagreb last year, many Serbs feared history would repeat itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mistrust of Croatia is so deeply etched into the Serbian national psyche that even Milosevic's most ardent political opponents have had to take it into account. It has now become a political commonplace in Belgrade that the post-World War II borders between Serbia and Croatia are unjust and must be corrected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Croatia lost the war, but it won the peace. It even gained territories. Croatia did not pay any penalty for what it did to Serbia. This must be put right,&quot; said Vuk Draskovic, leader of the opposition Serbian Renewal Party, which brought tens of thousands of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrators out into the streets of Belgrade in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anti-Croat fervor has been whipped up by the Serbian media, which, except for Vreme and the former Communist Party daily Borba, are firmly under Milosevic's control. Serbian newspapers routinely refer to the Croatian national guard as &quot;Ustashi,&quot; the pejorative term used to describe Croatian Nazis in World War II. News bulletins routinely lead with reports of Croatian attacks on Serbian or federal troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Belgrade is little more than 100 miles from the fiercest fighting in eastern Croatia, there are few outward signs of war here. Sidewalk cafes are crowded. Stores and movie theaters are full. On the surface, the Serbian capital seems a prosperous and relaxed city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private conversations, however, are dominated by the war. The mobilization of thousands of young men to join the army this week has clearly touched a sensitive national chord, even though it is not a subject of public discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been reports of scattered mutinies in military barracks around Serbia and widespread draft evasion. An officer responsible for mobilizing reservists said that, on a typical night, he had been able to deliver only 15 out of 120 summonses to report for military duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time is running out for the Yugoslav army,&quot; said Vreme editor Vasic. &quot;The response to mobilization has been getting poorer and poorer. They lack conscripts. Nobody wants to go to this war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of now, Serbia and its ally Montenegro are the only republics where the federal army is still respected as an institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the moment, the army and the Serbian territorial forces clearly have the upper hand in the war. As long as Serbia continues to accumulate territory, Milosevic's position seems secure. But Serbian opposition leaders insist that the political tide will turn as soon as there is any reversal on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's impossible to defeat Milosevic in Serbia. All our internal problems have been dissolved in the war,&quot; said Zoran Djingic, leader of the Democratic Party. &quot;Milosevic, like Napoleon, will be defeated on the battlefield. The army in Croatia will come back to Serbia and they will overthrow Milosevic. I don't think he can succeed in the long term. The only question is how long it will take to defeat him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE pavement cafes are full of well-dressed people enjoying the last of the summer sun amid the bustle of what could easily be a western European capital city. It is hard to imagine that a few months ago Belgrade was the bombing target of a massive air force and is predicted to be the focus of a fierce political struggle in the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already there is a slight chill in the air, auguring the arrival of the bitter Balkan winter, and beneath the facade of normality the potential for hardship is great. Yesterday, the director of the state-owned electricity company warned that bomb damage to the electricity supply system means some major Serbian cities will be without central heating this winter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The toll of ten years of conflict and international sanctions is also evident. A newspaper report revealed that Serbs are the lowest paid in the former Yugoslavia. The average Slovenian worker earns 13 times more than his Serbian counterpart, who gets around GBP 30 per month. Much of this hardship has been spared Belgrade by a government which fears the wrath of a city which is home to one-eighth of the Serbian population.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bratislav Grubacic, the editor of Belgrade's English-language news service, said protest fatigue and relative prosperity has meant that the torch of opposition has passed from the capital to the provinces. &quot;In Belgrade you don't see much on the surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The authorities deliberately try to ensure normality because they are afraid of Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, people here are tired of ten years of war and demonstrations so it is harder to feel the tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Something happened recently in Serbian politics. The Serbian provinces became much more clear in their opposition to the government than Belgrade itself. Basically, they suffered much more during the Kosovo war. They became much poorer than Belgrade, where you can still find second jobs. More people were mobilised and more of their sons were killed. There was very little mobilisation in Belgrade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government of Slobodan Milosevic was obviously as concerned about body bags as Bill Clinton, and sought to spread the human cost of the Kosovo conflict outside of the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But still the opposition, galvanised by the war and Serbia's economic problems, has forced the government to offer early elections as a means of dividing its opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, members of the ruling coalition said they would be prepared to hold elections two years early if the opposition groups wanted them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday a spokeswoman for Milosevic's party, the Socialist Party of Serbia (SDS), said elections could be held on 7 November. Although there are regular elections in Yugoslavia, it is difficult to describe them as democratic. The media is mostly state-controlled; only Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (SPO), and President Milosevic have access to television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, there is a strong identification between the ruling party and the state, which mirrors the former communist system where the state and party were indistinguishable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is difficult to see how the elections can be normal and democratic. It is just a way of defusing tension and saying to the people, 'Why go to demonstrate when you can vote' and 'Elections or civil war?'&quot; said Mr Grubacic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic, the leader of the largest opposition party, which also runs Belgrade city council, has abandoned the tactics of street demonstrations which made him famous in 1996 and added his voice to government calls for elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This has raised doubts about the once fiery rabble-rouser's commitment to the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Grubacic said: &quot;Draskovic is selling out his brave opposition adventures since 1991. He has grown older and has lost interest in street risings against the authorities. Now he is more interested in business and a good life. He was always regarded as someone emotional, charismatic and unpredictable - now he is predictable. Whenever there is a need to mess up the opposition, Draskovic will do it to help Milosevic. Maybe they are not directly connected but I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Mr Draskovic is unwilling to oppose Mr Milosevic, then the Alliance for Change, a coalition headed by Zoran Djindjic, does not have the power. Last week, an opinion poll showed the alliance was rising in popularity and would poll almost 15 per cent of the vote. This put it behind the SPO with 18.1 per cent and above the SDS, which would gain 13.7</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> per cent. But Mr Milosevic's ruling coalition - which includes the extreme nationalist Serbian Radical Party and the Yugoslav Left party led by his wife - would gain 24 per cent of the vote, leaving it the single biggest grouping while the opposition remains split.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Alliance for Change cannot mount an effective challenge to the government by itself and we do not know if Draskovic wants to do it. All the alliance can do is catch the wave of dissatisfaction and ride it. They have no access to the media so they cannot bring people on the streets,&quot; says Mr Grubacic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People distrust and have been disappointed by the opposition. The rule of the SPO in Belgrade has been tinged with corruption and Djindjic is seen as ineffective. The demonstration last week was not led by the opposition, it was simply people going out on the streets because they are fed up with Milosevic, not because they endorse the opposition leaders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The best example of disillusionment with the established opposition is a protest in the southern Serbian town of Leskovac, where an unknown television station technician appealed for a demonstration after the withdrawal of the Yugoslav army from Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 20,000 people, a third of the town's population, went on the streets. After recognised opposition politicians arrived, the number of protesters on the streets fell to 2,000. Commentators believe there is little prospect of a new leader arising from any of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> groups. Milo Djukanovic, the president of Montenegro, has shown no desire to play a role in Serbia and General Momcilo Perisic, a former chief of staff of the Yugoslav army, is seen as a useful asset for the opposition but not a potential leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the inability of the Serbian opposition parties to express the people's discontent, many Serbs, even some inside the SDS, believe Mr Milosevic must resign. SDS members realise they can no longer govern with Mr Milosevic at their head. But he still retains a strong hold on the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Grubacic said: &quot;I do not know when Milosevic will fall from power - as soon as possible, I hope. What I do know is that his model for governing has expired. Now he does not have a single idea about what to do apart from disrupt the opposition and buy some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You never know when problems will happen that could put pressure on the government. It could be sparked by some stupid thing or some arrogant action by the authorities. Then who knows what will pull the trigger. He will scare people with the threat of civil war and people are afraid of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It will take some time until people are desperate enough to accept that price. This is the criteria under which Milosevic will fall.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a military operation, it was insignificant. But as a symbol, there is no more potent metaphor for Russia's regard of the West than the image last weekend of 200 Russian soldiers seizing a Kosovo airfield, and then lining up armored personnel carriers to keep NATO troops out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kremlin officials offered a strategic explanation for the move, involving the need to acquire bargaining chips in talks on Kosovo's future and to establish Moscow once and for all as a player in the peace process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But most Russians were uninterested in the diplomacy. For them, it was a moment to savor, a rare act of one-upmanship by a faded power against a military that once viewed them with fear and awe. But it was a chance to say vicariously what they increasingly feel: that they are fed up with the overbearing West in general, and the United States in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not easy for most Westerners to understand. But 78 days of war in Yugoslavia, a country a thousand miles removed from Moscow and no special soulmate of Russia in any case, seems to have convinced many Russians that the West is their enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the anti-Western attitudes that were accumulating in the society resulted in this explosion when the war began,&quot; Igor Bunin, a historian and director of Moscow's Center for Political Technology, said in an interview. In focus groups involving scores of Moscow residents, he said, &quot;many respondents said at the time that the bombs were not falling on Yugoslavia, but on their own heads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feeling is not universal. Some polls show Russian opinion of the United States and the West has softened somewhat since the war's peak.  But even Russian newspapers, which viewed last weekend's operation in Kosovo as a diplomatic and public-relations debacle, called it &quot;dashing&quot; and lightning-fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One noted with satisfaction that Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's airplane had been forced to perform a midair U-turn and to return to Moscow when news of the troop </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> surfaced -- just deserts, because former Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov had been forced to abandon a Washington trip in midair when the bombing began in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Russia's pleasure at such slight victories seems out of place, one need only listen to politicians and military leaders to realize the depths of their anger at the West's supposed efforts to feed on Russian weakness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In anonymous remarks this weekend, Russian military officials repeatedly talked of ending their humiliation by American and NATO forces, which bombed Yugoslavia with impunity. Ordinary Muscovites frequently express the conviction that NATO and the West have Russia in their gunsights, and that the Yugoslavia war was merely a test run for a larger conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of their reasoning is no secret. In the former Soviet Union, average people suffered, but could still take pride in military and scientific achievements. Democratic Russia promised affluence, peace and full membership in the club of Western nations, which many Russians had admired for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But none of it has come about. Russia's foundering transition to capitalism was plotted largely by American academics and business leaders and carried out by pro-Western politicians; some now see it as a Western plot to impoverish the nation. Except for honorary memberships in organizations like the Group of Seven leading industrial nations and NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace, Moscow has largely been shut out of Western decision making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO itself has proven far more of a sticking point than many Westerners realized. The West rebuffed Russia's early proposals to move toward full membership in the alliance. When the United States and Europe first announced plans to admit new members to NATO from Central Europe, Russian leaders immediately complained that they were being encircled by a potentially hostile military force -- fears that NATO tried to allay by giving Russia an advisory seat in the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The decision to enlarge NATO could not be understood by anybody in Russia because Russians know very well how weak Russia is today,&quot; said Sergei Rogov, who heads the Government's Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada. &quot;On the other hand, Russians felt that we ended the cold war and started to behave nicely by dissolving the Warsaw Pact, withdrawing troops, cutting arms. And thus the very maintenance of NATO was seen as strange.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rogov argued that the West consistently underestimated the Russian public's suspicion of NATO's expansion. That raised the prospect an anti-Western explosion should NATO became involved in a European crisis, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. Bunin, of the Moscow center, said Yugoslavia provided the spark. The problem, he said, was not that Russians saw Yugoslavia or its President, Slobodan Milosevic, as allies or martyrs; the problem was rather that the Russians had no opinions about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> propaganda in Russia,&quot; he said. &quot;Nobody looked at Milosevic as a new Hitler or as the person who is seen in the West. And so the NATO and U.S. attack looked to us as completely unprovoked, as the step toward world hegemony.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing seems singularly ironic - or utterly appropriate, depending on your point of view. Barely a fortnight after the terrorist atrocities in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, an American breezes through town hawking a book and a television series that celebrate and promote what sounds like an oxymoron: non-violent conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Jack DuVall is painting on a canvas far broader than a fortnight. The executive producer of the two-part documentary and the co-author of the weighty book called A Force More Powerful remarks that this is the last place on Earth to be offered the chance to see what he's devoted much of the past five years of his life to.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-part film, which screens on Sky's Sundance Channel this month (the companion book, sparsely available in hardback now, will be published in paperback in December), was screened on American public television almost a year ago and is a survey of the 20th century's great non-violent struggles for freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project was undertaken at the millennium's end, he says, to ensure that we would remember our recent history not just as a series of bloody insurrections and armed conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were concerned that at the end of the century there would be all these media records of the wars and revolutions and there would not also be a look back at other kinds of conflicts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His choice of words is careful. DuVall, who is fond of the term &quot;non-violent weapons&quot;, is anything other than a peacenik and he resists the yoking together of the terms &quot;conflict&quot; and &quot;resolution&quot; because he's keen to distinguish non-violence from inaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not necessarily talking about resolution,&quot; he says, &quot;but we're saying that when conflict cannot be resolved it needs to be carried on in a non-violent fashion. So we begin to shift the phenomenon of conflict away from the uninformed choice of violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are sobering words for a world staring down the barrel of a US-led response to the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. But human history is littered with evidence of the failure of violent conflict. When force prevails it gives the illusion of victory, DuVall suggests, but it fails because the very idea that force prevails is an oxymoron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both book and film derived from the academic work of Peter Ackerman, whose book Strategic Non-Violent Conflict: The Dynamics of People Power in the Twentieth Century grew out of scholarly research that began in the 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They amount to a comprehensive survey of the great non-violent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the century. Among events he documents with detail and precision, but in an easily digestible style, are Mahatma Gandhi's campaign for self-rule in India, which began with his historic and symbolic defiance of the hated salt laws; the Danes' resistance to occupying Nazi forces, which resulted in the escape to Sweden of almost all Danish Jews; the black occupation of segregated diners in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1960; the 1980 shipyard strikes in Gdansk, Poland, which history would come to see as the first crack in the pedestal of totalitarian communist rule in Europe; and the spectacularly successful 1985 boycotts by black shoppers of white-owned stores in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at all points, the writers are keen to underline the idea of non-violent struggle as a form of conflict. The Rev James Lawson, a student of Gandhi's methods who inspired three Nashville sit-ins, is quoted as urging that non-violent resistance needs to be organised and orchestrated with military precision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It needs fierce discipline,&quot; he says, &quot;training and strategies; it does not happen spontaneously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DuVall, who worked in US Air Force counter-intelligence during the Vietnam War and later was a speechwriter for presidential contenders, including Gary Hart and Walter Mondale, is at pains to emphasise the practicality of non-violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its great proponents, he says, &quot;came to that choice because they had - or thought they had - no other choice available. It doesn't have to be a principled decision - though that is not to say that no valid principle can attach to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the shadow of the atrocities of September 11 and to a West aching for revenge, the idea of non-violence may ring a little hollow. &quot;Try telling that to Osama bin Laden,&quot; some may say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But DuVall says that, in geopolitical terms, the major powers have taken too little note of the effectiveness of non-violent struggle in eroding the power base of terrorist regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gandhi didn't bomb the Houses of Parliament,&quot; DuVall says. &quot;He went after the Raj's basis of support in his homeland. The same lesson may be drawn from what happened in [the former] Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the book we quote at some length a number from the democratic Opposition in Serbia who say, 'If you had just given us the help that we were asking for in 1993 and 1994 we might have prevented what happened in Bosnia'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Americans believe that Nato bombing 'softened up' Milosevic. But I don't think you'd find a Serbian who agrees with that. If anything, it hardened his grip on power. When, finally, in 2000, US agencies channelled help to non-violent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> forces inside Serbia, they brought him down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many whose analysis runs counter to the prevailing ideology, DuVall seems a little like a voice in the wilderness. The networks in the US shunned his show, though it aired on PBS, which can be received on every set in the country. Here, TVNZ turned the documentary down and it will screen on a channel that only Sky digital subscribers see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sees the decisions, though, less as a rejection than as &quot;a kneejerk assumption that they knew what this was about, that their model for non-violence was the saintly Gandhi giving an inspiring speech and everyone saying, 'I will lay my body down to get run over.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not someone sitting around pleading for morally correct behaviour. We are showing real conflicts in which people are fighting and contending and getting hurt and sometimes losing their lives because they had a passionate cause, but had found it possible to engage in conflict in another way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes the media generally &quot;actively neglect&quot; non-violent struggle (until the baton-waving police move in and it gets violent) because it does not always or necessarily generate dramatic and striking images.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for all that - and despite the events in America - he feels optimistic. &quot;This latest wholesale act of terrorism - although this may not be apparent right at the moment - will necessarily anathematise the use of violence,&quot; he says. &quot;Other strategies will have to be reconsidered and taken up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A Force More Powerful screens on the Sundance Channel on October 21 and 28. The book (hardback $81.95, paperback $54.95) is published by St Martin's Press, whose New Zealand representative is Pan Macmillan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON, Oct. 7</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the mid-1990's, when the United States was trying to end the war in Bosnia and then enforce the peace, Washington's contacts with Slobodan Milosevic were frequent, volatile and very much in person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, after a shouting match over policy with American diplomats in his palace in Belgrade, Mr. Milosevic would signal a servant to open the doors to a large dining room, where a meal of several courses awaited and where the conversation could be, according to participants, jocular and cordial.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations with Mr. Milosevic at that period were never warm, but were at the height of a roller-coaster ride that coursed over a decade from a lack of attention during a Bush presidency distracted first by the fall of Communism elsewhere, and then by fighting Saddam Hussein, to outright war last year under President Clinton. Now, finally, Washington is celebrating the downfall of a man who for years delighted in defying, befuddling and belittling his far more powerful foes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Clinton administration tries to temper its pleasure, senior officials are looking back at an opponent -- the last of the major East European strongmen -- who has caused as many internal debates and as much anguish in Washington as any other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the skirmishes were between the secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, who with her Czechoslovak origins and childhood memories of Belgrade holds a special kinship to the Balkans and Eastern Europe, and the ambassador to the United Nations, Richard C. Holbrooke, a forceful diplomat who did the unpalatable deal with Mr. Milosevic to end the war in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the beginning, these kinds of diplomatic differences marked Washington's relations with Yugoslavia. In 1990 and 1991, the ambassador to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmerman, felt that the Bush administration, distracted by the Persian Gulf war, made too little effort, too late, to stop the brewing conflict in Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary of State James A. Baker said in 1991 that the United States did &quot;not have a dog in that fight,&quot; that Washington's national interest was not centered on the Balkans and that it was unwise to commit American troops there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, while running for the presidency, Mr. Clinton seemed to suggest that he would do more to confront Mr. Milosevic and the Bosnian Serbs, who were besieging Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and conducting the worst killing in Europe since World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once in power, the Clinton administration wanted little to do with the conflict, which it regarded as Europe's business and which it believed could be contained by United Nations sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia in 1992. In Congressional testimony, Secretary of State Warren Christopher called the killing in Bosnia &quot;a problem from hell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a tentative foray into the Balkans in 1993, Mr. Christopher, who never seemed persuaded by what he was trying to sell, went to Europe to persuade the allies to agree to a &quot;lift and strike&quot; policy. This called for the lifting of an arms embargo that had been placed on all of former Yugoslavia -- thus giving the well-armed Serbs an automatic advantage over the outgunned Bosnian Muslims -- and the launching of strategic NATO airstrikes at Bosnian Serb targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British and French, who had troops in Bosnia as part of a United Nations force, objected strongly to airstrikes, and the Clinton White House backed off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 1995, with the killing in Bosnia under way for three years and unpunished, the Clinton administration looked for a way to end the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The engagement with Mr. Milosevic turned from sporadic contact to full-fledged diplomatic involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, though, the administration had to make a critical decision. Should it deal with Mr. Milosevic, the mastermind of the war, or with his surrogates, the Bosnian Serbs, led by Radovan Karadzic?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To decide that question, a diplomat with an uncanny skill for dealing with ugly regimes, Robert Frasure, was dispatched to Belgrade, where he held lengthy talks and had many meals with Mr. Milosevic. Mr. Frasure, who had negotiated with the Marxist dictator of Ethiopia, Mengistu Haile Mariam, who eventually fled his country, and then with the ruling white regime in South Africa, which ultimately collapsed, recommended dealing directly with the boss of the Balkans, Mr. Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Frasure was one of four Americans killed when their armored personnel carrier drove over a mountainside in Bosnia as Mr. Holbrooke, Gen. Wesley K. Clark and other officials took a perilous road into Sarajevo because Bosnian Serb guns made it too dangerous to fly. Mr. Holbrooke then began a dizzying flurry of talks, meeting Mr. Milosevic as NATO launched its first sustained airstrikes against Bosnian Serb targets in September 1995. The negotiations culminated in the Dayton accords, reached at an Ohio air base that November and signed in Paris in December 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics charged that the administration became too close to Mr. Milosevic, treating him as part of the solution to the war, rather than part of the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, there were arguments within the administration about whether sanctions against Mr. Milosevic should be eased. As ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Albright was strongly opposed, as was Vice President Al Gore's top foreign policy adviser, Leon Fuerth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this period all kinds of American officials visited Mr. Milosevic, including senators and House members, who would be shown on Serbian television -- lending, for Mr. Milosevic's purposes, authenticity to his reign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Dayton deal, which resulted in the dispatch of more than 30,000 peacekeeping troops to Bosnia, Mr. Holbrooke, and then the assistant secretary for European affairs, John Kornblum, continued to visit Belgrade. Their purpose was to persuade Mr. Milosevic to get his acolytes in the Serbian part of Bosnia to live up to their commitments at Dayton, including allowing Muslims hounded out of their homes to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On one occasion, however, Mr. Milosevic delivered. In mid-1996, at Mr. Holbrooke's request, he engineered Dr. Karadzic's removal from office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By early 1998 Mr. Milosevic, as many feared, began to stir again, this time in the Serbian province of Kosovo, where a large Albanian majority began an armed rebellion against years of repression by the Yugoslav Army and Serbian police. Again, as in Bosnia, Mr. Milosevic's forces committed massacres and drove out thousands of Albanian families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1998, Mr. Holbrooke returned to Belgrade to reason with the strongman. The upshot, after more than 10 days of argument and the threat of NATO bombing, was an agreement that allowed outside, unarmed monitors into Kosovo to observe a truce between the Serbian forces and the growing Kosovo Liberation Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A massacre by Serbs in the Albanian village of Racak in January 1999 decisively broke the truce. By then Dr. Albright had decided that only force could bring Mr. Milosevic, now in charge of a diminished and isolated Serbia, under control. She argued strenuously at the White House for building a NATO consensus that if Mr. Milosevic did not agree to a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo he would be punished with airstrikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She had also concluded that Yugoslavia, where she had walked the streets as a child when her father was the Czechoslovak ambassador to Belgrade, could not be a normal country with Mr. Milosevic at the helm. (Her only encounter with Mr. Milosevic -- in May 1997 in Belgrade as part of a tour of the Balkans as Secretary of State -- was, according to aides, confrontational and blunt.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the war in Kosovo over, Mr. Milosevic remained in power, though indicted for war crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Albright made no secret of her desire to see him go. She argued that the Serbs, and Europe, needed and deserved better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr. Milosevic announced in July that he was holding direct elections for the presidency on Sept. 24, Washington had already prepared some ground by financing civic groups and independent media opposed to his regime. This support was rapidly fortified and an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operation, intended to keep in contact with the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was established under the American ambassador, William Montgomery, in Budapest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the administration had to be careful. The opposition presidential candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, was fiercely independent and critical of American policy in Kosovo and Bosnia. In the end, the sweeping </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election result and the strength of the sentiment on the streets of Belgrade late this week were the work of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Holbrooke, Mr. Milosevic was &quot;the arsonist of south-central Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As long as he was in power, you couldn't deal with the problems there,&quot; he said. &quot;Now he has gone, the real problems will emerge but at least you can deal with them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Holbrooke, who has dealt with Mr. Milosevic more than any other American official, cautioned that Mr. Milosevic's quick decision to stay on in political life would be &quot;vastly complicating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Dr. Albright, the show of people power was a moment of vindication. She learned of Mr. Milosevic's collapse as she flew toward Washington after a disheartening round of Middle East talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was asked how his departure ranked among her moments in office. &quot;This is something very personal to me,&quot; she said, standing in the aisle of the secretary of state's plane. &quot;I have always felt very strongly that the Serbian people were terrific. They had gotten a lousy deal by being ruled by Milosevic.&quot;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Several hundred retired government workers,<BR>carrying placards equating President Slobodan Milosevic with Nazi<BR>leader Adolf Hitler, called for the Yugoslav leader's ouster Thursday<BR>in a march past government buildings still scarred from NATO airstrikes.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wake up, Serbia! Slobo out!&quot; shouted the retired workers, who<BR>were once among Milosevic's strongest supporters. Others stuffed<BR>a mock ballot box with slips of paper to show their desire to<BR>vote against Milosevic, whose term expires in 2001.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, several dozen university students and army reservists<BR>who fought in Kosovo plastered stickers and signs reading &quot;Milosevic:<BR>Get out!&quot; along the city's main pedestrian street. Police immediately<BR>ripped down the stickers and chased off the demonstrators.<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests, rare in the Yugoslav capital in recent years, came<BR>only days after the first large public protest against Milosevic<BR>and his Communist regime since the end of 11 weeks of NATO airstrikes<BR>on Yugoslavia. Tuesday, nearly 10,000 people, waving Serbian flags<BR>and chanting &quot;Resignation,&quot; gathered in the southern city of<BR>Cacak to demand Milosevic's ouster.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 20 other protests are planned for this summer, opposition<BR>leaders said Thursday. Among them: Tuesday in the Yugoslav city<BR>of Uzice, southwest of Belgrade; July 8 in Prokuplje, southeast<BR>of Belgrade; and July 16 in Kraljevo, south of Belgrade.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have two aims: Milosevic's resignation and early, free and<BR>fair elections,&quot; says Vladen Batic, head of an umbrella opposition<BR>group called Alliance for Change. &quot;We want this regime to go<BR>in a peaceful, democratic way. We'll go from town to town, from<BR>house to house, from man to man and light the torch of democracy<BR>in Serbia.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Yugoslavs say Milosevic's political problems help the effort<BR>to oust him. The Yugoslav leader, they note, has:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Allowed NATO peacekeepers to assume control of the sacred<BR>Serbian province of Kosovo.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Been indicted as an international war criminal.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Been denounced by the Serbian Orthodox Church for the country's<BR>lack of democracy.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Sparked the political and economic isolation of Yugoslavia.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Presided over an increasingly deteriorating economy.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is our moment. Now is the time for change,&quot; says Cedomir<BR>Radoskovic, executive director of the Civic Alliance for Serbia,<BR>an opposition group.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But few here expect the badly divided opposition to capitalize<BR>on growing public discontent. &quot;We're racked with problems,&quot;<BR>says Miroslav Filipovic, vice president of Civic Alliance. &quot;It<BR>all comes down to pride and ego. Yes, ego. Everyone wants to lead,<BR>and no one wants to follow.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Divisions are so great that many opposition groups refuse to talk<BR>to one another; their leaders won't appear in the same room. Others<BR>openly criticize one another in the media and discourage attendance<BR>at rival groups' rallies.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last three attempts to oust Milosevic -- in 1991, 1993 and<BR>1996 -- failed because of such lack of unity. These deep divisions<BR>once again offer Milosevic his best hope for political survival,<BR>at least in the near term, analysts say.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Milosevic couldn't ask for a better opposition to suit his purposes,&quot;<BR>says Branislav Vujinovic, head of the Belgrade Chamber of Commerce.<BR>&quot;Nothing will be accomplished and nothing will be changed if<BR>these people don't stop fighting. Every one of them appears to<BR>put his own agenda ahead of the good of the nation.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal Party, for example,<BR>is the only opposition leader with a sizable following. Polls<BR>shows that 15% of Yugoslavia's 11 million people would vote for<BR>him as the next president, second only to Milosevic, with 21%.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tall, bearded writer, widely criticized for his healthy ego,<BR>denounces the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests held earlier this week.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not the time for change,&quot; Draskovic, 52, said in an<BR>interview. &quot;When the time has come, I will announce it. There<BR>is no point participating in these pointless street rallies. I<BR>am not ready.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic says he has every reason to refuse to cooperate with<BR>his &quot;selfish, egocentric&quot; opposition colleagues.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996 and 1997, Draskovic led three months of protests that<BR>came close to toppling the Milosevic regime. He then decided to<BR>run for president of Serbia, one of the two republics that make<BR>up Yugoslavia. But Zoran Djindjic, leader of the opposition Democratic<BR>Party, encouraged residents to boycott the election, and Draskovic<BR>placed third in the balloting.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeking revenge, Draskovic joined with Milosevic's Socialist Party<BR>of Serbia to oust Djindjic as mayor of Belgrade.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other opposition groups have banded together under the Alliance<BR>for Change and say they will pursue Milosevic's ouster regardless<BR>of Draskovic.<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, June 25</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For opposition politicians in Yugoslavia, this should be showtime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slobodan Milosevic has lost his fourth war in a row and surrendered the sacred Serbian homeland of Kosovo to heavily-armed foreigners. He has been indicted as a war criminal, the Swiss say they are swooping down on his supposed bank accounts and the United States has offered $5 million to anyone who helps to nab him. A third of Yugoslavia is out of work, incomes are down 40 percent this year and, according to a credible poll by a private firm this week, 70 percent of Serbs blame Mr. Milosevic for the whole sorry mess.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, as has been the case for nearly a decade, the opposition seems incapable of seizing the day. United in their eagerness to dump a dictator and end Serbia's isolation as an international pariah, opposition leaders remain hobbled by their competing egos. &quot;Mr. Milosevic could not choose a better opposition because, if it repeats its unforgivable mistakes, he will be in power forever,&quot; grumbled Slobodan Vuksanovic, vice president of the Democratic Party, one of a cluster of pro-Western parties here. &quot;We have an ego problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exhibit A in the disunity of the Serbian opposition and the primacy of ego is Vuk Draskovic, the only figure with a sizable national following, his own television station and the populist razzle-dazzle to lure a large number of Serbs into the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic's haughty disdain for a fractured opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that desperately needs his charisma, his television station and his political machine helps explain why democracy in Serbia has been so much more elusive than in the rest of post-Communist Eastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tall, bearded and prone to self-dramatizing soliloquy, Mr. Draskovic, 52, a former best-selling author of blood-soaked nationalist novels, is not humble about his political gifts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am the king of the streets,&quot; Mr. Draskovic said in an interview today at the headquarters of his Serbian Renewal Party. &quot;I know better than anyone in the world what could be the real moment for demonstrations to bring down Mr. Milosevic. This is not the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders of nearly every other opposition party in Yugoslavia disagree on the question of timing. They have joined to form the Alliance for Change and announced that on Tuesday they will begin a series of mass protests around Serbia to demand Mr. Milosevic's resignation and free elections under the supervision of European monitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must harness the anger of the Serbian people,&quot; said Vladan Batic, coordinator of the alliance. &quot;After Kosovo, everything is different. People finally understand that political changes are necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic, who also senses that the loss of Kosovo will prove to be a mortal blow to Mr. Milosevic's rule, said he wishes the alliance luck but does not feel like associating with &quot;small political parties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not ready to waste time in closed rooms discussing stupid things,&quot; Mr. Draskovic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As much as other opposition leaders may resent Mr. Draskovic's uppity tone, they tend to agree that without him and his party, which has a proven record of being able to turn out tens of thousands of protesters against Mr. Milosevic for weeks on end, it will be difficult to sustain pressure on the Yugoslav President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vuk won't call us and we don't want to call him, and Mr. Milosevic is rubbing his hands together in delight,&quot; conceded Mr. Vuksanovic, a prominent leader in the alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic's hubris is a result of strong recent poll numbers for his party, his surprisingly successful cameo performance as a Government minister during the 10-week Kosovo war and a new go-it-alone strategy cooked up by his advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those advisers say Mr. Draskovic was betrayed by other opposition leaders in 1996-97, when he helped lead three months of protest rallies in Belgrade that came tantalizingly close to toppling Mr. Milosevic. They vow that he will not be duped again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the last big round of protests, Mr. Draskovic complained that he was undermined by Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic Party and the other big fish in the opposition sea. In the fall of 1997, Mr. Djindjic encouraged opposition parties to boycott an election when Mr. Draskovic ran for president of Serbia. The boycott contributed to Mr. Draskovic's dismal third-place showing in the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never again will he trust Mr. Djindjic or other &quot;very selfish&quot; opposition leaders, Mr. Draskovic said, as he painted a dark scenario of what he believes would happen if he were to participate in an opposition alliance before an election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Immediately before elections, they will start to quarrel, to accuse each other, to blackmail each other, and Milosevic would see a way to manipulate them,&quot; said Mr. Draskovic. &quot;He would use smoke, coffee, whiskey and be very, very satisfied by the stupid ambitions of the opposition. No. I am not a part of it. I tried for nine years to unify them without any success. O.K. That's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Draskovic, who has been severely beaten and imprisoned in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests, stunned many in Serbia in January when he accepted the Serbian leader's invitation to join the Yugoslav Government as a Deputy Prime Minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the war, he attracted attention by condemning the NATO bombing of civilian targets in Serbia as brutal and inhuman. He demanded that the foreign press be allowed to operate inside Serbia and distanced himself from Mr. Milosevic, accusing his Government of lying to the Serbian people about who was winning the war in Kosovo. In late April, he was dismissed, but not before he had shown himself as a strongly nationalist yet sane alternative to Mr. Milosevic's policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I prevented many stupid things from happening during the war,&quot; Mr. Draskovic boasted today. &quot;I risked my life. I did my obligations. I did it by staying in Serbia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of Mr. Draskovic's critics here believe that the real reason he is reluctant to take on the Milosevic Government is that he does not want to lose his political trump card, Studio B television. The station, a real alternative to state-controlled television, is run by Belgrade City Hall, which is run by a coalition of Mr. Draskovic's party and the ruling Socialists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Vuk pushes too hard, he could lose the support of the Socialists,&quot; said one analyst here. &quot;He could lose Studio B and then he would be in the same position as everybody else in the opposition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about that, Mr. Draskovic was indignant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a total lie,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most vexing complication in the political evolution of Mr. Draskovic is what exactly he believes in. He has been a somewhat promiscuous populist during the last decade, alternating between fist-pounding nationalism and rather sophisticated sensitivity to the rights of ethnic minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with many politicians in Serbia, it is difficult to discern how much nationalism colors his commitment to democracy and human rights. Mr. Draskovic said there is no confusion at all. &quot;My nationalism was always healthy Western nationalism,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Several hundred retired government workers,<BR>carrying placards equating President Slobodan Milosevic with Nazi<BR>leader Adolf Hitler, called for the Yugoslav leader's ouster Thursday<BR>in a march past government buildings still scarred from NATO airstrikes.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wake up, Serbia! Slobo out!&quot; shouted the retired workers, who<BR>were once among Milosevic's strongest supporters. Others stuffed<BR>a mock ballot box with slips of paper to show their desire to<BR>vote against Milosevic, whose term expires in 2001.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, several dozen university students and army reservists<BR>who fought in Kosovo plastered stickers and signs reading &quot;Milosevic:<BR>Get out!&quot; along the city's main pedestrian street.<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police immediately ripped down the stickers and chased off the<BR>demonstrators.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests, rare in the Yugoslav capital in recent years, came<BR>only days after the first large demonstration against Milosevic<BR>and his Communist regime since the end of 11 weeks of NATO airstrikes<BR>on Yugoslavia.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday, nearly 10,000 people, waving Serb flags and chanting<BR>&quot;Resignation,&quot; gathered in the southern city of Cacak to demand<BR>Milosevic's ouster.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 20 other protests are planned for this summer, opposition<BR>leaders said Thursday. Among them: Tuesday in the Yugoslav city<BR>of Uzice, southwest of Belgrade; July 8 in Prokuplje, southeast<BR>of Belgrade; and July 16 in Kraljevo, south of Belgrade.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have two aims: Milosevic's resignation and early, free and<BR>fair elections,&quot; says Vladen Batic, head of an umbrella opposition<BR>group called Alliance for Change. &quot;We want this regime to go<BR>in a peaceful, democratic way. We'll go from town to town, from<BR>house to house, from man to man and light the torch of democracy<BR>in Serbia.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Yugoslavs say Milosevic's political problems help the effort<BR>to oust him. The Yugoslav leader, they note, has:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Allowed NATO peacekeepers to assume control of the sacred<BR>Serb province of Kosovo.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Been indicted as an international war criminal.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Been denounced by the Serbian Orthodox Church for Serbia's<BR>lack of democracy.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Sparked the political and economic isolation of Yugoslavia.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Presided over an increasingly deteriorating economy.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is our moment. Now is the time for change,&quot; says Cedomir<BR>Radoskovic, executive director of the Civic Alliance for Serbia,<BR>an opposition group.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But few here expect the badly divided opposition to capitalize<BR>on growing public discontent. &quot;We're racked with problems,&quot;<BR>says Miroslav Filipovic, vice president of Civic Alliance. &quot;It<BR>all comes down to pride and ego. Yes, ego. Everyone wants to lead,<BR>and no one wants to follow.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Divisions are so great that many opposition groups refuse to talk<BR>to one another; their leaders won't appear in the same room. Others<BR>openly criticize one another in the media and discourage attendance<BR>at rival groups' rallies.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last three attempts to oust Milosevic -- in 1991, 1993 and<BR>1996 -- failed because of such lack of unity. These deep divisions<BR>once again offer Milosevic his best hope for political survival,<BR>at least in the near term, analysts say.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Milosevic couldn't ask for a better opposition to suit his purposes,&quot;<BR>says Branislav Vujinovic, head of the Belgrade Chamber of Commerce.<BR>&quot;Nothing will be accomplished and nothing will be changed if<BR>these people don't stop fighting. Every one of them appears to<BR>put his own agenda ahead of the good of the nation.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal Party, for example,<BR>is the only opposition leader with a sizable following. Polls<BR>show that 15% of Yugoslavia's 11 million people would vote for<BR>him as the next president, second only to Milosevic, with 21%.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tall, bearded writer, widely criticized for his healthy ego,<BR>denounces the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protests held earlier this week.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not the time for change,&quot; Draskovic, 52, said in an<BR>interview. &quot;When the time has come, I will announce it. There<BR>is no point participating in these pointless street rallies. I<BR>am not ready.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic says he has every reason to refuse to cooperate with<BR>his &quot;selfish, egocentric&quot; opposition colleagues.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996 and 1997, Draskovic led three months of protests that<BR>came close to toppling the Milosevic regime. He then decided to<BR>run for president of Serbia, one of the two republics that make<BR>up Yugoslavia.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But U.S. officials in the Balkans who recently met with nine opposition<BR>leaders in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro aren't so sure.<BR>They privately criticize the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> calling it weak<BR>and pitiful.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By WILLIAM YARDLEY</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section A; Column 0; Obituary; Pg. 30</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">947 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Srdja Popovic, a Serbian lawyer and celebrated human rights advocate who pressed for reform and free speech for five decades, first under Communist rule in the former Yugoslavia and later under the strongman Slobodan Milosevic and his successors, died on Tuesday in Belgrade. He was 76.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His death was confirmed by his family's law firm, Popovic, Popovic, Samardzija &amp; Popovic, which was founded by his father, Miodrag, in 1933.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Popovic's principal work was representing commercial clients, many of them international. But in the late 1960s he began a side career defending writers, artists and political dissidents who dared to criticize Communist Yugoslavia. By the mid-1970s he had become one of the accused -- and something of an international cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre because of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1976, Mr. Popovic was sentenced to a year in prison for ''maliciously spreading false information and causing public disorder,'' the Communist authorities declared. His supposed crime was agreeing with the views of a client, a dissident and poet named Dragoljub S. Ignjatovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges stemmed from courtroom arguments that Mr. Popovic had made two years earlier, when he tried to introduce evidence supporting Mr. Ignjatovic's claim that Yugoslavia's economic policies were failing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than two weeks after Mr. Popovic was sentenced, and after international human rights and legal groups had publicized his case, a group of 106 prominent American lawyers signed a petition asking President Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia to free him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The signers included Ramsey Clark, the attorney general under President Lyndon B. Johnson; Telford Taylor, a lead prosecutor at the Nuremberg war-crimes trials after World War II; and Cyrus R. Vance, the president of the New York City Bar Association, who would be named secretary of state by President Jimmy Carter the next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeals court suspended Mr. Popovic's sentence in late May, though it banned him from practicing law for a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Popovic (his full name is pronounced SIR-ja POE-pa-vich) went on to represent more dissidents. In 1984, he was asked to defend many of the so-called Belgrade Six, a group of Yugoslavs charged with holding meetings for the purpose of ''abolishing the existing government.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dubiousness of the charges -- the meetings were public and had gone on for years -- and the Yugoslav authorities' treatment of Mr. Popovic drew international attention. As he was preparing his case, prosecutors listed him as a potential witness, disqualifying him under Yugoslav law from serving as a defense lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Yugoslavia splintered and Mr. Milosevic rose to power in the late 1980s advocating Serbian nationalism, Mr. Popovic was among the first to speak out against him. A magazine he started in 1990 -- its title, Vreme, means ''time'' in Serbian -- became a leading </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When Milosevic 'cleansed' the media, we suddenly got a lot of reporters,'' Mr. Popovic said in a 2011 interview with a Slovenian weekly. ''This was an excellent opportunity to do something.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He left Yugoslavia the next year to live in the United States, in part because of the political climate under Mr. Milosevic. Later, as the Bosnian war expanded, he accused many Serbs, even opponents of Mr. Milosevic, of allowing Serbian nationalism to blind them to their complicity in widespread brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The people are sunk in their passivity because they know they are guilty,'' he told The New York Times in 1997. ''They know the lies they took in -- they know they triumphed when Sarajevo was bombed. As a nation they have lost all self-respect.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He returned to Belgrade in 2000, after Mr. Milosevic was ousted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, he represented the family of the former Serbian prime minister Zoran Djindjic, who was assassinated in 2003. Mr. Djindjic, a reformer who sought alliances with Europe, allowed for Mr. Milosevic and others to be extradited to The Hague to face war-crimes charges. Mr. Popovic argued that the assassination was essentially a coup attempt by nationalist supporters that involved far more than the 12 members of the secret police and organized crime who were convicted in the killing in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Popovic was born on Feb. 24, 1937, in Belgrade. His name sometimes appears with the middle initial M., a Serbian custom that signifies the first letter of his father's first name. He received his law degree from the University of Belgrade in 1961.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His survivors include his wife and four children. He is not related to a prominent younger man of the same name who was among the leaders of Otpor, a student group whose demonstrations helped lead to the ouster of Mr. Milosevic in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1970s, Mr. Popovic was a founding partner of the World Association of Lawyers, which focused on international legal issues. In the 1980s he was part of a prominent group of lawyers who tried to end the death penalty in Yugoslavia, where executions were carried out by firing squad. In the early '90s he was president of the European </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Serbia, which supports integration with the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Popovic represented a wide range of clients, not just those whose political views he might share. He represented people accused of war crimes and political leaders who supported brutal violence. In the shifting and often confusing alliances and divisions of Balkan politics, he said one constant should be the right of everyone to an honest justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''My father had an idealistic understanding that a lawyer is most needed for those who have many enemies, and those are political prisoners,'' he once said. ''Against them are the media, the state, the court, the prosecution, and sometimes even their family.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has lost four wars in the past decade and seen his dream of a Greater Serbia shrivel as it became a pariah state. He has presided over the collapse of the economy and watched his army retreat from the nation's most hallowed plot of ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet more than four months after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic bowed to NATO demands and pulled his troops out of Kosovo, the world's only indicted war criminal to be running a country remains safely ensconced in his hilltop palace outside Belgrade, where he continues to shape the destiny of Europe's most volatile region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Serbia's 10 million citizens approach what promises to be an agonizing winter, the likelihood of a bloody political confrontation seems greater than at any time since the 1996 street marches protesting the outcome of local elections nearly toppled Milosevic. Yet interviews with more than a dozen prominent politicians, economists, writers and academics reflect mounting fears that Milosevic may again turn his people's adversity to his advantage and sustain his reign indefinitely beyond the 10 years he has already served.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a glance, the Yugoslav leader's situation would appear untenable. He is isolated by the West, key domestic allies have abandoned him and support for his Socialist Party is deteriorating rapidly. The economy is in a shambles and sources of government funds used to ensure loyalty have all but dried up. Army officers are reported to be dismayed by what they view as a political capitulation, rather than a military defeat, in the Kosovo war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the opening this month of a newly rebuilt railway station in Leskovac, Milosevic acknowledged for the first time that living standards were dropping. &quot;Nobody has to tell us that we are going through difficult times that may get worse,&quot; he said. The biting effect of economic sanctions, especially targeted measures such as the ban on 308 Milosevic allies from traveling to 28 countries, have eroded support for the Yugoslav leader even among those considered to be his cronies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that Milosevic is going public much more often than in the past is a sign that he is nervous,&quot; said Ivan Vejvoda, executive director of the Fund for an Open Society Yugoslavia, backed by U.S. financier George Soros. &quot;He knows that a solid majority of the people are now against him and he no longer has the resources, let alone the backing of the West, to prop up his position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yugoslav army is another source of anxiety for Milosevic, who has never enjoyed good relations with what Momcilo Perisic, a former armed forces chief of staff, calls &quot;the last democratic institution left in the country.&quot; Military sources say there have been six foiled coup attempts against the president since 1989, and he has regularly removed top generals to prevent any of them from becoming too ambitious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Milosevic has changed a lot in the past few months,&quot; says Bratislav Grubacic, a Belgrade editor who maintains close ties with the government and the opposition. &quot;He has grown much more temperamental and does not like to hear bad news. He used to listen to other viewpoints, but now he gives monologues and is surrounded by yes men. Most of all, it kills him that none of those famous Western statesmen come to visit him anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Milosevic's foes, at home and abroad, have learned to their chagrin not to make premature predictions about his downfall. He maintains absolute control over the police, the banks and the electronic media. He exercises an authoritarian rule that helps him deflate dissent and confuse his opponents. Most of all, he manipulates his political rivals with ruthless guile, leaving many opponents in despair over Serbia's prospects of evolving into a mature democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Milosevic has used every war--with Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and now Kosovo--to consolidate his power,&quot; said Zoran Djindjic, head of the Democratic Party and a leader of the opposition alliance. &quot;Whenever he feels weak, he provokes a crisis and seizes upon it as an opportunity to secure even greater control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Djindjic and other foes of the government, the Kosovo war ended in the worst possible way. The southern province, revered as the soul of the Serbian nation for more than six centuries, was severed from the homeland and placed under an international protectorate. The refugee burden has grown to staggering proportions, with 700,000 homeless Serbs seeking shelter. Relations with the republic of Montenegro, which along with Serbia forms what is left of the Yugoslav federation, were strained to the breaking point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damage from the war and international sanctions has nearly ruined the economy, accelerating an exodus of Serbia's best and brightest that has seen 300,000 educated professionals flee the country in the past 10 years. Facing the truth about the brutal deportation of Kosovo Albanians has plunged many Serbs into a state of moral depression, making them feel, as one writer says, &quot;like the Nazis of the Nineties.&quot; And worst of all, Milosevic still retains his grip on power--with no promise that he will soon let go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People here feel doubly betrayed, by Milosevic and by the West,&quot; said Svetozar Cvetkovic, a well-known actor and theater director. &quot;He tricked us into believing life would get better when it only got worse. And the West made us believe they would destroy Milosevic and his war machine, but instead they bombed the cities and people that have been trying to get rid of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the antipathy toward the West evident during the war, as demonstrators ridiculed NATO bombs by wearing mock targets, has subsided. But so has much of the energy that motivated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protesters to take to the streets last month for nightly demonstrations to persuade the government to call early elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Milosevic has sought to demoralize his opposition by exploiting the rivalry between his two principal challengers, Djindjic and Vuk Draskovic, the head of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ever since 1996, when protests erupted after Milosevic tried to block an opposition victory in local elections, Djindjic and Draskovic have fought for control of Belgrade city hall and tried to undermine each other's political fortunes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early this month, Draskovic was injured in a traffic accident that killed his brother-in-law and three bodyguards after a huge truck veered into their caravan on an open highway. When the truck could not be traced by authorities and the driver escaped, Draskovic accused the government of trying to assassinate him because of fears that his popularity was becoming a direct challenge to Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to be outdone, Djindjic this week accused Milosevic and his powerful wife, Mirjana Markovic, of ordering security forces to plot his own assassination. He said police were taking pictures of his residence and scrutinizing the weapons of his bodyguards in preparation for an attack on his life. &quot;This kind of organized terrorism shows how nervous Milosevic is getting,&quot; Djindjic said. &quot;The only way to stop it is by bringing it to the attention of the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far from outraging the public, the rival assassination claims by Djindjic and Draskovic seem only to have deepened their animosity and held the two up to greater ridicule. During the war, both men found their reputations sullied. Draskovic's position of deputy prime minister held him open to charges of collaborating with Milosevic, while Djindjic was called a coward after fleeing Belgrade for the relative safety of Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why would anybody want to kill these guys?&quot; said Vojislav Seselj, the ultranationalist leader of the Serbian Radical Party that is allied with Milosevic. &quot;We should be offering to provide for their protection. They are the ideal opposition because they will never be capable of coming to power.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOVI SAD, Serbia, Sept. 23</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition demonstrations against President Slobodan Milosevic may be faltering in cynical Belgrade, but 60 miles to the north, in Vojvodina, there is both energy and direction, with politicians' planning for a long-term effort to undermine the credibility of the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 10,000 protesters have turned out nightly this week in the provincial capital, Novi Sad -- sometimes more than in Belgrade, but in a city of some 200,000 people, one-tenth the size of the capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here, a portly, charismatic politician named Nenad Canak has focused the protests on installing a new &quot;transitional&quot; parliament and government for the province. Those new officials, including Mr. Canak as provisional prime minister, will now seek to win Western recognition for themselves and Western aid for Novi Sad and Vojvodina, to emphasize the international isolation of the Milosevic Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Canak, a good speaker with a sense of irony, has encouraged his protesters to clean the parliament building with soap and water to wash away the &quot;corruption and filth&quot; of the Milosevic years, as plainclothes policemen watched from inside. On Thursday, the &quot;new&quot; officials were &quot;sworn in&quot; on the parliament steps, as existing officials were urged to vacate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they do not, protesters say they will lock the existing officials (and the police) in the building, block the phone lines with automatic dialers and try to burn out the fax machines by sending black pages, then cut water and electricity to the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Kosovo, Vojvodina had its autonomy stripped by Mr. Milosevic in 1990, and this spring NATO's bombers hit it hard, destroying Novi Sad's oil refinery, hitting its Government building and demolishing its three bridges over the Danube River. That cut the city in half, ruining water and power lines and blocking the Danube to international shipping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With much fanfare, the Milosevic Government has just opened a two-lane bridge resting on orange barges a few feet above the river. The bridge is a key part of Mr. Milosevic's effort to &quot;reconstruct the country&quot; while the protesters, according to state propaganda, try to finish the war NATO started by bringing him down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Mr. Canak, 39 and a former member of the Serbian parliament, Mr. Milosevic is less the issue than Vojvodina's stolen autonomy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, Mr. Canak will organize a gathering in a park, with lots of food and drink, under the rubric, &quot;No one can make a revolution on an empty stomach.&quot; Here in Vojvodina, fun, food and drink are indispensable to any serious activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's theater, yes, but not only theater,&quot; he said. &quot;You can attract people with theater, but there must be some substance, too, some action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Canak and his allies are concentrating not on the rallies, which will not continue here past the weekend on a daily basis, but on creating substance behind the idea of an alternative government that will restore some autonomy to the province. &quot;I'm going to demand some immediate support from the West,&quot; he says, &quot;and I think I'll get some.&quot; He wants food, heating oil, diesel fuel, transformers and cement -- so he can provide aid to people, even to the local police and military, that the Government cannot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Canak and others here complain that the West, both governments and media, are too Belgrade-centric, ignoring the needs and concerns of other parts of Serbia, where the opposition to Mr. Milosevic is stronger. Little Western aid comes here, for instance, and Vojvodina has little local media, despite having more than 2 million inhabitants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Canak is sometimes attacked by Belgrade as a &quot;separatist&quot; or treated as a quasi-nationalist, he has built his political career in the last decade on local issues. His League of Social Democrats is refurbishing a large building downtown with offices, a library, radio station, generators, presses, a small cinema and a cafe, both to earn income and also try to be self-sufficient in the political struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to start making some problems here,&quot; he says happily. &quot;Milosevic's tactic for survival is always to wait and see. We can't allow that. They underestimate us all the time, which is to our advantage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the rally, Mr. Canak delighted the crowd with coarse jibes at Mr. Milosevic and the secret police, whose cameras he identified, red lights blinking, in darkened rooms in surrounding buildings. &quot;Look at that window there, say hello, and put on a big smile,&quot; he told the crowd, which cheered, pointed and whistled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Come down here and show your real face,&quot; he yelled, as the camera was pulled back. &quot;There are no terrorists here. Just the free people of Vojvodina who don't want you any more.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A long line of Western diplomats made their way to Belgrade to call on Slobodan Milosevic in the 1990s. As president of Serbia and later Federal Yugoslavia, Milosevic was deemed to have superhuman powers to stop his country's descent into drunken rape, looting, torture, house-burning and murder. &quot;Of course we all knew Milosevic was the biggest part of the problem right from the outset,&quot; a British diplomat told the journalist and author Adam LeBor. &quot;But what took longer for us to get was that he could never also be part of the solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diplomatic visits stroked the nationalist leader's ego, and confirmed his belief that the international community would not move to stop the &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; of former Yugoslavia. &quot;Negotiating with Milosevic became a badge of pride for many politicians,&quot; a former Yugoslav minister of justice lamented to LeBor. &quot;It was very important for their careers to have negotiated with this mighty, ruthless ruler.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two former British foreign secretaries, David Owen and Douglas Hurd, come badly out of LeBor's book. Lord Owen and his wife Debbie cultivated a personal friendship with Milosevic and his wife Mira, flying in a helicopter to lunch with them in one of Tito's former palaces and offering publishing advice to Mira. In August 1992, five months after the Bosnian war started, Owen said, &quot;Now it is clear that Milosevic really wants peace&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after he joined NatWest Markets, Douglas Hurd brokered a contract to privatise Serbian Telecom, worth US$ 1 billion to the Milosevic regime. In the mid-1990s, it &quot;seemed possible&quot; that Serbia under Milosevic would &quot;move towards economic and political liberalisation&quot;, Hurd claimed in his own defence. The US ambassador to the UN, Richard Holbrooke, also took pride in his chummy relationship with Milosevic, receiving him royally at Dayton in November 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question raised by these excellent accounts of the rise and fall of Slobodan Milosevic is why it took so long for the West to see the Serb leader for the duplicitous bully he was, and why it took so long to act. In December 1992, the outgoing US Secretary of State, Lawrence Eagleburger, identified Milosevic as one of 10 suspected war criminals who should be brought to trial. Yet Milosevic was coddled by the West for the better part of another six years. As late as February 1998, the US envoy Robert Gelbard praised Milosevic's &quot;significant positive influence&quot; in Bosnia and described the Kosovo Liberation Army - lionised by Washington the following year - as &quot;without any questions, a terrorist group&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic told a Croatian envoy that the late militia leader Arkan did &quot;certain kinds of dirty work for me&quot;. His government armed, trained and paid the Bosnian Serbs who did most of the killing. But it is doubtful the prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) can prove that Milosevic personally ordered the murder of 255 people in Vukovar Hospital in November 1991, the massacre of more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslims at Srebenica in July 1995, or the killing of 45 ethnic Albanians at Racak, Kosovo, in January 1999. Milosevic stands accused of the most serious crimes known - including genocide - and judges may conclude that the mere demonstration of &quot;command responsibility&quot; is insufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is easy to find parallels with Saddam Hussein's Iraq in this sorry tale. In March 1991, Milosevic was nearly overthrown during 10 days of student protests during which demonstrators shouted, &quot;Slobo, Saddam! Slobo, Saddam!&quot; Milosevic's trial could deter other leaders from committing war crimes in the future, Michael Scharf, a prominent international lawyer, and William Schabas, director of the Irish Centre for Human Rights at NUI Galway, concludes. From Baghdad, be sure Saddam is contemplating Milosevic's fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LeBor brings to life the neurotic, lunatic and sometimes tragic personalities of Milosevic, his wife Mira and their spoiled children Marija and Marko. As a school boy in Pozaravec, Milosovevic's mother Stanislava sent him out in a fresh white shirt every day, &quot;like a junior version of the Communist official she hoped he would be&quot;. He made few friends and disliked sports, but when he met Mira Markovic the teenagers became inseparable and their classmates referred to them as Romeo and Juliet. They shared unhappy childhoods; Slobodan's father left his mother, and both of his parents eventually committed suicide. Mira's mother, a member of the resistance, was killed by the Nazis when Mira was an infant. Her father founded a new family and didn't want to know her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, the couple would more often be compared to the MacBeths. After Slobodan was arrested on March 31st 2001, Mira brought a packed lunch to his Belgrade prison every day. According to a former prison guard, the two spent an hour holding hands, kissing and stroking each others' faces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Milosevic, as an ambitious apparatchik with a limp handshake, nor Mira, a frumpy intellectual snob, is an appealing character. There is a clue to Milosevic's cruelty in the recollections of a British diplomat, David Austin, quoted by LeBor. &quot;Nothing seemed to affect him emotionally; any kind of human suffering just did not register. He never once expressed any sympathy. Apart from his family, people were just nothing to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Milosevic children seem to have inherited their parents' worst characteristics. Marija treats her depression with her mother's tranquillizers and fell in love with her bodyguard, a former criminal. Marko has been on the run in the former Soviet Union since his father's arrest.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tardy reversal in the US attitude towards Milosevic; the cowardice of Europe and the UN in dealing with him; US assistance to Croatian forces who &quot;ethnically cleansed&quot; Serbs from the Krajina region; the decision not to arrest the wanted war criminals Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic . . . are but a few of the failings that leave us with a sense of unease.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A long line of Western diplomats made their way to Belgrade to call on Slobodan Milosevic in the 1990s. As president of Serbia and later Federal Yugoslavia, Milosevic was deemed to have superhuman powers to stop his country's descent into drunken rape, looting, torture, house-burning and murder. &quot;Of course we all knew Milosevic was the biggest part of the problem right from the outset,&quot; a British diplomat told the journalist and author Adam LeBor. &quot;But what took longer for us to get was that he could never also be part of the solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diplomatic visits stroked the nationalist leader's ego, and confirmed his belief that the international community would not move to stop the &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; of former Yugoslavia. &quot;Negotiating with Milosevic became a badge of pride for many politicians,&quot; a former Yugoslav minister of justice lamented to LeBor. &quot;It was very important for their careers to have negotiated with this mighty, ruthless ruler.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two former British foreign secretaries, David Owen and Douglas Hurd, come badly out of LeBor's book. Lord Owen and his wife Debbie cultivated a personal friendship with Milosevic and his wife Mira, flying in a helicopter to lunch with them in one of Tito's former palaces and offering publishing advice to Mira. In August 1992, five months after the Bosnian war started, Owen said, &quot;Now it is clear that Milosevic really wants peace&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after he joined NatWest Markets, Douglas Hurd brokered a contract to privatise Serbian Telecom, worth US$ 1 billion to the Milosevic regime. In the mid-1990s, it &quot;seemed possible&quot; that Serbia under Milosevic would &quot;move towards economic and political liberalisation&quot;, Hurd claimed in his own defence. The US ambassador to the UN, Richard Holbrooke, also took pride in his chummy relationship with Milosevic, receiving him royally at Dayton in November 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question raised by these excellent accounts of the rise and fall of Slobodan Milosevic is why it took so long for the West to see the Serb leader for the duplicitous bully he was, and why it took so long to act. In December 1992, the outgoing US Secretary of State, Lawrence Eagleburger, identified Milosevic as one of 10 suspected war criminals who should be brought to trial. Yet Milosevic was coddled by the West for the better part of another six years. As late as February 1998, the US envoy Robert Gelbard praised Milosevic's &quot;significant positive influence&quot; in Bosnia and described the Kosovo Liberation Army - lionised by Washington the following year - as &quot;without any questions, a terrorist group&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic told a Croatian envoy that the late militia leader Arkan did &quot;certain kinds of dirty work for me&quot;. His government armed, trained and paid the Bosnian Serbs who did most of the killing. But it is doubtful the prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) can prove that Milosevic personally ordered the murder of 255 people in Vukovar Hospital in November 1991, the massacre of more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslims at Srebenica in July 1995, or the killing of 45 ethnic Albanians at Racak, Kosovo, in January 1999. Milosevic stands accused of the most serious crimes known - including genocide - and judges may conclude that the mere demonstration of &quot;command responsibility&quot; is insufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is easy to find parallels with Saddam Hussein's Iraq in this sorry tale. In March 1991, Milosevic was nearly overthrown during 10 days of student protests during which demonstrators shouted, &quot;Slobo, Saddam! Slobo, Saddam!&quot; Milosevic's trial could deter other leaders from committing war crimes in the future, Michael Scharf, a prominent international lawyer, and William Schabas, director of the Irish Centre for Human Rights at NUI Galway, concludes. From Baghdad, be sure Saddam is contemplating Milosevic's fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LeBor brings to life the neurotic, lunatic and sometimes tragic personalities of Milosevic, his wife Mira and their spoiled children Marija and Marko. As a school boy in Pozaravec, Milosovevic's mother Stanislava sent him out in a fresh white shirt every day, &quot;like a junior version of the Communist official she hoped he would be&quot;. He made few friends and disliked sports, but when he met Mira Markovic the teenagers became inseparable and their classmates referred to them as Romeo and Juliet. They shared unhappy childhoods; Slobodan's father left his mother, and both of his parents eventually committed suicide. Mira's mother, a member of the resistance, was killed by the Nazis when Mira was an infant. Her father founded a new family and didn't want to know her.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE outspoken Serbian political leader Vuk Draskovic was sacked from his post as deputy prime minister yesterday, in a clear sign that President Slobodan Milosevic will not tolerate opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent days, Mr Draskovic has called for a diplomatic compromise to end the NATO air strikes, and criticised Mr Milosevic's propaganda machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last night, Mr Draskovic was visibly shaken as he announced his sacking at a press conference in the city-centre headquarters of his political party, the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was informed of his dismissal by a fax from Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic, one of Mr Milosevic's most loyal lieutenants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My party and I will continue to fight for (our principles),&quot; said Mr Draskovic, a former opposition leader who joined the government four months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sacking came just hours after the NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea, praised him as an emblem of hope in an authoritarian regime. &quot;Beneath the permafrost there are some green shoots of democratic recovery,&quot; Mr Shea had said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the comments of Mr Shea, and those of other western officials, clearly did Mr Draskovic no favours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Previously, NATO had given its support to an independent radio station in Belgrade, B-92, only for it to be kicked off the air the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last night, Mr Draskovic urged reporters not to interpret the firing as a sign of division inside Yugoslavia. &quot;All Serbs are united in readiness to protect Kosovo,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic had been in dispute with the government over a Belgrade television station he controlled, Studio B. He began making his controversial comments - that an armed UN presence in Kosovo should be accepted - on Studio B last Sunday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When censors came to the station to supervise the news programme the next day, Mr Draskovic threatened to lead street demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Studio B, apparently now under state control, was the only station to immediately announce the dismissal, saying Mr Draskovic was sacked &quot;because his public announcements are out of the official policy - and because of that he has undermined the authority of the federal government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Draskovic, a well-known writer, is a Serbian nationalist who believes in the restoration of the monarchy. He was beaten and jailed for anti-war protests in 1993 and led hundreds of thousands of Serbs in demonstrations against Mr Milosevic in 1996-97.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has been a long-time advocate for freedom of the press, and is a favourite of western journalists in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before Mr Draskovic's sacking, a second senior government minister admitted that Belgrade was tiring of the military campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Goran Matic, the federal information minister, said the regime would like to see an end to the air attacks and that a negotiated settlement could be decided upon within the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While stressing that Yugoslavia would never give up Kosovo, he said: &quot;Everything else we'll give NATO for their victory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Matic is closer to the ruling circles of Mr Milosevic than Mr Draskovic, who has not even met the premier since the air assault began. His intervention is widely seen as more significant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking to the New York Times, Mr Matic - a member of the Yugoslav United Left party of Mr Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic - said that, with Moscow's help, diplomacy was making progress and the basis for a negotiated agreement could soon be settled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I believe that this will be the week in which the basic outline of an agreement on Kosovo can be firmed up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yugoslavia would like to see the allied campaign stop but not at any price, he said. &quot;We have a national interest in this. But it's in America's interest as well, and at one point our interests will intersect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was no word last night on any reaction from Mr Milosevic to Mr Matic's comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, a source close to the Milosevic regime said he was not optimistic about a diplomatic compromise to end the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said of Mr Milosevic: &quot;He would rather lose two million Serbian lives than make a deal with NATO.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Mr Milosevic was becoming a legend in rural parts of Serbia, much like Prince Lazar, the Serbian leader who lost the Battle of Kosovo Polje in 1389. &quot;A compromise for Milosevic means the opening of 1,000 problems he can't control,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Sooner or later it will lead to his removal from power. What can he offer the people in a time of peace? People will start to ask why they don't have jobs, a car or any petrol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Mr Draskovic said he would not respond to the sacking by organising a resistance to Mr Milosevic, there are signs his boldness has encouraged other opposition leaders to make their voices heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dusan Mihailovic, the president of the New Democracy party, said: &quot;Draskovic encouraged other parties to come out from their mouse holes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there is still extreme fear in Belgrade that speaking out against Mr Milosevic can be dangerous. A prominent journalist, Slavko Curuvija, wrote </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> articles in the weeks leading up to the air strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was shot dead in broad daylight two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources in NATO were interested by the developments in Belgrade. Speaking before Mr Draskovic's sacking, one long-standing observer of Mr Milosevic's tactics in both the Bosnian war and the latest conflict in Kosovo said it was significant that any criticism had been allowed to be aired at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The comments from Mr Matic could signify the Yugoslav president was desperately exploring an exit strategy that would be acceptable to both the allied high command and to the Serb people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's classic Dayton. He (Mr Milosevic) held out on the Rambouillet agreement which would have granted him far more rights than he can negotiate now to engineer a climbdown that he can paint as a victory to his own people,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AS SLOBODAN Milosevic's once unquestioned power bleeds away and erstwhile allies turn into potential prosecution witnesses, the day is drawing closer when the Serbian president could stand before the war crimes tribunal in The Hague charged with responsibility for the worst atrocities in Europe since the Holocaust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In interviews with the Guardian, a former paramilitary commander, a sacked police chief, and a senior member of Milosevic's leftwing coalition have described how a small group of Serbian secret policemen under Milosevic's direct control co-ordinated a covert dirty war by arming thousands of convicts and sending them to fight in Croatia and Bosnia. From April 1991 until the end of the war in late 1995, these paramilitary groups, such as the Serbian Cetnik </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Arkan's Tigers, carried out a murderous campaign of ethnic cleansing and looting across a large swathe of the former Yugoslavia. Pulling the strings from the shadows was a small group of men from the State Security Department of the Serbian interior ministry, appointed by Milosevic and totally loyal to him. Within the ministry, they were known as the 'vojna linija' ('military line').</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This new evidence of a parallel chain of command is crucial to any future indictment against Milosevic, who also appears to have lost the diplomatic protection he enjoyed when the West viewed him as a guarantor of peace in Bosnia. He is now seen more as a source of instability. It is no longer inconceivable that The Hague could issue an indictment against Milosevic, making him the world's highest-ranking war crimes defendant since Hermann Goering stood in the dock at Nuremberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Witnesses name three key figures in the vojna linija responsible for arming and training paramilitaries - Radovan 'Badza' Stojicic, Franko 'Frenki' Simatovic, and Mihalj Kertes. They worked for Jovica Stanisic, the head of Milosevic's secret police. Kertes was also Milosevic's 'minister for the Serb diaspora', providing him with a pretext for constant travel in Croatia and Bosnia. All these men now hold powerful positions in the Milosevic regime. One key source, Branislav Vakic, first met Badza in May 1991, in the eastern Slavonia region of Croatia. Vakic, a former boxing champion from Serbia's second city of Nis, was determined to fight for his kin at a time when Yugoslavia was imploding, and skirmishes were breaking out between Serbs and Croats. Vakic came with a bearded band of adventurers and freed convicts calling themselves the Serbian Cetnik </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> under the leadership of a bespectacled history professor called Vojislav Seselj. When the Cetniks slouched into eastern Slovenia, many were carrying only hunting rifles. Badza soon put that right. 'MUP (the interior ministry) started to help the Cetniks in May', says Vakic. 'The MUP forces at that time were under Radovan Stojicic - 'Badza'. We just got weapons from them then. But we started to act together in January 1993, in Skelani and towards Srebrenica.' By the time the Cetniks moved on to Bosnia, Vakic was in charge of 6,000 men. Badza moved into Bosnia at the same time. His influence is clear from some photographs Vakic proudly displays in his offices in Nis. A picture from 1991 shows him and a handful of fellow Cetniks brandishing a few 1940s Thompson machineguns. Two years later, in a snap taken near Srebrenica, Vakic is posing with a sophisticated sniper rifle complete with foot-long silencer and telescopic scope. 'We got uniforms from MUP, and the weapons we wanted: infantry weapons, machineguns, sniper rifles with night scopes and mortars,' he recalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In early 1992, Vakic says his men were trained at a military base near Belgrade, called Bubanj Potok. Later in 1992 and 1993, his Cetniks were moved down to a new base at Bajina Basta (on the Bosnian border) where they met 'Frenki' Simatovic, who ran an interior ministry special forces unit, known as the 'red berets'. Frenki not only trained Vakic's men, he accompanied them in forays against Muslims as the war spread into Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'From September to October 1992 (months after Yugoslav forces had officially 'withdrawn' from Bosnia) we fought with Frenki's units in Bratunac (a Bosnian town near Srebrenica). They were good but they didn't fight with the same heart as true nationalists,' adds Vakic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In August 1993, he sent 300 of his men for further training in a Serbian interior ministry on Mount Tara, near Bajina Basta, but says the relationship with Frenki's men broke down soon afterwards when they tried to make them leave the Radical Party.  The red berets, he says, were loyal only to Milosevic and his Serbian Socialist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VOjislav Seselj, Vakic's boss in both the Cetniks and the Radical Party, has also told journalists how his men fought alongside the red berets, mentioning not only Frenki but also Mihalj Kertes as their commanders. Kertes is also named as a red berets commander by another Serb warlord, Dragoslav Bokan, now in jail for armed robbery. While Frenki took over as the Cetniks' handler in eastern Bosnia, Badza linked up with Zeljko 'Arkan' Raznjatovic and his notorious Tigers militia. Marko Nicovic, a former Belgrade police chief, says that Badza formed a 'special relationship with Arkan in eastern Slovenia.' From that moment on, he adds, Arkan, a former bank robber with a long and international criminal record, became untouchable. The 1991 photograph (above) amply illustrates that 'special relationship.' Arkan and Badza are standing together smiling in front of the Tigers' training centre in Erdut, near the eastern Slovenian front.  Another photograph shows a Jeep emblazoned with Tigers insignia bearing Serbian interior ministry number plates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A well-placed source within Milosevic's ruling coalition goes further than Nicovic, on condition of anonymity. 'Where do you think the guns and Jeeps came from? How do you think Arkan got to all those places? Wherever there was Arkan, there was Badza,' the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arkan's case was not exceptional. According to Nicovic, the doors of Serbia's prisons were thrown open in 1991, and 'thousands' of convicts were released so they could fight in paramilitary groups like the Cetniks and the Tigers. 'The convicts were told, 'if you go to the front line, we will cut your sentence.' They thought 'maybe I can make some wealth there'. They went across the border. For a professional policeman it was a bit strange,' says Nicovic. 'In using criminals, for example as informants, there is always a narrow line you walk along. The police here crossed that line by a mile.' At the time Nicovic was a highly-decorated senior police officer and Badza was a uniformed patrolman. But after Milosevic came to power in 1987, and Stanisic rose with him to the head of Serbian state security, Badza was co-opted and sent away 'for work in Croatia and Bosnia.' When Badza next resurfaced in Belgrade, in 1992, he was made head of Serbia's uniformed police. He had become Nicovic's superior, despite an evident lack of qualifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Below Badza, Frenki and Kertes, there was a network of state security agents who coordinated the process of ethnic cleansing.  At the very start of the Bosnian war in April 1992, paramilitary groups crossed from Serbia into the border town of Zvornik and carried out a series of massacres of Muslims. The killers' transport and coordination was organised by a man calling himself Marko Pavlovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1992 Pavlovic took over the Zvornik territorial defence unit, a supposedly local band of volunteers charged with defending the town in times of crisis. According to a well-informed Serb source in Zvornik at the time, Pavlovic was a member of the Serbian state security service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The evidence of the interior ministry's role in orchestrating the ethnic cleansing campaign has great legal significance.  Milosevic can theoretically disown operations carried out under the command of the Yugoslav National Army, a federal body, while Milosevic was 'merely' the president of one of Yugoslavia's constituent republics, Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although most members of Yugoslavia's collective presidency were little more than Milosevic's puppets, constitutionally speaking, the president had no constitutional authority over the army. But unlike officers in the Jugoslav National Army, the policemen in the vojna linija - as employees of the Serb Republic - were directly appointed and constitutionally accountable to Milosevic. In fact, the Serbian police was instrumental in his conquest of Yugoslavia, storming the federal police headquarters in October 1992 to grab secret service files on political allies and enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Borisav Jovic, who was chairman of the Yugoslav collective presidency when the war started and Milosevic's former right-hand man, makes it clear that the interior ministry was the sole responsibility of his erstwhile mentor. 'Everything to do with state security is the responsibility of the President of the Republic, objectively and on the grounds of the constitution.' In the course of an interview, Jovic (probably with one eye on the Hague) emphatically distances himself from the Serbian interior ministry's wartime activities. 'If anything like you describe existed, it had nothing to do with me, nor was I consulted about that.' The chain of command running from the vojna linija to Milosevic is clear. Not only did the president fail to discipline his men after the revelation of atrocities carried out in areas under their control, he promoted them.  Stanisic, as the head of the state security service, is widely regarded by diplomats as the second most powerful man in Yugoslavia. Frenki remains his deputy. Badza was made a general last year.  Kertes is now director of Customs, a lucrative position with great powers of patronage in Yugoslavia's closed economy.  Bogdanovic has officially retired but still wields more authority in the regime's inner circles than his figurehead successor, Zoran Sokolovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vojna linija circle remains the power behind Milosevic's throne - the sinews of power beneath a skin-deep facade of ministers. They now represent the only prop keeping Milosevic in power. But as his regime begins to crack under the pressure of street protests and international condemnation, this prop is starting to wobble. His henchmen are losing confidence in his judgment and wondering aloud whether their own best interests do not lie in striking a separate deal with the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Branislav Vakic, now the leader of the ultra-right Radical Party in Nis, is furious at the regime's attempt to rig local elections there, and believes Milosevic is bound to fall. In anticipation of that day he has collated a mass of documents he insists will prove he and his men are innocent of any war crimes, and that all the actions they undertook were under the direct command of the Serbian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, another disgruntled Milosevic employee, General Nedjeljko Boskovic, the former head of military intelligence, gave a recent newspaper interview in which he issued a thinly-veiled threat to give evidence against his political superiors to clear his own name. A warrant was instantly issued for his arrest, but he is still at liberty, apparently under the protection of the leaders of Serbia's satellite republic, Montenegro. Asked whether he would go to The Hague, the general replied: 'I didn't participate in war crimes but I can be called as a witness . . . Most probably I will go as a witness.' Another potential witness for the prosecution, Nikola Koljevic, died in a Belgrade hospital last week, after apparently shooting himself in the head. As the Bosnian Serb vice-president during the war, he kept copious notes of all discussions with Milosevic. As he sank into depression in his last days, he is reported to have muttered darkly that history would show how the Bosnian Serbs were betrayed. Other Bosnian Serb leaders indicted by The Hague tribunal have privately let it be known that if caught, they would testify that they were carrying out Milosevic's instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even Milosevic's spymaster, Jovica Stanisic, has intimated through friends and colleagues that he has tried to persuade Milosevic to compromise with the opposition, and has expressed his concern about the growing hardline influence of the president's wife, Mirjana Markovic. He is also involved in a fierce political struggle with Badza for control within the interior ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lawyers at The Hague tribunal insist more hard proof is needed before an indictment against a national leader like Milosevic can be considered. Louise Arbour, the new chief prosecutor, says: 'We will have to show a legal chain of command as stringently as possible. There is no point going to trial without stringent proof, factually pointing to a clear chain of command. That's where you get derailed.' The tribunal is not well-placed to search for the necessary proof. Its small office in Belgrade is concerned mainly with coordinating official visits rather than the collection of evidence. But there are signs of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A senior tribunal lawyer said last week there had been considerable progress towards an indictment of Arkan. The United States said last week it is considering the formation of a snatch-squad to go after war crimes suspects. And the glue holding the 'vojna linija' together may be weakening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the cohesion of the inner circle diminishes, the more wartime secrets come to the surface. Milosevic faces not only the strong possibility of political defeat this year, he now has to contemplate the humiliating transition from Serbia's chief executive to the world's most wanted fugitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rise and slide of Milosevic:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> September 1987: Slobodan Milosevic takes control of Serbian communist party.  He appoints Jovica Stanisic as head of state security in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> January 1990: Milosevic issues decree centralising control over Serbia's police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> April 1990: Serbian Cetnik </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> formed under Vojislav Seselj. Branislav Vakic is a founder member. Arkan's Tigers militia formed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> December 1990: Milosevic elected president of Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 1991: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations in Belgrade, crushed with tanks.  Milosevic appoints Stanisic chief of the Serbian state security service and assistant minister of interior. Franko 'Frenki' Simatovic appointed his deputy. Milosevic announces 'the urgent formation of additional Serb militia units.' Freeing of convicts for paramilitary duty begins.  Serb-Croat fighting starts in Plitvice, Croatia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 1991: War begins in Slovenia, as Yugoslavia disintegrates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> January 1992: Radovan 'Badza' Stojicic appointed chief of Serbian public security (uniformed police) and assistant minister of interior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 1992: Yugoslav National Army (JNA) officially withdraws from Bosnia. JNA and Milosevic deny any responsibility for events in Bosnia from this date. But paramilitary units under Badza, Frenki and Mihalj Kertes continue to operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> October 1992: Serbian police forcibly take over Yugoslav federal police HQ and take federal state security files.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> April 1993: First Serb onslaught on the Muslim enclave at Srebrenica.  Paramilitary units, including Cetniks and Arkan's Tigers, take part. After ceasefire, Srebrenica declares a UN 'safe area.' Vakic's Cetniks continue fighting around Srebrenica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> January 1994: Mihalj Kertes appointed director of Customs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> November 1995: Bosnian peace treaty agreed in Dayton, Ohio. Signed in Paris in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1996-97: Belgrade street demonstrations continue over Milosevic's refusal to recognise results of local government elections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should Vojislav Kostunica take office as Yugoslavia's new president, he wants, he says, to help shape a country with a different sense of itself and its place in the world, less isolated and neurotic, a normal European nation with a good dose of skepticism toward American foreign-policy goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a series of conversations in recent weeks, before and after what he and his supporters insist was his victory in elections last Sunday, Mr. Kostunica has outlined a vision broadly like this:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yugoslavia needs to redefine itself, with its republics, Serbia and Montenegro, working out a new relationship if they can, and also needs to work within the United Nations Security Council resolution governing Kosovo to find a modus vivendi that allows Serbs to return there with security, within a democratic, unimperial state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Significantly, he said that Serbia needed to confront its own past, especially in the last decade of Yugoslavia's civil wars. Such a self-examination, he said, has been blocked so far both by the incumbency of Slobodan Milosevic, who helped start those wars, and by the nature of the regime that Mr. Milosevic built: a Communist base infused by nationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kostunica (pronounced kosh-TOON-eet-zah), a 56-year-old constitutional lawyer, said he would favor a form of state &quot;truth commission&quot; of independent historians and experts to examine the crimes and victims of all the parties to the Yugoslav wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a war in the former Yugoslavia, and we must try to face the results and consequences of this war one way or another,&quot; he said. &quot;We must look at everything. I would try to analyze all that -- what happened, how it happened, where do we stand, what we might have avoided, what was not possible to avoid, what are our victims, what are our crimes, what are others' crimes and victims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many who see themselves as victims of the Serbs -- Kosovo's Albanians, Bosnia's Muslims, and Croats in Croatia -- may bridle at such a broad examination, which those attacked often see as a way for Serbs to try to escape blame for their worst crimes. Indeed, Mr. Kostunica has been labeled a nationalist, albeit a moderate one, a description that he said makes him uncomfortable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To me, nationalism is a natural state of mind, to be one who belongs to a nation,&quot; he said. Such national feeling -- which might be called patriotism elsewhere -- is not much different from that felt by the British or the French, he suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the campaign trail, Mr. Kostunica traveled with a small retinue all over Serbia, using Serbian traditions to criticize the socialist regime of Mr. Milosevic, which he said had distorted the country's interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His choice for a national anthem is the Serbian one from the 19th century, he often mentions God in his speeches, and he is proud of his family's bourgeois and anti-Communist traditions. This background fed his defense, in 1974, of a senior professor at Belgrade University who had criticized the Communist government, an action that led to Mr. Kostunica's firing. And in 1989, when Mr. Milosevic, then the relatively new leader of Serbia, offered to rehire those sacked, Mr. Kostunica refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a stop at his native village, Kostunici, he spoke extemporaneously of his family's house, now destroyed, and the values of the Serbia of 150 years ago, before the distortions of Communism. He contrasted the idea of &quot;a real Serbian house, built on real Serbian roots,&quot; to the borrowed architecture of Russia, China and Belarus, Mr. Milosevic's allies. His speech had a touch of mysticism, but it worked with the poor villagers and farmers who came to hear him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had the ring of authenticity and humbleness, which were hallmarks of his campaign as &quot;a normal man,&quot; a Serbian patriot and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world is beginning to understand him better, Mr. Kostunika said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has had much contact lately with the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, especially, given France's current presidency of the European Union. &quot;Vedrine has been open to understanding Serbian patriotism,&quot; Mr. Kostunica said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in his criticism of the United States and its policies, there is more than a touch of the continental European view -- often articulated by the French -- that the &quot;hyperpower&quot; of the United States, with its enormous wealth and capacities, is often unconscious and unheeding of the dignity and interests of other nations. And Americans, he has said, often presume that what they define as good is good for everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But being Serbian and European doesn't mean being anti-American,&quot; Mr. Kostunica said. &quot;I have no stereotypes and prejudices. What concerns me is state interests and policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kostunica, who translated the Federalist Papers into Serbo-Croatian in 1981, does see the Hague tribunal on war crimes in the former Yugoslavia as &quot;an instrument of American policy and not of international law.&quot; He criticizes the tribunal for refusing to examine possible war crimes by NATO leaders for the bombing of civilian targets here (as both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also believe). And he has said that he will not turn Mr. Milosevic, indicted last year for alleged war crimes in Kosovo, over to The Hague for trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kostunica refuses to be explicit now on whether he would turn over Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the two Bosnian Serb leaders indicted by the tribunal. They might be the price for what Mr. Kostunica wants: a re-entry into European institutions like the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the restoration of Yugoslavia as a respected member of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mr. Kostunica, as in many who grew up in Tito's Yugoslavia, there seems to lurk some residue of that old country, which helped found the nonaligned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and lived profitably between East and West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech this week celebrating the victory he claims over Mr. Milosevic, Mr. Kostunica spoke of showing the world &quot;that we are worthy of the tremendous historic task, worthy of our ancestors, worthy of our history, that we have not been carried away by the rivers of the West or the East, that we shall let ourselves be carried by our own rivers, the Serbian and Montenegrin, that we stand responsible before the future generations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also speaks of the Serbian nation and of its historical tragedies, of the enormous number of Serbian refugees inside Serbia, of the need to help &quot;Serb brothers&quot; in the Bosnian Serb republic, but with the clear acknowledgment that they live in a different state, in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he says bluntly, &quot;Those who think that Serbia cannot exist as a nation without Kosovo are wrong.&quot; Kosovo, like Jerusalem, he said, &quot;is one of those problems without a solution, that must be managed,&quot; even if it goes against &quot;the American view that every problem can be solved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reporter for the magazine Vreme, Nenad Stefanovic, said Mr. Kostunica supported the Bosnian Serbs in the 1992-95 Bosnian war and -- like many Serbs -- backed their right to secede from a Bosnia governed by Muslims and Croats. However, Mr. Kostunica rejected the brutal expulsion and slaying of non-Serbs and never supported paramilitary troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a nationalist concerned for the fate of his nation, but never against other nations,&quot; Mr. Stefanovic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A July 1998 photo of Mr. Kostunica awkwardly carrying a Kalashnikov, taken in Zubin Potok, in northern Kosovo, and published in the Belgrade daily Blic at the time, surfaced again during the election campaign. It was reprinted again this week by the Kosovo Albanian newspaper Koha Ditore. Mr. Kostunica said he went to the village, a stronghold of his party, where Serbs had formed a village watch committee to guard against attacks by the Kosovo Liberation Army, the Albanian rebel group that at the time was battling Serbian security forces. Someone handed him the gun, he said, and he was unaware of the photographer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of his allies now in the democratic opposition regarded Mr. Kostunica as a strange mixture of constitutional legalist, democrat and &quot;urban fascist&quot; for his fervent talk of Serbian national interests. Even now, the leader of his campaign, Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party, regards Mr. Kostunica's politics as traditionalist and even primitive, but without the murderous and malign nationalism manipulated by those, like Mr. Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman, the late Croatian leader, who led Yugoslavia into disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kostunica, Mr. Djindjic said, &quot;is a necessary bridge&quot; between the politics of the past and a more modern European future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Mr. Kostunica is a strong advocate of the rule of law, of an independent judiciary, of a free press and university, and of constitutional agreements binding states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he hoped to lead Serbia and Yugoslavia into a new relationship with the world, a policy different from other former Communist states. Their first transitional leaders, he said, all former party apparatchiks, &quot;were ready to accommodate to everything asked for from abroad, especially from over the ocean, despite their own political beliefs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those he criticizes for accommodation are Montenegro's president, Milo Djukanovic, the Bosnian Serb acting prime minister, Milorad Dodik, and Croatia's new president, Stjepan Mesic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia last year, he said, &quot;I've realized that my views can be a normal, authentic policy that suits most of the people in Serbia&quot; and not just the democratic opposition, from which he keeps a certain distance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And suddenly I find this new policy of mine is respected abroad,&quot; he said this week, grinning -- &quot;by Europeans more, the Americans less, but even there with some understanding.&quot;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic, a maverick critic of President Slobodan Milosevic who this week called for the use of armed U.N. peacekeepers in Kosovo, was fired today, exposing a rift in the government as the NATO bombing campaign entered its sixth week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic pulled three other members of his Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> out of the Serb-controlled government. Although his participation in policymaking was marginal, the split destroys an image of political unity cultivated by Milosevic in the face of the NATO bombardment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in a sign that NATO's targeting of refineries and fuel dumps is affecting civilian life here, the government today cut the gasoline ration further. Belgrade media said the monthly civilian allotment -- instituted when the bombing started March 24 -- was reduced from about 10 gallons per car to about five.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the Yugoslav army chief of staff said five weeks of NATO bombing had not succeeded in defeating or demoralizing his troops. &quot;I am proud to emphasize the extremely high morale of the [Yugoslav army] and the cohesive strength of our military,&quot; Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic said in remarks carried by the state news agency. &quot;I congratulate all the defenders of the fatherland, and I wish them victory as soon as possible in defending our territorial integrity, sovereignty, freedom and independence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tuesday night bombing raids, NATO warplanes struck two airfields -- in Obrva and in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo -- and a munitions storage area in Besinje, Gen. Charles Guthrie, the British chief of staff, said in London. &quot;NATO had another busy day. . . . A wide range of targets were attacked,&quot; he said. In Washington, Pentagon officials said NATO planes destroyed a Yugoslav army barracks in Prizren in southern Kosovo -- a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what appeared to be the heaviest bombing to date in Montenegro -- Serbia's small, largely alienated partner in the Yugoslav federation -- NATO aircraft pounded targets around the airport just outside the capital, Podgorica, rattling windows in the city and setting off air raid sirens. Yugoslav Army units responded with antiaircraft fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Early Thursday, state media reported continued air attacks around Podgorica and said the oil refinery in Novi Sad had been hit once again, causing a large fire that engulfed the area in dense smoke. A TV transmitter in a northern Belgrade suburb also was reported hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bulgaria, Yugoslavia's eastern neighbor, the Reuters news service reported that a bomb or missile had slammed into a house 40 miles from the Yugoslav border in a suburb of Sofia, the capital, but had caused no injuries. Bulgarian state radio said a NATO plane had entered the country's air space shortly before the blast; a NATO spokesman said he had no information on the incident.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent weeks, Draskovic had emerged as a voice of compromise within the Yugoslav leadership. On Sunday, he urged the government to make &quot;brave moves&quot; toward peace, such as agreeing to permit armed peacekeepers, including NATO troops, to police a peace settlement for Kosovo. Although Milosevic has rejected armed peacekeepers, Draskovic insisted that if the U.N. Security Council, with Russia's acquiescence, endorsed a peacekeeping mission, Yugoslavia should accept it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 52-year-old politician also accused the government of lying to the public about the war, remarks broadcast by his party's television and radio stations. On Tuesday, he launched a broadside at Milosevic, his ruling party and the Yugoslav United Left party led by Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic. Some &quot;would like this [war] situation to become a permanent state of affairs so that they could . . . pursue their partisan single-mindedness,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, in the aftermath of his ouster, Draskovic struck a conciliatory note. &quot;If there is any disagreement,&quot; he said of his dispute with Milosevic, &quot;it is only over means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firing took place without ceremony. A statement issued by the Information Ministry announced that Draskovic had been relieved of all duties in the government &quot;because of his recent public statements in contradiction with the positions of the federal government.&quot; Draskovic learned of the decision while listening to a news broadcast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A high-ranking government official said Draskovic had become a kind of traitor who welcomed the NATO air attacks -- which are aimed at reversing a campaign by government forces to drive Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority from their land and homes. Another official, however, said the last straw was Draskovic's accusation Tuesday that Milosevic was prolonging the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic's dismissal came on the eve of a visit here by Russia's envoy to the Balkans, former prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Chernomyrdin, who met with Milosevic here last week, has said the Yugoslav president is willing to allow armed international peacekeepers into Kosovo, one of NATO's central demands. Milosevic associates have denied the assertion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We accept an international civilian and non-armed mission under United Nations protection and are prepared to adapt our forces to peaceful conditions,&quot; Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spokesman Nebojsa Vujovic said today. &quot;Before that, the NATO forces located on our borders should be withdrawn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Draskovic, once a bitter political opponent of Milosevic, was brought into the government in January. Of the Belgrade-based opposition, he has the largest following, with the power to bring sympathizers into the streets. In the winter of 1996-1997, he helped organized large </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> street protests that forced the government to validate opposition gains in a municipal election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO and U.S. officials said Draskovic's dismissal is evidence of growing rifts in the Yugoslav government. &quot;It's clear that President Milosevic is isolated even within his own regime,&quot; National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said in Washington. &quot;It's clear that even his own top leadership believes he has to . . . comply with the demands of the international community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic met with Ibrahim Rugova, a pacifist Kosovo Albanian leader who has been under what authorities say is police protection in Pristina. Rugova has met with Milosevic at least once since the NATO airstrikes began, but ethnic Albanians claim he is operating under duress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rugova and Milutinovic signed a letter committing themselves to talks among all ethnic minorities in Kosovo as part of a move to reinstitute political autonomy in the province. Foreign delegates would be welcome at the talks as &quot;guests&quot; -- apparently ruling out a mediating role by Europeans or Americans. A multi-ethnic administration would be set up in Kosovo in the meantime, according to the letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff writers Dana Priest in Washington and William Booth in Podgorica contributed to this report. Vuk Draskovic was fired as Yugoslav deputy premier, exposing a rift in the government.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hard to explain, but the Serbs are a funny people, with a sense of humor dark and illuminating. Jokes here are a self-inflicted wound. This probably does not come across on CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this deeply dysfunctional society, at this exact moment, a prankster like Bogoljub Arsenijevic can be a dangerous animal. Because he wants out of the cage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known to everyone here by his nickname in this neat little city by a river, &quot;Maki&quot; is a graying former hard rocker with a fondness for Deep Purple licks. He has a fifth-grade education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is also an avant-garde performance artist in highly politicized plays, as well as a painter of large frescoes for 14 Serbian Orthodox churches, murals alive with ecstatic religious imagery. He describes himself as a religious man. He is not much to look at, a 44-year-old grandfather with long frizzy hair, aged in that way that men and women in the Balkans age, from the smoke and drink, the sausage and bread. He has had five children by four different women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the last decade, Maki has been waging a one-man campaign in Valjevo against the regime of President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years ago, when the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was cracking apart, in Slovenia, Macedonia, Croatia and Bosnia, he and his neighbors declared their own independent republic. They elected ministers and held press conferences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also erected in the courtyard of his worker's colony, a block of dreary communist-era apartments near a tool and munitions factory, an edifice of molded plaster. It was, as Maki describes it with some delicacy, &quot;a very lifelike image of the human male organ.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was eight feet tall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dedicated it to the president of Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mocking authoritarian regimes is always problematic. His sculpture wasn't subtle, but it was daring. Maki thought it was funny, but the authorities did not get the joke. A busload of riot police were dispatched to dismantle the object with a vengeance, and Maki was arrested. He served four months in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this was only a prelude to his latest act of defiance. Frustrated with the slowness of change and the failure of ordinary, cowed people to do something--anything--he and a circle of friends and allies formed the Civic Resistance of Valjevo. They plastered the city with posters announcing a rally for change in the town square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, more than 4,000 people showed up. Branko Antonic, news editor of a local independent radio station, said it was the largest gathering ever seen in the town. There have been similar, smaller demonstrations, every night this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was remarkable about the demonstration is that until now, most of the opposition to the Milosevic regime has come from political parties and their leaders. Maki and his friends reject all that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thought we should hold a civilian rally. For people. By people. We see the opposition parties as incompetent and we wanted to do something more serious.&quot; This is Kristina Peric talking. She is young and intense and is found, after several phone calls, in a small garret in the old quarter of the city. She is now leading the daily rallies. Thirteen of her comrades were arrested and Maki went into hiding. Peric describes Maki as the most courageous person she has ever met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night of the first rally, Maki stood before the crowd--beside graffiti that read, in English, &quot;Only God can judge us.&quot; He demanded that Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic, leader of a sister party to her husband's socialists, be arrested and face trial in Yugoslavia--not at The Hague, where Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal. Maki also attacked the traditional opposition here, which does nothing, he said, &quot;but organize rallies and marches and petitions, nothing that can really endanger the survival of the dictator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so hundreds of people stormed the city hall. The idea was to seize the local government offices, controlled by duly elected members of Milosevic's Socialist Party, and then to call for citizens in other cities to do the same. Their intention was clear: They wanted to spark a revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the melee that followed, several police were injured. Windows were smashed. The crowd was dispersed with batons. Maki disappeared the next morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the next few days, Maki would pass along to Peric &quot;communiques,&quot; which were read aloud to the dwindling crowds that keep appearing at the town square each night in Valjevo. On Thursday evening, a few hundred people gathered and listened to Peric read aloud from the state-run newspaper Politika. The people listened and laughed, as if they were getting a joke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state-run media in Belgrade have labeled Maki a drug addict, an unemployed bum, a criminal and troublemaker. He confesses to only the last charge. Sitting at an outdoor restaurant in Valjevo, my cellular phone rang. It was Maki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I apologize I cannot meet with you at present,&quot; he said. &quot;But I am out of town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was, in fact, in Bosnia. When would he return to Valjevo? Very soon. Would he reappear in public? Yes, when a crowd of thousands could be assembled to protect him from the police. If arrested, he said, he faces 10 years in prison as an enemy of the state and instigator of civil unrest. What was his message? &quot;My message is that I appeal to the world to understand us and to help us in any way. This is the moment we have been waiting for. If we didn't believe in ourselves and this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> we would have nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then he hung up.  Bogoljub Arsenijevic greets </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrators. Protesters in Valjevo, Yugoslavia, try to storm city hall to demand the resignation of President Slobodan Milosevic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of Oct. 5, Yugoslav democracy activist Milan Stevanovic led a small team of commandos to capture a strategic Belgrade radio station from forces loyal to President Slobodan Milosevic. The following day, with the help of heavily armed reinforcements, the same men took over the state customs service, regarded by many as the financial pillar of the Milosevic government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The logical next step, Stevanovic recalls thinking, was the arrest of Milosevic himself. This was a man who had been indicted for war crimes by an international tribunal and had just attempted to steal a democratic election. Stevanovic says he spent much of Oct. 6 waiting for the order. The decision rested with a crisis committee of opposition leaders that was effectively running the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order never came.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a big mistake,&quot; says Stevanovic, a Belgrade marketing executive responsible for shaping the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> propaganda message during the late summer election campaign. &quot;The population voted for a change of system, not just a change of government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yugoslavia's newly elected president, Vojislav Kostunica, strongly disagrees. The Serbian people, he says, are tired of &quot;radical&quot; solutions to the country's problems. They crave peace and stability and democratic gradualism. He acknowledges he has been labeled a procrastinator, but insists that time will prove him right. &quot;One should have patience,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month after the street uprising that forced Milosevic to recognize his Sept. 24 election defeat, Yugoslavia's democratic revolution is in a state of limbo and self-questioning. There are those who would like to push forward much faster, revealing the &quot;crimes&quot; of the Milosevic era immediately for all to see. And there are those--led by Kostunica--who reject the whole idea of revolutionary upheaval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, groups in the ruling coalition have formed informal alliances with rival wings of the police and armed forces, some of which were implicated in war crimes during Yugoslavia's decade of ethnic conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is a confused political situation in which power is effectively shared among Kostunica, his frequently squabbling coalition allies and erstwhile Milosevic supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there are plenty of that last group. The commander of the Yugoslav army is a former Milosevic associate, as are the newly appointed Yugoslav prime minister, the president of Serbia and the head of the Serbian secret police. (The republics of Serbia and Montenegro are all that is left of the rump Yugoslav federation, following the secession in the early 1990s of Slovenia, Bosnia, Croatia and Macedonia.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next step in this multistage revolution is set for Dec. 23, when parliamentary elections are scheduled in Serbia. The political parties, all 18 of them, that backed Kostunica for Yugoslav president say they will campaign in the Serbian election as a united coalition under the banner of DOS, which stands for Democratic Opposition of Serbia. But few expect DOS to survive intact for very long after the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We disagree on everything with the exception of two key points,&quot; said a DOS strategist, who asked to remain anonymous. &quot;One, Milosevic had to go. And two, in order to fully rid ourselves of Milosevic and his remaining supporters, DOS has to stay together, at least through the Serbian elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ideological spectrum within DOS ranges from the conservative Serbian nationalism of Kostunica to the liberal, pro-Western views of the party headed by Zoran Djindjic. Djindjic's party has the strongest organizational base, with hundreds of branches around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kostunica is way ahead of Djindjic in the opinion polls, with a current approval rating of more than 80 percent. During the Yugoslav presidential campaign in September, Djindjic recognized that Kostunica had the best chance of defeating Milosevic and agreed to serve as the DOS campaign manager. But tensions between the two men persist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strongest disagreements within DOS have concerned the security services, and particularly the Serbian secret police, which continues to be led by a Milosevic appointee, Rade Markovic. Djindjic supporters have accused Markovic of being behind a string of murders and kidnappings, including the April 1999 killing of an independent newspaper publisher, Slavko Curuvija. They allege that the secret police engaged in a wide variety of dirty tricks on behalf of Milosevic, including tapping the phones of political opponents and overseeing a huge smuggling network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica has rejected demands from Djindjic and other DOS leaders for Markovic's immediate removal from office. The president explained in an interview that he was afraid of opening &quot;a Pandora's box&quot; and preferred to wait until a new Serbian government had been formed after the Dec. 23 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need a government that will deal in a very principled way with that problem, and how to control that service,&quot; he said. &quot;To do so now [before the election] would be very unsafe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts said Kostunica sees Markovic as a political counterweight to pro-Djindjic elements in the security forces. Such people include General Mihajlo Ulemek, commander of the Special Operations Unit, alleged by Western human rights groups to have committed atrocities in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo. Ulemek himself is better known by his assumed wartime name, Legija, or Legion, which he acquired as a result of service in the French Foreign Legion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to several sources, Ulemek approached Djindjic in the days leading up to the Oct. 5 street demonstrations that finally toppled Milosevic. He promised that he would not allow his troops to be used to break up the street protests, and would oppose any move by the army to crush the demonstrations. Djindjic aides now speak admiringly of Ulemek and his Red Berets as people who can still perform a valuable service to the Yugoslav state and need to be &quot;protected&quot; from retaliation by Markovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ability of people like Markovic and Ulemek to survive Milosevic's overthrow and find new patrons in DOS is a bad sign, said Sead Spahovic, a co-minister of justice of Serbia who was nominated by the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which refused to join DOS. &quot;Markovic symbolizes the essence of what is left of the Milosevic regime,&quot; he said. &quot;As long as people like him are around, we are not going to solve the mysteries of the past few years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Kostunica and his camp contend that the events of Oct. 5-6 set in motion democratic change that is irreversible. Already, in cities and towns all over Serbia, workers and pro-democracy activists are ousting Milosevic allies from their positions. Truth commissions are being formed to investigate the corruption and skulduggery of the Milosevic years, a process that could end with the arrest and trial of Milosevic himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the pessimistic view is that the old order, even without Milosevic at its head, could adapt itself to the new, and undermine Serbia's new democracy. In an interview last week with the Belgrade weekly Vreme, Djindjic compared the Milosevic government to a hydra-headed monster that has been shattered into dozens of component parts, each of which is capable of functioning autonomously, without direction from above.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The south of Serbia is known for plum brandy and gracious monasteries but scarcely for places like the Zulu Cafe in the small town of Vladicin Han, where the decor features African statuary and a favorite number is Lou Reed's &quot;Perfect Day.&quot; The sultry song wafts over this sleepy place, as unlikely as a rainbow, and abruptly everything does seem perfect enough: the sun is shining, the well-known police informer in the corner is showing scant interest in a stranger and Slobodan Milosevic is history, ousted in Europe's last democratic revolution. It is possible to taste freedom, just as it is possible to taste murder, and this Serbian air no longer acrid with blood is little short of intoxicating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davorin Popovic, 20, savors the light air laced with Reed's voice as he sips a grainy coffee. This establishment opened in June. At the time, before Serbia's October Revolution, a small-town bar with an African name was tantamount to sedition. Davorin compares his childhood here under Milosevic's 13-year rule to that of a &quot;hostage&quot;; he talks of building Serbian democracy &quot;from the roots up&quot;; he exudes a fresh-faced determination that seems almost miraculous in a country so warped by war, so lulled by lies. But I am interested less in the dreams of this young revolutionary than in his fresh scars. For they tell the hard stories of how power really changed hands in this country and of what a necessarily scarred Serbian future holds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have traveled southward from Belgrade, over bridges now repaired after NATO's 1999 bombing, because it was not the capital that toppled Milosevic, for all the stirring images of the federal Parliament in flames on Oct. 5. Rather, his overthrow came through a provincial uprising stirred in large measure by Serbian youth acting through a grass-roots </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called Otpor (&quot;Resistance&quot;). The provinces and the young turned on Milosevic with a venom that the dithering, protest-by-news-conference political dilettantes of the capital could never muster. And nowhere did popular anger arise more suddenly than in Vladicin Han.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many years, the town of 9,000 was a typical bastion of the regime. Its setting in a fertile valley of fruit trees is seductive, but little of the charm has rubbed off on the dismal collection of buildings bisected by a railroad track. Here, the apparatchiks of Milosevic's Socialist Party instructed people how to vote if they wanted to keep their jobs in the timber and paper and fruit-juice factories. Serbian television used its monopoly to ram home a simple message: Milosevic or mayhem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few rose above the resulting fear to resist; those who did had to answer to Radivoje Stojimenovic, the burly chief of police. Davorin, a student of physical education, knew Stojimenovic because the top cop shopped for groceries at his father's store. Davorin also felt another connection -- his 25-year-old brother, Daniel, had joined the police in Belgrade. That sort of career choice earned families respect in Vladicin Han.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, Davorin recalls, it was doubly shocking for him when, back in early September, he felt Stojimenovic's hands tighten on his throat as the police chief threatened to strangle him. &quot;Are you a terrorist?&quot; the policeman screamed, his breath thick with alcohol. &quot;Who is your leader? Where does your money come from?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davorin felt terror and rage rising in equal measure, but recalled the message of his Otpor training. Do not respond to violence. Overcome your fear, because when fear disappears the regime loses a central pillar of its power. Remember that violence is the last sanctuary of the weak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He answered that his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had no leader, that he knew nothing of its financing and that it strived only for a better future for Serbia. This was too much for the police chief. &quot;You should be ashamed of your betrayal of Daniel,&quot; he yelled, squeezing Davorin's neck hard enough to leave bruises before accusing him of belonging to a &quot;murderous organization for killing the Serbian people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such was the official image of Otpor during the months leading up to the Sept. 24 election in which Vojilsav Kostunica would defeat Milosevic, opening the way for the Oct. 5 uprising that at last unseated the Serbian strongman. Against the warnings of his brother and the wishes of his parents, Davorin joined the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> early this year, soon after its local branch opened in a makeshift fitness center. Founded in Belgrade on Oct. 10, 1998, by a half-dozen survivors of the inconclusive student protests of 1996, Otpor had chosen a provocative symbol of defiance: a clenched fist, black-on-white or white-on-black, that riffed off the communist imagery (red fist) dear to Milosevic and his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This uncompromising stance attracted Davorin. Like much of Serbian youth, after 13 years under Milosevic he could see no prospects for himself. No chance to travel, to earn a decent wage, to see an international rock group, to have a say in the governance of the country. Otpor, part political </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> part social club, offered hope. Joining up was a hard decision, in that it involved taming his fears, and an easy one, in that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seemed the only way out. Where once there was nowhere to go and nothing to do, now there was Otpor's headquarters and later, the Zulu. On weekends, when the fitness machines were removed, parties raged. There was the heady feeling of belonging -- to one another and to some promise, however dim, of changing the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of young Serbs -- more than 70,000 in all -- followed Davorin's path into activism. Backed by extensive financing from the United States, Otpor steadily coaxed them from the inertia and introspective desperation of the 1990's, when the most decisive act of the best and the brightest was emigration or draft evasion. Through marches and mockery, physical courage and mental agility, Otpor grew into the mass underground </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that stood at the disciplined core of the hidden revolution that really changed Serbia. No other opposition force was as unsettling to the regime or as critical to its overthrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just how unsettling became clear to Davorin and several fellow activists in the early hours of Sept. 8. Under cover of night, they were out spray-painting Otpor fists and election slogans -- Gotov Je&quot; (&quot;He's Finished&quot;) and &quot;Vreme Je&quot; (&quot;It's Time&quot;). Briefly detained by the police, they were called back the next afternoon to be photographed and fingerprinted. But a routine, if disagreeable, session abruptly veered into a traumatic ordeal when Stojimenovic and two of his police cronies lurched back drunk from a long lunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trigger was a T-shirt worn by Vladica Mircic, 22, a friend of Davorin, that proclaimed a truly terrible and terrifying thing: &quot;Promene&quot; -- Changes.&quot; What changes? the three policemen snarled, as they ripped the shirt off him. Who did he think he was? Mircic was pushed into an office where his ankles and wrists were tied before he was beaten to the brink of unconsciousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another of Davorin's colleagues, Marko Pejakovic, 20, was sporting something almost as disturbing to the police as the T-shirt: an earring. Stojimenovic yanked at it, declaring the earring to be proof that Pejakovic was &quot;a decadent Muslim and a hater of Serbs.&quot; Shades of Bosnia. A fourth Otpor activist, Aca Radic, 23, endured a mock strangulation similar to Davorin's. All of them were threatened with &quot;liquidation&quot; on the nearby Kosovo border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a small town, the disappearance for several hours of six youths will not long go unnoticed. By late evening, about 300 people had gathered outside the police headquarters. Davorin's father, Zoran, was on the phone demanding to know what had happened. &quot;I'm glad I found out relatively late, or I might have done something I regret with my hunting rifle,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it was, by the time Zoran and Daniel Popovic reached the police station, Davorin and his friends had already been released and were at the local health clinic. When Daniel, who was on leave from his police duties in Belgrade, saw his brother's wounds, he felt &quot;disappointed and ashamed.&quot; He had not supported Davorin's joining Otpor, but neither could he tolerate such action by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His disillusionment was widely shared. Parents, relatives and friends of the students turned away from a regime that they had grudgingly supported but that had now indulged, before their eyes, in gratuitous violence against unarmed kids. In other provincial towns, similar, if usually less dramatic, incidents also moved people to a new courage, as more than 2,000 Otpor activists were detained. &quot;Nobody could ever convince me that Milosevic would go,&quot; says Davorin's mother, Dragica Popovic. &quot;But this beating changed my ideas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otpor's founding principles were straightforward, refined by the failure of earlier agitation: remove Milosevic because otherwise nothing will change; spread resistance to the provinces; galvanize a cowed population by providing examples of individual bravery; be hip, funny where possible, in order to create a contemporary message; avoid a hierarchy because the regime will co-opt any leader. &quot;The idea was, cut off one Otpor head, and another 15 heads would instantly appear,&quot; says Jovan Ratkovic, an early member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the heads were those of Slobodan Homen, who dealt with international contacts; Srdja Popovic (no relation to Davorin and Daniel), who managed &quot;human resources&quot;; Ivan Andric, who took charge of slogans and &quot;marketing&quot;; and Pedrag Lecic, who oversaw the logistics of distributing tons of material through clandestine channels. Outrage over Serbian war crimes in Bosnia or Kosovo had little to do with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but the fierce frustration of an Internet generation condemned under Milosevic to the status of international pariah had a lot to do with it. &quot;We wanted to be normal,&quot; Homen says, &quot;to be able to raise our own children here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the start, Otpor's leaders shunned violence because they believed guerrilla tactics would play to Milosevic's strengths. But they were less sure how to attack his weaknesses. It was not long, however, before they found a host of willing -- and well-financed -- instructors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American assistance to Otpor and the 18 parties that ultimately ousted Milosevic is still a highly sensitive subject. But Paul B. McCarthy, an official with the Washington-based National Endowment for Democracy, is ready to divulge some details. McCarthy sits in Belgrade's central Moskva Hotel, enjoying the satisfaction of being in a country that had long been off limits to him under Milosevic. When he and his colleagues first heard of Otpor, he says, &quot;the Fascistic look of that flag with the fist scared some of us.&quot; But these feelings quickly changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those Americans intent on bringing democracy to Serbia, the student </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> offered several attractions. Its flat organization would frustrate the regime's attempts to pick a target to hit or compromise; its commitment to enduring arrests and even police violence tended to shame the long-squabbling Serbian opposition parties into uniting; it looked more effective in breaking fear than any other group; it had a clear agenda of ousting Milosevic and making Serbia a &quot;normal&quot; European state; and it had the means to sway parents while getting out the critical vote of young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And so,&quot; McCarthy says, &quot;from August 1999 the dollars started to flow to Otpor pretty significantly.&quot; Of the almost $3 million spent by his group in Serbia since September 1998, he says, &quot;Otpor was certainly the largest recipient.&quot; The money went into Otpor accounts outside Serbia. At the same time, McCarthy held a series of meetings with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders in Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, and in Szeged and Budapest in Hungary. Homen, at 28 one of Otpor's senior members, was one of McCarthy's interlocutors. &quot;We had a lot of financial help from Western nongovernmental organizations,&quot; Homen says. &quot;And also some Western governmental organizations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a June meeting in Berlin, Homen heard Albright say, &quot;We want to see Milosevic out of power, out of Serbia and in The Hague,&quot; the site of the international war crimes tribunal. The Otpor leader would also meet with William D. Montgomery, the former American ambassador to Croatia, in the American Embassy in Budapest. (Washington had by then severed diplomatic relations with Belgrade.) &quot;Milosevic was personal for Madeleine Albright, a very high priority,&quot; says Montgomery, who was yanked out of Croatia in June to head a group of officials monitoring Serbia. &quot;She wanted him gone, and Otpor was ready to stand up to the regime with a vigor and in a way that others were not. Seldom has so much fire, energy, enthusiasm, money -- everything -- gone into anything as into Serbia in the months before Milosevic went.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just how much money backed this objective is not clear. The United States Agency for International Development says that $25 million was appropriated just this year. Several hundred thousand dollars were given directly to Otpor for &quot;demonstration-support material, like T-shirts and stickers,&quot; says Donald L. Pressley, the assistant administrator. Otpor leaders intimate they also received a lot of covert aid -- a subject on which there is no comment in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the International Republican Institute, another nongovernmental Washington group financed partly by A.I.D., an official named Daniel Calingaert says he met Otpor leaders &quot;7 to 10 times&quot; in Hungary and Montenegro, beginning in October 1999. Some of the $1.8 million the institute spent in Serbia in the last year was &quot;provided direct to Otpor,&quot; he says. By this fall, Otpor was no ramshackle students' group; it was a well-oiled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> backed by several million dollars from the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other American help was as important as money. Calingaert's organization arranged for a seminar at the luxurious Budapest Hilton from March 31 to April 3. There a retired United States Army colonel, Robert Helvey, instructed more than 20 Otpor leaders in techniques of nonviolent resistance. This session appears to have been significant. It also suggests a link between the American-influenced opposition base in Budapest and the events in Vladicin Han.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Aca Radic, one of the students tortured in Vladicin Han, who founded the Otpor branch there. His motives were similar to Davorin Popovic's. &quot;I just felt, enough of tolerance,&quot; he says. &quot;Enough of patience.&quot; So this good-looking young man -- like Davorin, a student of physical education -- made his way up to Belgrade in December 1999. At the Otpor office there, he was closely questioned and then given flyers, leaflets, sprays, posters, Otpor T-shirts and $130 and a cell phone. &quot;I was happy,&quot; Radic said, &quot;I felt like a revolutionary going home to spread the word.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man who gave him this insurrectionary material was Srdja Popovic. Lean and trenchant, Srdja calls himself -- half jokingly -- the &quot;ideological commissar&quot; of Otpor. He combines a Leninist intensity with the skills of a Washington lobbyist. (His favorite word is &quot;networking.&quot;) It was he who coordinated the training of Otpor's 70,000 members in 130 branches, including the one that opened in Vladicin Han.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These training methods were heavily influenced by Helvey. Gathered in a conference room of the Budapest Hilton (&quot;We thought it was stupid to organize a revolution in a luxury hotel,&quot; Srdja says, &quot;but the Americans chose that place&quot;), the Otpor activists listened as Helvey dissected what he called the &quot;pillars of support&quot; of the regime. These naturally included the police, the army and the news media, but also the more intangible force of Milosevic's &quot;authority.&quot; That is, his capacity to give orders and be obeyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Find nonviolent ways to undermine authority, Helvey suggested. Look at Myanmar. There, the opposition National League for Democracy took a farmer's hat as its symbol; so everyone started to wear farmer's hats. The regime tried to make the hats illegal, but such repression merely provoked outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same thing would happen in Serbia with Otpor's T-shirts adorned with the fist symbol. &quot;We focused on breaking Milosevic's authority, on ways to communicate to dissatisfied people that they are the majority and that the regime could only dig itself into a deeper hole through repression,&quot; Srdja recalls. &quot;We learned that fear is a powerful but vulnerable weapon because it disappears far faster than you can recreate it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helvey stressed the sources of momentum in a nonviolent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is an enormous price -- domestic and international -- paid today for using force against a nonviolent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; he says. &quot;The battle is asymmetrical. The dictator still may hold the externalities of power, but he is steadily undermined.&quot; This process has been dubbed &quot;political ju-jitsu&quot; by Gene Sharp, an American writer who is close to Helvey and who emerged as a sort of guru to Otpor leaders. His book &quot;From Dictatorship to Democracy: A Conceptual Framework for Liberation,&quot; became a samizdat passed around Otpor branches in the last months of Milosevic's rule. In it, Sharp writes, &quot;The stark brutality of the regime against the clearly nonviolent actionists politically rebounds against the dictators' position, causing dissension in their own ranks as well as fomenting support for the resisters among the general population, the regime's usual supporters and third parties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Srdja is often to be found in Belgrade with heavily underlined copies of Sharp's work, parts of which were translated into Serbian as the &quot;Otpor User Manual.&quot; Not for nothing were Otpor's activities drawn from Sharp's list of 198 &quot;methods of nonviolent action.&quot; In an interview, Sharp says: &quot;My key principle is not ethical. It has nothing to do with pacifism. It is based on an analysis of power in a dictatorship and how to break it by withdrawing the obedience of citizens and the key institutions of society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Srdja, Otpor simply represents the &quot;ideology of nonviolent individual resistance.&quot; It was developed, he says, &quot;because we finally understood that nobody from Mars was going to come and remove Milosevic.&quot; Organization was intense. Throughout Serbia, activists were trained in how to play hide-and-seek with the police, how to respond to interrogation, how to develop a message in posters and pamphleteering, how to transfer fear from the population into the regime itself and how to identify and begin to infiltrate Helvey's &quot;pillars of support&quot; in the police and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just how effective that infiltration was became clear to Srdja 12 days before Milosevic's July 27 call for a presidential election. Otpor received advance word of Milosevic's intentions in secret e-mailed messages from anonymous dissenters within the regime. As a result, Otpor already had more than 60 tons of electoral propaganda ready on July 27. Some of it went to Vladicin Han, where Aca Radic and his friends went out every night to plaster slogans. When he was arrested and beaten seven weeks later, Radic had a last message to communicate to the police: &quot;I was silent as they beat me, determined not to react, trying to look Stojimenovic in the eye to show him I was not afraid and convey one thing: You can hit us and beat us, but our time will come as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From his position as deputy commander of the police in a central Belgrade neighborhood, Daniel Popovic was well placed to observe the growing unease provoked by Otpor. Daniel is a calm young man, reflective and ponderous where his brother, Davorin, is brisk and agitated. Daniel's manner is less intense than his brother's, his features softer, his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> slower. He is of conservative disposition, more inclined to value order than change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel says he became a policeman &quot;because I like justice and have a very strong sense of injustice.&quot; In 1994, he moved to the capital from Vladicin Han to begin his studies at the police academy, qualifying five years later. Married to a half-Croatian woman named Milena, he has a 1-year-old daughter, Anastasia, whom he clearly adores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But life has scarcely been playful over the past couple of years. Daniel was almost dispatched to Kosovo during the NATO war; he lost several young colleagues there. Then, early this year, he started hearing about Otpor, described within the police as an enemy of the state and a stooge of Madeleine Albright. As the Otpor alarm began to sound, he received disturbing news: his brother, Davorin, had joined the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the time, I told him I could not support him, but would not condemn him,&quot; Daniel recalls. But on May 13, things changed. The governor of the northern province of Novi Sad, a senior member of Milosevic's party, was assassinated by a deranged gunman. The regime, with no evidence, accused Otpor of the killing, calling it a &quot;terrorist organization&quot; for the first time. Daniel received instructions that Otpor activists were to be treated as &quot;terrorists.&quot; Anyone detained was to be interrogated, photographed and fingerprinted -- a procedure he knew to be illegal. Still, he had to follow instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After some hesitation, the young policeman decided to alert his activist brother. &quot;I told him what the situation was,&quot; Daniel says. &quot;I told him that a file would be opened on him if he was arrested, and there was a strong possibility he might be detained. I warned him things were getting unpleasant.&quot; The response surprised Daniel. &quot;Davorin told me he was aware of the dangers, but he did not seem to care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This exchange captured, in microcosm, the shifting psychology of Serbia, a change that would lead to Europe's last democratic revolution. On the one hand, a weary young policeman, earning $65 a month, embittered by the regime's paltry reaction to the death of colleagues in Kosovo (their widows received a free vacation on the coast), unhappy that joining Milosevic's party (or that of his wife) was the only passport to high rank, troubled by an apparently disproportionate onslaught on young people like his brother. On the other, a student with nothing to lose, tired of the small-town oppression that has been his only lot, trained to understand that breaking the regime may involve absorbing its blows, convinced, as an Otpor sticker put it, that Serbia had reached a point of Sad ili Nikad -- Now or Never.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel did his duty. After May, he found himself fingerprinting dozens of Otpor activists caught doing anything from distributing matchboxes to putting up a poster. But violence was never used on them in Belgrade, he says. &quot;The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spread very quickly,&quot; he adds, &quot;and its courage caused panic in the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how did he feel as part of an institution that was a chief bulwark of the regime? It was my job, Daniel ventures. He was there to protect order, the constitution, laws. The clampdown on Otpor was an &quot;overreaction,&quot; but it &quot;came from the very top.&quot; He had to be neutral. &quot;I don't know about defending the regime,&quot; he continues, sipping a plum brandy made in his hometown. &quot;My friends and I tried to tell ourselves we did not work for one side or the other, but for the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came the beatings in Vladicin Han, a profoundly disturbing incident to Daniel. The most moving moment occurred when Davorin told his family that his beating had been accompanied by charges that he was disgracing his brother. No, Davorin insisted, the truth was otherwise: he was fighting in Otpor so that his brother and sister-in-law and 16-month-old niece might have a future, a decent police wage to live on, an apartment they could afford in a country no longer isolated. Davorin continued: &quot;We know the educated police are on our side. Only the bullies are with Milosevic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel looks at me, a sort of helpless half smile on his face, as if to say: What could I respond to that? And suddenly, all the anguish, the misery, the upheaval of the four wars of Yugoslavia's destruction, of the hundreds of thousands of dead, of the countless divided families and broken homes, wells up in this Belgrade room, and the face of Daniel's wife, Milena, cracks like parched earth, and she sobs uncontrollably. &quot;Incompetent and bad people made the Serbian people guilty, made us cursed for living in such a beautiful country, refused us a decent living and created hatred everywhere,&quot; she says. &quot;My mother is a Croat. My grandparents are Croats and live in Dubrovnik, and I have not seen them for 10 years. It was Milosevic's regime that created this hatred. They wanted Serbs against Croats, then Serbs against Bosnians, then Serbs against Kosovars -- and at last Serbs against Serbs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She looks at her husband and then adds with vehemence: &quot;But Daniel and Davorin were not going to let Serbs kill Serbs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is crying. Little Anastasia is in her father's lap. The television, for so long the vehicle of Milosevic's hate-mongering propaganda, is blaring. The decade-long tide of Balkan destruction has touched these people like everyone else, but unlike many of Milosevic's victims, they are at least alive. Milena tries to control her tears. Her mother works in the southern town of Vranje, near Vladicin Han, for one of the wealthiest members of the kleptocracy installed by Milosevic, a man named Dragan Tomic, who runs a furniture conglomerate called Simpo. He's a thief and a criminal, Milena says; he threatens; he intimidates; he bestrides the place. Her mother earns $28 a month in a Simpo canteen, and, Milena says, &quot;she was told to vote for Milosevic or be fired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was similar pressure among the police. But Daniel and his wife, like a large number of police families, did not vote as instructed. Votes, however, were never going to be sufficient to topple Milosevic, and he began, as ever, to maneuver to divide the opposition. Kostunica did not have the required 50 percent of the vote (in fact, he had at least 52 percent); a second round of voting would be needed, perhaps even a whole new election because of fraud. Otpor's response, like the rest of the opposition, was to take to the streets. And as the climactic demonstration of Oct. 5 loomed, Daniel faced an alarming prospect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought a lot about what might happen if I confronted Davorin,&quot; he says. &quot;I could not be sure that I would not confront him in the crowd, or, perhaps worse, that policemen who did not know he was my brother would confront him. I was very worried. There were strange things happening. Very few police were being readied compared to those available. There were no water cannons, no helicopters. It seemed that either it was a preparation for a surrender or a preparation of a scenario in which a defenseless policeman would get shot and provide an excuse for Milosevic to bring in the army.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dragica Popovic, the mother of Daniel and Davorin, is trembling. After Davorin's beating, she could not sleep. She was afraid the phone was tapped. Sometimes the phone would ring inexplicably in the middle of the night. She and her husband, Zoran, wanted to disconnect it. But what if Daniel needed to call them from Belgrade? &quot;Fear crept completely inside us,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They had warned Davorin, even before the beating, to desist. They knew Otpor would bring him problems. The regime was &quot;in each and every pore.&quot; At her timber factory, the pressure to back Milosevic was unrelenting. She told her younger son to be quiet, to stay out of politics, because nothing good would come of any election. But he shot back, &quot;Yes, you're afraid you'll lose your job, and Dad is afraid he'll lose his store, and Daniel's in the police, but somebody has to start with something!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, Dragica and Zoran had voted for Milosevic. It was not that they were happy with the situation. But they had a son in the police. &quot;It was a kind of psychosis,&quot; Dragica says. &quot;If Milosevic goes, everything will fall apart. Somebody will bomb us, the Kosovo Albanians will take our land, all hell will break loose. So we voted to keep him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All hell broke loose anyway: the Kosovo war and NATO bombs that sent whole dinners -- including one memorable chicken -- flying off their table; the loss of Kosovo, the very province whose fate Milosevic had used back in 1987 to propel himself to power as the messiah of a Greater Serbia; friends of Daniel killed; salaries falling; Albanians rising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Dragica and Zoran thought they would vote for Milosevic again -- until they saw what happened to their son in the local police station and turned to Kostunica. But with scant hope. &quot;I thought Milosevic would win, and we'd have to leave Vladicin Han,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the vote, more confusion. And mounting fear. On Oct. 5, the day of the huge demonstration that turned into a revolution, hundreds of people left Vladicin Han in cars and buses for the capital. Dragica did not know where her sons were. &quot;That was the most agonizing day,&quot; she says. &quot;The Parliament was burning, and I thought Daniel was there, and I was not sure where Davorin was, and we just could not get more crazy than that day. It was like splitting in two; I did not know who to worry about more. One in the police, one against the police. And I felt my brain would break apart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She can hold back the tears no longer. This middle-aged woman, so determined to salvage the vestiges of her dignity, is sobbing. I have seen so many rooms full of tears since I first accompanied a bus of raging Serbian nationalist volunteers into Bosnia in 1992 that I sometimes feel grief has become the very matter and substance of this corner of Europe, a sort of Balkan anti-oxygen that millions of people have been forced to breathe. Once again, the cause of the tears is division. In this case, of two boys. In others I have known, of husband and wife, of brother and sister, of Serb and Muslim, of Serb and Albanian, of the living and the dead. Dragica Popovic does not know it, but the Balkan shipwreck overseen by Milosevic has left her relatively unscathed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She need not have worried. Early in the morning of Oct. 5, Daniel Popovic received a call ordering him and his police unit out of Belgrade to the Kolubara mine complex, 30 miles south of the capital, where thousands of workers had called a strike that had been critical in weakening Milosevic. This odd order amounted to another signal that the regime was crumbling from within as well as from without. For why, Daniel wondered, should the police be ordered to leave the capital when hundreds of thousands of protesters were converging on it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Kolubara, where the police had already shown they were not ready to use force to break the strike, Daniel spent the day chatting amiably with workers and drinking coffee. Meanwhile, no more than a few hundred policemen confronted the demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now clear that important elements of the police and the army, as disillusioned as Daniel Popovic, had been won over to the opposition side before the federal Parliament went up in smoke and Milosevic decided to quit, ostensibly, he said, &quot;to spend more time with my grandson.&quot; The Otpor manual of Gene Sharp had been emphatic on this point: &quot;Defiance strategists should remember that it will be exceptionally difficult, or impossible, to disintegrate the dictatorship if the police, bureaucrats and military forces remain fully supportive of the dictatorship and obedient in carrying out its commands. Strategies aimed at subverting the loyalty of the dictators' forces should therefore be given a high priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were, says Zoran Zivkovic, the mayor of the southern city of Nis and a close ally of Otpor. &quot;We had secret talks with the army and police, the units we knew would be drafted to intervene,&quot; he confides. &quot;And the deal was that they would not disobey, but neither would they execute. If they had said no, other units would have been brought in. So they said yes when Milosevic asked for action -- and they did nothing.&quot; It was this impassivity that allowed Zivkovic and other regional mayors, particularly Velimir Ilic of Cacak, to bring in the tough men from the provinces that got the job done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the last, leading members of the regime, like Dragoljub Milanovic, the head of the hated Serbian television (or &quot;TV Bastille&quot;), and his news editor, Milorad Komrakov, believed that the army would save them. They had been promised military vehicles to escort them from the building. But the army never came. To save his skin, Komrakov was forced to go on camera and make a snivelling plea to Milosevic: &quot;I am begging you, for the sake of the honor of the Serbian people, to recognize the victory of the people, so we can live normally like the rest of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Normality -- the long-held dream of Otpor. In the end, Davorin was far from his brother, Daniel, and far from danger, on the day Serbia rose. He was in Nis, working with Otpor activists there. Others from Otpor's Vladicin Han branch, including its founder, Radic, were in Belgrade meeting scant police resistance as they stormed the Parliament. Zoran Popovic, the boys' father, says now: &quot;The kids should have been born earlier to make these changes.&quot; And what if they had found themselves on the barricades, Daniel on one side, Davorin on the other, with Serbia's fate between them? &quot;Of course,&quot; says Daniel, &quot;I would have put my arms around my brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There he sits, Radivoje Stojimenovic, the police chief of Vladicin Han, the man who left bruises on Davorin Popovic's neck and directed a drunken orgy of kicking and beating against the young Otpor activists. He has survived the revolution. Dressed in a gray suit that is a little too tight for him, he greets me with a very firm handshake. Beside him are two phones and a fax machine. On a table in a corner is a computer keyboard but no sign of a computer. Behind him are a couple of withering plants and shelves full of trophies won, he explains, for marksmanship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, he says, twiddling his thumbs, he would like to be courteous to a visitor from as far away as New York, but he cannot say much without authorization from the Interior Ministry. I should understand, he suggests, that it is much harder to be a policeman in a small town than in Belgrade. People react emotionally. They all know one another. That makes things difficult. &quot;But we are professionals and do everything by the book. The problem is, things get politicized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stojimenovic adjusts his watch and for no apparent reason moves some scissors on the desk in front of him. His eyes are somber, small, shrewd. He offers some coffee. There is talk of the weather and the NATO bombing (&quot;That's high politics, too much for us ordinary mortals,&quot; he opines), and then I put the question: &quot;What was the reason for the beating of the six kids from Otpor on Sept. 8?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silence. He looks a little uncomfortable, then gathers himself. &quot;It did not happen,&quot; he says. I look him in the eye, where I find only a sort of blankness, and try another approach. &quot;You mean the accounts of the beatings have been exaggerated?&quot; He thinks about that. &quot;No,&quot; he repeats finally. &quot;They did not happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I shudder inwardly. Suddenly I am in another Balkan place with another small-town Serbian official who was busy reinventing the past. That man's name was Mihajlo Bajagic, and, at the time in 1994, he was mayor of an ethnically cleansed Bosnian town called Vlasenica, where more than 18,000 Muslims had lived. The Muslims were gone, most of them driven out, many of them slaughtered by the Serbs in a local camp called Susica, and I was asking Bajagic what had happened to them. The answer I received was that they had &quot;simply run away of their own accord.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it becomes clear to me, looking at the impassive Stojimenovic, remembering Bajagic, that this is what Davorin and Aca Radic and Srdja Popovic and Slobodan Homen and all the bold young men and women behind Serbia's strangely bloodless revolution will have to come to terms with: the lies, the distortions, the reinventions, the holes in time, the frenetic scrambling of turncoats that are the legacy of the darkest period of Serbia's history. It was a decade or more in which the Serb as eternal victim was incapable of seeing that this time around the Serb was more often the perpetrator of terrible crimes. These are the scars the coming generation will carry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They do not want to see them now; they are busy with other things. Like the &quot;future&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;Europe.&quot; But this revolution, imprinted to the end with Otpor's nonviolent ethos, has stopped at a sort of halfway house where shadows lurk: Milosevic is alive and in Serbia; Stojimenovic and thousands like him are still in their jobs; the new government still has a blacklist of journalists, including such distinguished American correspondents as Roy Gutman and Christiane Amanpour, accused of &quot;satanizing&quot; Serbia, whatever that means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My conscience is clear,&quot; Stojimenovic announces to me as he bids me farewell. &quot;The ministry will clarify everything. We in the police are at the service of the state. I have no intention of resigning. I am a professional, and this is my job. We will see what the future brings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Serbian future, in many respects, lies with Otpor. &quot;We hope the new generation of leaders will come from Otpor's ranks,&quot; says Montgomery, the Budapest-based American diplomat, who is set to move to Belgrade as ambassador when diplomatic relations are restored. That would be a fair return on America's investment in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is a reasonable bet that things are about to get complicated for Otpor. Zivkovic, the mayor of Nis, who is now also Interior Minister in the Kostunica government, calls Otpor &quot;the best political project in Serbia since the state's creation.&quot; But, he adds, if the integrity of its achievement is to be preserved, Otpor should disband itself immediately. Its job is done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, say many Otpor members. The first part of Otpor's mission is accomplished: Milosevic is gone. But the second, far more ambitious goal of making Serbia a &quot;normal European country&quot; persists. &quot;We want to be like everyone else: work, have jobs with value, be governed by intelligent people rather than illiterate thugs, live under the rule of law,&quot; Davorin says. He insists Otpor must persevere, not to have power itself, but &quot;to act as a watchdog of all powers.&quot; As a start, he and his friends have brought a lawsuit against Stojimenovic and his police cronies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will remain to remind Kostunica: people are watching you, man,&quot; says Srjda Popovic, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> self-styled ideological commissar. &quot;Don't forget, democracy starts here. You are responsible to the people.&quot; He rushes from meeting to meeting, cell phone in one hand, slice of pizza in another, trying to organize the future. Otpor is to have six departments: international, political, press, a research organization, human resources and a department dealing with reform of universities. &quot;We're getting organized because we don't trust the politicians to change this country,&quot; says Srjda. He's thinking big: &quot;We would like to be in the encyclopedia of nonviolent resistance with Gandhi and Martin Luther King. We have a right to dream about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But before the dreams, the reality. Tensions abound. Homen, now formally in charge of &quot;international relations,&quot; wants Otpor to be transformed into a political party. He reckons -- probably accurately -- that &quot;65 percent of what was the Serbian opposition is us.&quot; That is a considerable potential force. He yearns, he says, to live in a country &quot;where Otpor is not necessary.&quot; It is clear enough that this young man, like many of his colleagues, has political ambitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A party, however, would need a leader; many believe that would be the death knell for Otpor. Vladica Mircic, the student whose T-shirt bearing the word &quot;Changes&quot; proved so provocative in Vladicin Han, thinks a central task for Otpor now is &quot;to get rid of Serbia's cult of leaders and messiahs. Milosevic was the savior of the Serbs, and look where we are now. That is why Otpor must never become a political party. We should be a popular </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to remind leaders of the limits of their power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the debate on its future rages, Otpor is everything and nothing in the new Serbia. It is not a party; it is not even registered as a nongovernmental organization. Yet, in what is destined to become a capitalist country, it is probably Serbia's most respected brand name. As McCarthy of the National Endowment for Democracy notes, &quot;Otpor was always as much a state of mind as a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Some American officials are pressing the group to register and make its budget at least semitransparent. But the response from Otpor leaders is that the situation in Serbia is still too sensitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dilemmas, dilemmas. After the revolution, Serbia is broken: decrepit factories, twisted minds, embedded pain, corrupted institutions. There are people prepared to admit errors; there are also the myriad, malleable Serbian mythmakers who have already wrought such havoc. I gaze at all these bright young activists who emerged from a decade of deadening destruction and wonder at their earnest vitality and obstinate patriotism even as I worry that the scale of the task ahead -- not least the shattering of myths -- will either break them or simply elude them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Milosevic must be held responsible,&quot; Davorin says. &quot;We cannot forget, so that he gets to spend time with his grandson.&quot; But where to begin? Of course, Davorin says, there were crimes against &quot;others.&quot; But the most evil, he insists, was done by Milosevic to his own people. &quot;Muslims, Croats, Albanians had one war,&quot; he says, &quot;but we Serbs were in all of them. That is why we want to try Milosevic here and not in The Hague.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davorin was 12 when Milosevic went to war in Bosnia. How much can he know or should he know? But I want to tell him that he is wrong to imagine that Serbs suffered most in the wars. What he saw in that Vladicin Han police station -- the thuggery, the anti-Muslim slurs, the drunken violence -- was nothing but a mild refrain from the thunderous crescendo of butchery that filled Muslim mass graves in Bosnia and similar pits of death in Kosovo. I want to tell him that, yes, as all the young men and women of Otpor like to note, there are a lot of Serbian refugees in Serbia; but there were also millions of German refugees in Germany after World War II, and if Milosevic was emphatically not Hitler, the spasm of nationalist frenzy he unleashed was the closest thing Europe had seen in five decades to the mass murder of Nazi expansionism. Folly has its backlash. I want to express many things, including the idea that you cannot build Serbia's craved &quot;normality&quot; on a foundation of unacknowledged killing, but I am silent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were three sides in Bosnia,&quot; Davorin goes on. &quot;It's not easy to disentangle. It's a bit like the three rooms where we were beaten in the police station. There was violence in all of them. And we are still trying to collect all the information on that. Imagine how difficult it is then for Bosnia. Everyone must be held accountable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel Popovic wants some accounting done, too, like the purging of all the policemen promoted just because they joined Milosevic's party, or the ouster of Stojimenovic. Politics and the police should be separated at last. &quot;I still believe in justice, and that Anastasia has a future here in Serbia,&quot; he says. &quot;But we are fearful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To dispel this insidious fear, Srdja Popovic has an idea. Let the Serbian people rock! &quot;We need R.E.M. in Belgrade first,&quot; he says, &quot;then we can speak of Srebrenica,&quot; the small Bosnian town where 7,000 Muslims were slaughtered by Serbian forces in 1995. Srdja continues: &quot;Let's get a relaxed atmosphere, then we'll speak of the NATO bombing. Everyone here has been through a 10-year trauma and needs positive incentives. America helped us remove a dictator. Now, please, give Serbs a chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was for a chance that Davorin fought in his closed little town. &quot;We knew we had to go to the end, because it would be too late when they switched off the lights and started killing people,&quot; he says to me at the Zulu Cafe. There is life in his eyes, as powerful and undeniable as all those Balkan images from the past decade of dead limbs entwined in patterns of silent, ghostly horror. I struggle to find some appropriate balance between this life still touched with innocence and all that death still unconfronted here in Serbia, but in the end can only fall silent again and listen to that hypnotic American voice of Velvet Underground fame:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's such a perfect day, I'm glad I spent it with you. Oh, such a perfect day, you just keep me hanging on. . . . You're going to reap just what you sow. You're going to reap just what you sow. You're going to reap just what you sow. . . . &quot;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political tension and public outrage collided outside the Serbian Parliament yesterday when bodyguards protecting an ultranationalist leader fired pistols into the air to turn back a rock-throwing crowd as Yugoslavia struggled to form a government around President Vojislav Kostunica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting marked a day of political drama as Kostunica moved swiftly to consolidate his power. Government ministers loyal to former leader Slobodan Milosevic were purged and the Serbian state Parliament was on the verge of dissolving. The European Union - in a strong show of support for Kostunica - pledged $2 billion in aid and began lifting some of the economic sanctions that have paralyzed Yugoslavia for a decade.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day was also filled with confusion and consternation for thousands of government workers. With Milosevic's cronies being swept from power, government employees from customs agents to tax collectors were shifting allegiances to new political forces. Attempting to fathom the sweeping changes taking place at state-controlled Serbian TV, where she worked, secretary Roksanda Leandrov summed up the feelings of many: &quot;I feel like I'm swinging on a trapeze.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such is the mood of Yugoslavia's new democracy. The street protests and civil unrest that toppled Milosevic on Thursday have barely been comprehended. But the passion of shaping a new country is unfolding so quickly that there is little time for reflection. Each hour seems to bring new intrigue and painful choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appeared by last night that Kostunica was nearing another victory. The Serbian Parliament may vote as early as today to disband and hold new elections in December. The move would strip Milosevic of his strongest remaining power base. The Parliament - which represents Yugoslavia's largest republic - is controlled by Milosevic's Socialist party. If the Socialists lose Parliament, political analysts say, it will be much easier for Kostunica to build a strong federal coalition government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some lawmakers and government ministers were heckled as they emerged from the arduous Parliament session. A crowd of about 500 booed and threw wads of paper and rocks at Vojislav Seselj, the 6-foot-4 ultranationalist leader who controlled paramilitary gangs in Bosnia and Kosovo. Seselj, the Serbian deputy premier, is a symbol of this nation's bloody past, and he battled to protect the Parliament from demise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the crowd pressed in, Seselj's bodyguards brandished machine guns and pistols. One bodyguard fired into the air. Seselj ran down the sidewalk. The mob chased him, cursing and hurling stones. Another bodyguard fired overhead. Seselj disappeared around a corner and sped away in a car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are sick of Seselj and his obstruction,&quot; said Jovan Hadzic, one of those in the angry crowd. &quot;Seselj is a cancer of our new democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seselj is the worst crook,&quot; Miroslav Nedeljkovic said. &quot;He would sacrifice all of us just to survive. He is the personification of evil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The face-offs inside Parliament were only slightly more civil. The chamber echoed with recriminations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbian interior minister, Vlajko Stojiljkovic, a onetime ally of Milosevic's who controlled the state police, resigned in a fury after listening to criticism from lawmakers. It was the first time many Serbs had witnessed official rebukes of the Milosevic regime. Many were amused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many were disgusted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Interior Minister was using the police for Milosevic's protection and for illegal businesses,&quot; said Borivoje Borovic, a member of the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been fighting ethnic Albanian extremists and criminals,&quot; Stojiljkovic said. &quot;I'm very proud of the work the police have done . . . and now I'm being attacked by NATO-sponsored politicians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's influence on politics was further weakened by the resignation of Momir Bulatovic, Yugoslavia's prime minister. Hard-line Milosevic supporters tried to rally, but it was becoming increasingly evident that the former Yugoslav ruler, an indicted war criminal, is losing the last vestiges of his authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The disunity among the Serbs is inciting the plans of our proven [foreign] enemies,&quot; said Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, the Yugoslav defense minister. &quot;If we continue like this, we won't get far. . . . How can we save the people of Serbia? How can we prevent our extinction?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica received another boost from the European Union. The EU's foreign ministers voted to lift a number of economic sanctions, including bans on commercial flights. It also pledged $2 billion in aid. The international community, according to diplomats, is intent on rewarding Kostunica and keeping alive the Yugoslav momentum for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Yugoslav people have voted for democracy,&quot; the EU said in a statement yesterday. &quot;As a result . . . the EU has agreed on a radical revision of its policy toward Yugoslavia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the EU lifted economic sanctions, it left in effect measures that target Milosevic and his allies by freezing their assets abroad and banning them from traveling to 15 EU countries. But the EU foreign ministers remained silent on the fate of Milosevic, who is wanted for trial in the Hague for atrocities committed last year in Kosovo. The international community had indicated earlier that sanctions would not be lifted until Milosevic was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As bickering filled the Serbian Parliament, government employees began the week uneasy. In a country where the average monthly income is $40, many were worried about their jobs. Others wondered who their new bosses would be. Meanwhile, the work began on delving into the mysteries and secrets of corruption left behind by Milosevic's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The members of the old regime are trying to cover their tracks and trying to destroy all the evidence that might implicate them for all types of things - financial, political and other stuff,&quot; Milan Protic, Belgrade's new mayor, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roksanda Leandrov was worried about her job at state RTS TV, until recently Milosevic's main propaganda tool. A secretary there for 25 years, Leandrov said the station had been in a tumult since Thursday, when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrators set the headquarters on fire. The station is now in the hands of Kostunica's supporters and Milosevic loyalists at RTS are lying low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in complete confusion,&quot; said Leandrov, who sat in the smoky RTS cafe, brushing lint off her long gray skirt. &quot;We don't have things to do our work. We don't have enough technical equipment. Two of our studios have been robbed and burned. We don't know about the future. I'm really just thinking about my children.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organized opposition against President Slobodan Milosevic took to the streets of one of the Yugoslav leader's strongholds today in a protest that was interrupted by gunshots, rock-throwing and brawling as the two sides of this divided society openly clashed for the first time since the end of the war in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia had scheduled a counter-demonstration in this small city in southern Serbia--at the exact spot and time of the opposition rally--but it canceled at the last minute. That did not stop Milosevic supporters from unfurling banners that labeled the protesters &quot;traitors&quot; and worse or from pelting the opposition crowd of 4,000 with apples and eggs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the apple-throwers was chased by a number of youths into Socialist Party headquarters, where they began punching him. At that point, Ratko Zecevic, a local Socialist leader, stood on the balcony of the building and fired six gunshots into the air, spreading momentary panic. No one was seriously injured.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest rally was the latest in a series of anti-government demonstrations that have been staged around Serbia in the past 10 days calling for the resignation of Milosevic and his coterie in the aftermath of the defeat of Serb-led Yugoslav forces in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitions have been circulating in cities across Serbia and Yugoslavia demanding Milosevic's removal, a cause the opposition-led Belgrade city council is preparing to endorse. Wheat farmers too are protesting because of low prices for their crops and a shortage of diesel fuel for their machinery, saying they are being robbed by Milosevic cronies. Army reservists are blocking roads and demanding back pay. The Serbian Orthodox Church has called for Milosevic to step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, opposition leader Zoran Djindic told demonstrators here to prepare for a &quot;hot summer&quot; in which they should stop working and take to the streets in protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Milosevic and his regime do not appear to be going anywhere. Indeed, opposition leaders are not sure exactly how to bring him down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you get rid of Milosevic? We don't know,&quot; said Ognjen Pribicevic, a leader of the opposition Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's the unanswered question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pribicevic and others, including European diplomats in Belgrade, say they are not sure whether widespread demonstrations will be enough. Milosevic weathered months of protests in Belgrade in the winter of 1996-97, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest government vote-rigging in local elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea that he will be swept away in an avalanche of popular protest seems too easy to me,&quot; said one diplomat. &quot;It may be the case that things get much worse here before they get better.&quot; Some warn darkly of coming civil war, for this is a deeply divided society in which power is often a game of winner take all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's party, according to the latest credible polling here, still retains widespread, although diminished, public support. For the last 10 years, Milosevic has wisely combined patronage, Serbian nationalism and the selective use of force to hold onto power despite the loss of wars by Serbian nationalists he supported in three former Yugoslav republics and, now, Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition leaders hope that someone in Milosevic's inner circle may act to push him aside--but the Yugoslav leader is constantly pruning the ranks of his closest aides and officials, replacing them with dyed-in-the-wool loyalists. A coup would also produce general havoc and likely lead to the replacement of one strongman with another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior officials in Belgrade, capital of both Serbia and Yugoslavia, dismiss the importance of the mounting protests. &quot;The people have a right to express themselves,&quot; said Goran Matic, a minister without portfolio who is close to Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others in the leadership are not so sanguine. Ivan Markovic, a spokesman for the Yugoslav United Left--a party led by Milosevic's wife--declared on Wednesday: &quot;We will defend ourselves against the fifth columnists and moral scum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markovic charged that &quot;the CIA is financing media in Yugoslavia as well as people with Yugoslav citizenship, deserters and even men who have worn a general's uniform&quot;--a clear reference to Vuk Obradovic, a former Yugoslav army general who now is a leading member of the opposition and who spoke at today's rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstration here followed similar protests in the Serbian cities of Cacak, Novi Sad, Uzice and Leskovac. At each, more and more riot police have gathered at the edges of town, ready to wade into the crowds if they become unruly. Police also have arrested, beaten and harassed opposition party workers trying to gather signatures on petitions or pass out leaflets announcing the demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Leskovac, as many as 10,000 people turned out in recent days to protest the arrest of Ivan Novkovic, a radio station technician who interrupted a local broadcast of a Yugoslav basketball game to play a videotape of himself demanding the resignation of a local pro-Milosevic official, Zivojin Stefanovic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday night in Leskovac, crowds besieged the local police station to demand Novkovic's release from a sentence of 30 days in jail. Then they went to Stefanovic's home, where he emerged, pistol in hand, and threatened to shoot a local human rights activist. Local police disarmed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in the opposition crowd in Prokuplje today were army reservists who had fought in Kosovo. One of them, Alexander, 28, who asked that his last name not be used, spent three months fighting in Kosovo. &quot;Why am I here? These people have been in power for 50 years,&quot; he said. &quot;It doesn't matter to me who replaces them. Anybody. As long as they bring down this regime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ljubinka Ivic, an unemployed middle-aged woman, said her son was wounded in Kosovo. &quot;I want change,&quot; she said. &quot;What do I have to lose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests Spread in Serbia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Serb-led forces withdrew from Kosovo at the end of NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia, protests across Serbia against President Slobodan Milosevic have multiplied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE truth is the first victim in any war. Both a propaganda war and a real war are now taking place in Kosovo and Yugoslavia. Contradicting information and conflicting opinions regarding this Balkan tragedy must confuse anyone who is not unusually well-informed about the background to this old Serbian/Albanian problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nato attack has no approval from the UN Security Council. Therefore, from a legal point of view, it is clear that air strikes on Yugoslavia are unjustifiable attacks on a sovereign country struggling with an internal problem -the Albanian separatist rebellions. Nato gave several reasons for the attack. Let's analyse those that were publicised:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* To get President Slobodan Milosevic to accept the Paris peace agreement. This document is not an agreement as it is not the result of negotiations but of an agreement between US and Albanian representatives. The proposals of the Yugoslav delegation were flatly rejected. This US/Albanian peace agreement is not a plan for Albanian autonomy within Serbia and Yugoslavia, as announced publicly, but for a two-phase separation of Kosovo from Serbia and Yugoslavia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kosovo would be a state within a state, with all the prerogatives of an independent country. Both the federal and Serbian governments would not have any authority there. After three years, its final status will be decided by the US and others based on a referendum among the people of Kosovo, 90 per cent of whom are Albanian. Such &quot;autonomy&quot; has not been known in our world. The Yugoslav proposal gives a very high level of autonomy to Kosovo, but it seems that autonomy is not on the real agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* To destroy Mr Milosevic's war machine. A year ago, Albanian separatists (the Kosovo Liberation Army) started this war with the declared goal of separating Kosovo from Serbia and Yugoslavia. All the current problems started then. The KLA attacked the police and army and started kidnapping and killing Serbs living in remote villages with Albanian majorities, and even Albanians opposed to KLA goals. Instead of neutralising separatists and extremists among the Albanians, Nato is now playing the role of KLA air force, and is practically fighting for Kosovo's independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Milosevic's war machine is simply the national army of Yugoslavia, and is doing what any army of any country would do in the case of a separatist rebellion. It is just trying to protect the integrity of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* To stop the genocide of Albanians in Kosovo and prevent a refugee crisis. The fact is that the massive exodus of refugees (and not only of Albanians) started after the Nato bombardment of Kosovo began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the main reason for the refugee tragedy is the bombardment, fighting between KLA and government forces, or pressure from paramilitary militias, is of secondary importance for the refugees. Those who started the civil war and those who later decided to strike Yugoslavia and Kosovo should take responsibility for all these sad consequences. More strikes can only produce more refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* To prevent a domino effect from the crisis. The strike against Yugoslavia cannot solve the complex and old problem between Albanians and Serbs. It can only make the situation worse. If Nato helps Albanians to realise their goal of independence for Kosovo, it will initiate a similar war in Macedonia where Albanians represent a significant minority (35 to 40 per cent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHAT IS THE REAL PROBLEM?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KOSOVO was the heart of Serbia for centuries. Serbian monasteries from the 12th and 13th centuries are evidence that Serbs populated Kosovo before Turks occupied Serbia in the 14th century and held it for the next 500 years. The Turks allowed fellow Muslims from Albania to migrate gradually to Kosovo. Many Serbs (as Christians) had to emigrate to the north, for example, to Vojvodina. So ethnic cleansing of Serbs by Albanians is not something new in Kosovo, but was the most &quot;effective&quot; in this century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbs were the ethnic majority in Kosovo even before World War II. But they now make up only 10 per cent of the population due to factors such as the high Albanian birth rate (nine-member families on average), the expulsion of Serbs during the German occupation, the influx of Albanian immigrants after the war and pressure on Serbs to leave Kosovo by hostile Albanians when the latter took control of Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Albanians practised a kind of &quot;soft&quot; ethnic cleansing in the last 60 years. When they achieved ethnic majority, they began to claim a legitimate right for separation and the creation of an independent Kosovo. They even organised an illegal referendum in 1990, declared the Independent Republic of Kosovo, and created illegal institutions such as a parliament and university. No country would tolerate such a separatist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Milosevic is a dictator, but he is not the cause of the Kosovo problem. He is more a Serbian problem than an Albanian one. If not for him, the Serbs' traditional allies (the US, France, Britain) would most likely not be against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is the old Albanian strategy of creating a Greater Albania by unifying Albania, Kosovo and parts of Macedonia and Montenegro populated by Albanian minorities in these sovereign states and regions. The KLA initiated this war a year ago and is fighting for this goal. Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and other Albanian parties in Kosovo also declared its independence as their goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albanians are not interested in autonomy, human rights and democratisation in Serbia. They have ignored elections in Serbia in the last 10 years, and Mr Milosevic used this to get up to 40 seats out of 250 in the Serbian Parliament, which were designated for the representatives of Kosovo. Without these he could not have ruled Serbia. Albanians used his non-democratic regime and bad international image as an excuse for their fight for independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pro-Western and democratic Serbian government would make their fight tougher, as it would expose its real nature as a fight for an ethnic state inside Greater Albania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AIR STRIKES WORSEN SITUATION IT WAS not realistic to expect that a few weeks of negotiations in France could produce a peaceful solution to the complex problem of Kosovo. Nor can a few weeks of bombing. Air strikes can only make the situation worse and result in the following consequences:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Cause a catastrophic humanitarian disaster among both Albanians and Serbs. No humanitarian reason can justify this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Unify the Serbs against Nato and eliminating the prospects of success for any pro-democratic and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parties in Serbia in their struggle for democratisation. Extreme nationalists will be the most influential political factor years from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The eventual creation of an independent Kosovo will trigger similar separatist aspirations among Albanians in Macedonia and Montenegro, and fresh Balkan disasters are then very likely. For Albanian radicals, an independent Kosovo is just the first phase in their struggle for Greater Albania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Attacking a sovereign country struggling with its internal ethnic problems despite the fact that it is against international law and the UN Charter, is the start of a doctrine that can cause many new crises in this already complicated and chaotic world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHAT IS THE SOLUTION? THE only way to stop the war is to strike those who started it -the KLA. The complex political problem must be solved peacefully through a real negotiation process. Mediation is necessary, but the mediators should be impartial. A more balanced peace plan must be proposed that would implement the principles declared by the Contact Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kosovo must have real autonomy, but as a province of Serbia. Yugoslavia must be democratic country integrated with other European countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And only a democratic Serbia may provide Albanians with their ethnic and human rights. But Albanians and other minorities cannot achieve their freedom and human rights if others in Serbia, including Serbs, don't have them. Building a democratic, multi-ethnic, peaceful and prosperous Yugoslavia must be the objective of Serbs, Kosovo Albanians and the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nato has the power. The only problem is how to channel it in the right direction: to stop the strikes in Yugoslavia, isolate extremists on both sides and prepare a fair proposal for Kosovo autonomy within Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the international community allows that an ethnic minority may separate a province (where it is in the majority) from a sovereign country, then it will encourage similar separatist aspirations and civil wars in other countries. This is against international law and the interests of the world community -including Nato countries.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Serbia, Oct. 8</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yugoslav President, Vojislav Kostunica, struggled today, his first in office, to consolidate his authority over Serbia and his own allies, trying to find a balance between revolutionary justice and legality in the post-Milosevic era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kostunica is president, but some in the 18-party coalition that backed him are afraid that his concern for legal niceties may prove costly in the uneasy vacuum of power that has followed Slobodan Milosevic's ouster.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already, there have been serious behind-the-scenes struggles for control of the police, the courts, the banking system and customs authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kostunica's coalition has formed a &quot;crisis committee&quot; that is a kind of parallel government to the Serbian authorities who were beholden to Mr. Milosevic. They are moving through institutions one by one, trying to ensure support for a new democratic authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are against revolutionary transformation, but there are always people for revolutionary change,&quot; said Dragor Hiber, a member of the crisis committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veran Matic, the president of ANEM, the Association of Independent Electronic Media, said the greatest danger to Mr. Kostunica &quot;is the question of the unity of the democratic opposition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kostunica's problems range from the enormous to the bizarre. One of the most bizarre concerns the visit on Tuesday of the French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine. Mr. Vedrine, along with President Clinton -- who called Mr. Kostunica today -- and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, were convicted in absentia of war crimes in a pre-election propaganda exercise here. Formally, Mr. Vedrine and the others face arrest and 20 years in jail, and their photographs are up on wanted posters in police stations and at the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostunica officials are afraid that the police may embarrass Mr. Vedrine at the airport. Mr. Kostunica can sign an amnesty, but that is considered politically awkward here. The public prosecutor can void the conviction, but the process is clumsy. So the officials are working, quietly, on the police not to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Clinton spoke to Mr. Kostunica this evening for five minutes to congratulate him. Mr. Kostunica has been reluctant to have William Montgomery, the ambassador who has been running the &quot;Yugoslav embassy in exile&quot; in Budapest, to be appointed the American ambassador in Belgrade when relations are restored. Mr. Montgomery's office in Budapest helped to run and fund the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign, which Mr. Kostunica regarded as overt meddling in Serbia's affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Kostunica would go along with the appointment, his aides say, if all sanctions against Yugoslavia are lifted, including the so-called outer wall, which blocks Yugoslav access to international financial institutions -- and thus to crucial loans and credits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Control of the police is a significant issue. The police did not in any serious way oppose the mass protest last Thursday that led to the burning of the federal Parliament, helped along by some prior agreements made with the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In today's issue of the daily Politika, Zoran Djindjic, head of the Democratic Party, the backbone of the opposition, said the police &quot;had reorganized, stabilized and realized what the interest of the people is, and the police have become practically immune to orders that could bring them into conflict with the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But knowledgeable officials say former police and security officials with connections to Mr. Djindjic attempted to take provisional control of Belgrade police headquarters on Friday morning and again this morning, telling the chief of police, Gen. Branko Djuric, to hand over his authority and his firearm. General Djuric called other opposition officials, with whom he had promised cooperation, and said he would shoot himself first. He asked for protection and someone to guard him at night. The situation has continued, but with the intervention this morning of Mr. Kostunica himself, it appears to have been calmed, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Milosevic's head of state security, Rade Markovic, is also said to have contacted Mr. Kostunica's aides complaining about death threats from former security officers, and has discussed resigning. Mr. Kostunica met privately today with top security officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, at the lucrative Customs Department, a close Milosevic ally, Mihalj Kertes, was pressured by armed men working for the opposition to leave office. Weapons were reportedly found in Mr. Kertes' office. To the surprise of Mr. Kostunica and some of his allies, a businessman named Dusan Zabunovic, who is considered close to Mr. Djindjic and owns an import company called M.P.S., was appointed head of customs. The selection caused such an uproar among the opposition leaders themselves that it was rescinded the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was another drama at the courts, with senior Milosevic judges like Milena Arezina, chief judge of the Serbian trade court, ordering the destruction of documents relating to sensitive cases, like the government takeover of the I.C.N. pharmaceutical company owned by Milan Panic, a Serb-American, and the cases against ABC Produkt, a publisher that owns an independent daily newspaper, Glas Javnosti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People working in the judiciary called opposition officials to warn them of the destruction of the files, some of which was stopped. There was a similar incident at the Foreign Ministry, though of lesser importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indicative of the problems was the drama on Saturday at the main state bank that clears payments between businesses, an organization known as the Zavod za Obracun Placanja, or Zop. The crisis committee was told that Milosevic officials were transferring large sums of money to private companies to pay for pre-election government purchases of cooking oil and sugar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company that created the bank's electronic data system agreed to crash the computers to stop the transactions, but allow for the payment of important benefits like pensions. The crisis committee then appointed Zivko Nesic, general manager of the bank until fired in 1998, to manage it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kostunica and his allies are also trying to assert control over the Serbian government and Parliament, which did not go through new elections. It has been dominated by Mr. Milosevic's coalition, which was allied with the Serbian Radical Party. If, however, the Radicals realign themselves with the Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> another party that was sometimes in opposition and sometimes allied with Mr. Milosevic, they could bring down the current government. Both those parties fear that new elections, which Mr. Kostunica wants in both the federal and Serbian parliaments within the next 90 days, will devastate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kostunica is trying to convince the Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, a wavering Milosevic ally who was also indicted by the war crimes tribunal, to dissolve the Serbian Parliament on the grounds that new elections are required to restore political stability. Mr. Milutinovic, not known for bravery, is being told that now is the time to move or face charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he does not help, and the two other parties do not play along, Mr. Kostunica and his allies are prepared to call for tens of thousands of citizens to rally in front of the Parliament, a form of threat.<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Serbia, March 28</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slobodan Milosevic, defiant as ever and proud of his nation's resistance to NATO's air attacks, staged an eerie celebration today -- a rock concert in the center of Belgrade to show solidarity with the soldiers facing down the allied assaults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few of the thousands of Serbs who attended were unaware that this was also the 10th anniversary of the day when Mr. Milosevic stripped broad autonomy from Kosovo, just after his security forces had killed some 30 ethnic Albanian protesters in Pristina, Kosovo's capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, the Serbian security forces are sweeping through Kosovo, driving tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians into panicked flight and provoking what Western officials described as the worst refugee crisis that Europe has seen in 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Belgrade, given strict censorship rules and the patriotic fever of wartime, few Serbs seemed to know much about events in Kosovo, or the Western reaction. They poured their scorn on the Americans, rejoicing in what Serbian television persistently called the shooting down of an F-117A stealth jet, and rallied around their nation -- and, by extension, its leader, Mr. Milosevic -- in a way not seen here in years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rock concert organized to celebrate the holiday known as &quot;the day of Serbia's statehood&quot; bore an ironic resemblance to similar concerts held by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrators during the mass pro-democracy demonstrations of 1996-97 in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same bands played today to some of the same people, by their own account, symbolizing the unifying effect that air strikes have had on the general population. &quot;Forget who is supporting whom, this is no time for divisions,&quot; said one of the leading singers at the rally, Dejan Cukic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the thousands at the afternoon rally -- called &quot;Songs Keep Us Alive and United&quot; -- wore small placards on their chests displaying a black target. One placard referred to the downing of the stealth aircraft, and read: &quot;F-117A. Sorry, we didn't know that you are invisible.&quot; Another redefined NATO as &quot;New American Terrorist Organization,&quot; while others compared President Clinton to Hitler, whose air force bombed Belgrade in 1941.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During much of the rally, Belgrade was under an air raid alert. The first bombs fell today at about 4 A.M., and then again at 8 A.M., with their detonations preceding any air raid sirens. Air raid warnings continued to howl after dark. Tonight, however, in contrast to Friday and Saturday night, when the city was plunged into darkness, most of Belgrade's street lights stayed on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Milosevic held a meeting of his Cabinet and military leaders and issued a statement praising the army and the citizenry. The two were linked &quot;by strong unity, a high patriotic conscience and determination to endure in the just struggle against the criminal aggressors,&quot; the statement said. &quot;Our citizens are demonstrating high personal responsibility and a high degree of mutual solidarity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no reference to increasingly blunt Western charges that Mr. Milosevic's armed forces and police units are engaged in widespread atrocities in Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western reporters with no access to Kosovo were largely reduced to interviewing the ethnic Albanian refugees pouring across its borders, a situation reminiscent of Cambodia in the mid-1970s, when the victorious Khmer Rouge emptied the cities and reporters had to piece together the scale of atrocities from the refugees who straggled into Thailand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Serbian state television's evening news, the Serbian Minister for Refugees, Bratislava Morina, whose late husband was a Kosovo Albanian Communist, suggested that ethnic Albanians were fleeing NATO bombs, not the Serbian military. &quot;If NATO wants these people to return to their homes, it should stop this aggression immediately,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the official Tanjug news agency did announce that NATO planes attacked before and after sunrise, targeting the air force base in the Belgrade suburb of Batajnica for the fourth consecutive day. Two other explosions cracked windows at Belgrade's main civilian airport, Surcin, 15 miles from the city center. Other missiles fell near Cacak, the site of a huge military factory in central Serbia, Tanjug said. In Kosovo, four bombs hit an army barracks outside Prizren, the agency said. There was no report of any casualties. To date, the Yugoslav media has talked of dozens killed in the air raids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the rally, words of general patriotism came from noted performers like Mr. Cukic and Momcilo Bagajic, known as Bajaga, who said, &quot;We should defend ourselves.&quot; Mr. Bagajic is known not to be a rabid nationalist, and he has played in other parts of the former Yugoslavia, like Slovenia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wrote a hugely popular and moving song about the Yugoslav civil wars, largely initiated by Mr. Milosevic, that says, &quot;My friends are pearls scattered all over the world.&quot; Ironically, the Government is now playing the song often on state television as a backdrop to patriotic pictures of the Yugoslav armed forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One member of the Children of Bad Musicians, a popular group, told the crowd, &quot;I used to play sax, but since that sex maniac plays it, I don't touch it anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olga, a 43-year-old economist wearing a fur vest and Italian shoes, said she never went to the air raid shelters because she could not bring her English setter, Loli. She is no fan of Mr. Milosevic, she said, but war is no time for divisions. &quot;I was in all the demonstrations for democracy,&quot; she said, &quot;but now I have to be in favor of defending my homeland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic Party and an organizer of the pro-democracy demonstrations, noted the irony. &quot;The bombs have marginalized any dissenters here, and there's little we democrats can do to affect the situation,&quot; he said. &quot;The same is also true of those democrats and moderates among the ethnic Albanians,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington has spent more on one day's bombs than it ever spent helping the democracy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Yugoslavia, Mr. Djindjic said bitterly. &quot;Milosevic could be far more easily eliminated through the development of democracy here than through air strikes,&quot; he said. &quot;Every crisis strengthens him. The only players that matter now are Milosevic, the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequences of the air strikes are &quot;this radicalized and pauperized Serbia and a destabilized Montenegro,&quot; whose independence Washington wants to encourage under President Milo Djukanovic, Mr. Djindjic said. Yugoslavia consists of Serbia and Montenegro, and Mr. Djukanovic is a former protege of Mr. Milosevic who in the last year has turned against the Yugoslav President. &quot;Now Djukanovic is compromised by the bombs, and there is more anti-American feeling in the entire region,&quot; Mr. Djindjic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are Yugoslav military and police depots and headquarters in Montenegro, and NATO has bombed them freely, despite a statement by Mr. Djukanovic that Montenegro would stay neutral in any fight between NATO and Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Djindjic and Mr. Djukanovic are close, and Mr. Djukanovic told him the day the bombs started dropping that no one in the American Government ever telephoned to explain the situation or to warn him, Mr. Djindjic said. &quot;Ordinary people in Montenegro will now say that Djukanovic based his entire policy on America, but we're getting bombed just as badly as Milosevic,&quot; Mr. Djindjic said. &quot;This will make it much more difficult for Montenegro to secede.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evening news gave a hint of a Russian initiative to solve this crisis, announcing that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and Mr. Milosevic had exchanged letters. But the Yugoslav Ambassador to Moscow, Mr. Milosevic's brother, Borislav, said he could not confirm that the two Presidents would meet, and there was no indication that a Russian delegation, which arrived tonight and includes former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, would get anywhere with its own peace initiative. France said it was pressing the Russian Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, to seek a diplomatic solution. Russia is a traditional backer of Serbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time today, the Yugoslav Government organized a junket for some 70 foreign journalists here -- dominated by non-NATO countries like Japan -- to the site where the F-117A crashed, in Budjanovci, 30 miles northwest of Belgrade. Reporters, in two buses, were only allowed to see the remains of a wing while local villagers danced with evident joy at this small triumph of their hugely outgunned military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A young boy wearing a knitted cap with the logo of the Chicago Bulls stood on the American Air Force star painted on the wing, while the assembled cameramen scrambled for angles. The boy had a toy pistol in one hand while he tried to make the Serbian victory sign with the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evening news said that, in addition to the wartime censorship that now applies to media, new wartime banking rules were established to fund the military, and that profiteering would be punished severely. In the newspaper Glas Javnosti today, there was a story about the arrest of the first &quot;war profiteers&quot; in the city of Nis, a man and his son who owned a gas station and were hoarding 3,171 liters of gasoline, 5,300 liters of diesel fuel and 1,000 liters of oil. Gasoline is nearly unavailable now except on the black market, where the price has now reached almost 10 German marks a liter, many times its price a week ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the back page, however, there was a story about the opening of the yearly automobile show at the Belgrade Fair, featuring a photograph of the new Volkswagen Beetle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also today, Dragoslav Rancic, a senior contributing editor of the weekly magazine Nin, and his editor, Stevan Niksic, were released from police custody. They were arrested early on Saturday for offending censorship regulations with an article about Mr. Milosevic's negotiating style. Friends said they had not been beaten by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Belgrade newspaper published a word about their arrest, a sharp contrast to the solidarity local journalists displayed when Veran Matic, the chief editor of the banned radio station B92, was detained for eight hours last Wednesday. But on Wednesday night, the first NATO bombs fell on Belgrade, and, as one local journalist said bitterly, &quot;media solidarity is evidently another casualty.&quot;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after the eruption of Serbia's present political crisis, a cartoon appeared in a local newspaper that summed up the critical choice facing Europe's last old-style communist boss. The drawing showed Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic standing at a fork in the road. A signpost offered him a choice of two directions: &quot;Europe&quot; and &quot;Romania.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper readers understood &quot;Europe&quot; as shorthand for the introduction of the rule of law, radical economic reform and an end to the international isolation that resulted from Serbia's involvement in the 3 1/2-year war in neighboring Bosnia. &quot;Romania,&quot; by contrast, was the code word for a full-blooded communist dictatorship cut off from the outside world and condemned to a future of economic penury.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been 50 days since protests erupted in Belgrade over the alleged theft of local elections by the Milosevic government. Seemingly oblivious to the political turmoil all around him, the Serbian strongman has been hesitating in front of the imaginary signpost, either unwilling or unable to take an irrevocable step in one direction or another. In the view of most political analysts, time is now running out for him to make a decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are living on a knife edge,&quot; said Ivan Stambolic, a former Serbian president and political mentor to Milosevic who was forced out of office in 1987 after his protege embraced the cause of Serb nationalism. &quot;Neither side wants to resort to violence, but the situation is so tense that a single incident could spark a general conflagration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's problem, and the best explanation for his hesitation, is that either course leads to likely political oblivion. The experience of Eastern Europe has shown that any communist leader who introduces democracy and radical economic reform is almost certain to be booted out of office in the next election. If he resorted to the Romanian variant, he might succeed in holding on to power a little longer, but could eventually suffer the fate of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was executed by his own army on Dec. 25, 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past weeks, Milosevic has alternated between repression and reconciliation, and today was no exception. This afternoon, riot police were out on the streets of Belgrade to enforce a ban on marches by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrators. This evening, however, the Serbian government made a significant concession to the opposition coalition known as Together by acknowledging an election defeat in the southern city of Nis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most striking things about the present crisis has been Milosevic's own silence. His last big public appearance was on Dec. 24, when he addressed a rally of his supporters in Belgrade. A week later, he gave a three-minute televised address to mark New Year's Eve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past month, Milosevic has withdrawn into self-imposed seclusion, refusing to meet with Western diplomats or the more liberal wing of the ruling coalition. Instead, he has surrounded himself with political cronies and appears to be relying heavily for advice on his wife, Mirjana Markovic, a hard-boiled Marxist ideologist and founder of the hard-line Yugoslav United Left party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In essence, he rules alone,&quot; said a former political ally who recently fell out with Milosevic. &quot;He has created a kind of virtual reality for himself. If something does not fit into his plan, he thinks there is something wrong with reality and that it is simply necessary to change the person who was unable to carry out his orders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This source compared Serbian politics to Indonesian shadow-puppet plays: &quot;You can see the figures, but the real play is taking place in the shadows. There are two parallel systems of government, one of which is public and has no power. The other government exists in secret, and has all the power but no responsibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western diplomats and Serbian officials alike worry that there is practically no one in Milosevic's inner entourage who is prepared to tell him the truth. According to these accounts, one of the few people in Belgrade who is ready to speak frankly with the Serbian leader is the U.S. charge d'affaires, Richard Miles. Milosevic, however, has refused to meet with Miles or any other Western ambassador for the past month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is mad at the Americans because he thinks that they have cheated him,&quot; said a pro-Milosevic politician, noting that the United States had relied on Milosevic to push through the 1995 Dayton peace agreement on Bosnia. &quot;The hard-liners are playing on this anger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to this source, Milosevic initially appeared willing to accept the loss of Belgrade and other cities in the Nov. 17 elections. In private conversations, he predicted that the opposition would rapidly demonstrate its political incompetence and be unable to deal with the huge problems of running a big city. &quot;They have a plane, but they don't have a pilot,&quot; the Serbian president remarked scornfully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something happened during the next two days, however, to make Milosevic change his mind about the wisdom of surrendering control over Serbia's big cities. It is widely assumed that his wife and other hard-liners in her party, a member of Serbia's ruling coalition, persuaded Milosevic not to risk allowing the opposition to gain such a prominent political platform for its views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, Milosevic has shown himself to be an extraordinarily agile politician, capable of some stunning U-turns. An orthodox communist until 1987, he helped to plunge Yugoslavia into war by transforming himself virtually overnight into the advocate of a Greater Serbia that would incorporate Serb-populated areas of Croatia and Bosnia. In 1993, he switched course once again and denounced his former Bosnian Serb allies for &quot;suicidal&quot; nationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to associates, Milosevic frequently takes a long time to make up his mind, weighing all the options before him. On this occasion, however, his penchant for procrastination is turning into a liability. The longer he waits, the stronger the opposition becomes and the more concessions he will have to make to negotiate a solution to the crisis. Time is against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only thing that Milosevic is concerned about is power, and that power is being eroded day by day,&quot; said Miodrag Perisic, a leader of the Democratic Party, which belongs to the Together coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What started out as a relatively manageable protest against stolen elections has now mushroomed into a full-fledged democracy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition leaders have made clear that they will not be satisfied with partial concessions, such as control of the Nis city government. The minimum political price for ending the street demonstrations is full access to the media and a level playing field for Serbia's presidential and parliamentary elections, which are scheduled later this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans plan to push Medicare drug proposal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - House Republicans will flesh out their proposal for Medicare drug benefits this week and try to push it through two House committees in three days, despite fierce objections from many Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans said Sunday that they would combine their drug plan with a proposal to give more money to health maintenance organizations - perhaps $4 billion over five years - in hopes of halting the exodus of HMOs from Medicare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last two years, HMOs pulling out of Medicare have disrupted insurance arrangements for more than 700,000 elderly people, and many more health plans are expected to withdraw this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Republican proposal, the government would subsidize private insurance to cover pharmaceutical costs for Medicare beneficiaries. Such insurance, covering only drug costs, is now unavailable, and insurance companies say they do not intend to sell it, but the Republicans have set aside up to $40 billion over the next five years to buy it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A summary of the House Republican plan says the government would guarantee access to drug coverage if private insurers did not offer it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton: Clinton, Gore, Reno will be prosecuted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - The chief Republican congressional investigator of political fund raising in 1996 said he is likely to refer President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Attorney General Janet Reno for prosecution after a new president takes office next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said Sunday it appears Reno obstructed justice by refusing several times to request special prosecutors to investigate Clinton and Gore for money-raising irregularities during their campaign four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton and Gore knew they were breaking the law concerning illegal campaign contributions, Burton said, but &quot;I can't give you the specifics of it right now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's chief of staff, John Podesta, said Burton's main intent is to inflict political damage on Gore in his run for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-smog formula helps hike gas prices</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAMARILLO, Calif. - Gasoline prices climbed 8.82 cents a gallon in the past three weeks as a new kind of reformulated gas made its way to the pumps, giving some cities an average price of more than $2 a gallon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High crude oil prices, rising demand and new anti-smog regulations affecting 17 metropolitan areas pushed the nationwide average cost to $1.6723 a gallon Friday, analyst Trilby Lundberg said Sunday. That compares to the May 19 Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide that found a national average of $1.5841.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metropolitan areas with some of the worst air pollution in the nation were required by June 1 to start using a new kind of gas that is designed to preserve air quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lundberg predicted gasoline prices might drop slightly in coming weeks, especially if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decides to increase production this month. But the price won't come near last year's weighted average on June 11 of $1.19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMA urges doctors to boost membership</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO - The American Medical Association is asking doctors to become salespeople to boost its flagging membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it remains America's largest group of doctors, only about a third of the nation's 800,000-plus physicians, medical residents and medical students belong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Membership, now at 293,695, is down about 2 percent from the end of last year, Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr., the AMA's executive vice president, told delegates attending the first day of the annual AMA meeting Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Membership woes are &quot;the thousand-pound gorilla in the living room,&quot; said Anderson, who urged doctors to pressure their colleagues and recruit non-members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CIA, FBI decide Iranian defector is imposter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - The CIA and FBI reportedly have concluded that an Iranian defector who claims to be a former intelligence official and terrorist mastermind is an impostor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defector claimed to have masterminded the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, and the 1996 attack against a U.S. military installation in Saudi Arabia. Two Libyans are now on trial for the Pan Am bombing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A U.S. intelligence official quoted anonymously in The Washington Post on Sunday said the CIA and FBI concluded the defector lied during interviews with intelligence officials and lacked basic knowledge of Iran's intelligence apparatus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials have doubted the defector's credibility since he first told his story on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; on CBS June 4. Iran vehemently denied the defector's claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INTERNATIONAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's allies say West sullied Montenegro vote</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PODGORICA, Yugoslavia - Allies of President Slobodan Milosevic accused the West of using financial aid to buy votes in Montenegro's local elections, which were held Sunday in two cities and were seen as a referendum on the republic's pro-Western policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voting reportedly went smoothly in the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica, and the coastal town of Herceg Novi. After the polls closed, however, police had to separate pro-and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> groups in Podgorica as tensions rose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First returns were not expected before early today. However, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> groups, confident of victory in Podgorica, drove in convoys throughout the city, honking horns in celebration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the elections were for local posts, the two towns account for one-third of the republic's registered voters. As a result, Sunday's elections provided the first electoral test for supporters of Montenegro's pro-Western President Milo Djukanovic, who took office in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israelis, Palestinians leave for treaty talks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JERUSALEM - Israeli and Palestinian negotiators left Sunday for peace treaty talks in Washington, despite the uncertainty cast over the Middle East by Syrian President Hafez Assad's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Palestinians for the first time can expect Israel's undivided attention, since a resumption of Israeli-Syrian talks in the near future is very unlikely. Assad's successor, apparently his son Bashar, will need time to consolidate his rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When talks on both tracks were proceeding simultaneously last winter, the Palestinians were worried that Israel would play one Arab partner against the other to extract concessions on both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said Sunday that Assad's death could give Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat more freedom in the negotiations. In the past, Assad has been sharply critical of Arafat for negotiating a separate peace with Israel. Several Palestinian groups opposed to peace with Israel are based in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reformers get posts in Iran's parliament</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEHRAN, Iran - A one-time hard-liner and veteran revolutionary who now favors democratic reforms was elected Sunday as the speaker of Iran's first reformist-dominated parliament in more than 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehdi Karrubi was elected unopposed in a compromise between hard-liners and moderates who said they wanted to avoid further tension at a time when the two factions are locked in a power struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two leading reformers, including Mohammad-Reza Khatami, brother of the liberal president, were elected deputy speakers of the 290-seat Majlis, or parliament, during a session broadcast live on state-run Tehran radio. Nine other deputies elected to parliamentary offices also are top allies of President Mohammad Khatami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Majlis speaker is the third most powerful person after the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petroleum meeting draws protesters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CALGARY, Alberta - Waving posters and colorful papier-mYch, puppets, hundreds of protesters demonstrated against global energy policies Sunday at the start of the five-day World Petroleum Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The congress, comprising more than 2,500 delegates from 87 countries representing the oil industry, was the latest target of anti-globalization groups who protested the World Trade Organization and the Organization of American States in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators called for developing renewable energy sources such as wind power and solar power while reducing reliance on pollution-causing fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearful of street clashes that hindered a WTO meeting in Seattle in December, police imposed stringent security measures. Six-foot-high green fencing created a security zone around a six-block area that surrounding the convention site. Officers armed with riot gear, including pepper spray, batons and bulletproof vests, patrolled the perimeter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haitians cast ballots in local, legislative races</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti - Haitians voted Sunday in local and legislative elections in the southern Grand'-Anse District, where voting was postponed on May 21 because of technical problems and political disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no violence during the vote, election office president Benoit Guerrier said, despite long lines caused when some stations opened late. Results were expected later this week, with a run-off round scheduled for June 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter turnout appeared to be good, an indication that residents were ignoring opposition parties who had called for a boycott. Those parties have complained that the May 21 vote was tainted to favor the Lavalas Family Party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two upper-house and 11 lower-house seats were up for election. Eighteen mayoral commissions and hundreds of urban and rural councils were also on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe leader raps U.N. on vote monitoring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe's president accused the United Nations of trying to hijack international monitoring of his country's parliamentary elections, which many doubted could be free and fair amid rampant political violence, a newspaper reported Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations overstepped its welcome in trying to coordinate election monitoring, President Robert Mugabe complained to a state newspaper, a week after U.N. observers pulled out of the country's election monitoring operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many questioned whether Zimbabwe was even capable of holding fair elections. At least 31 people have been killed in political violence since February. The main opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for Democratic Change announced Sunday that another organizer had died after being tortured by ruling party supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The June 24-25 election poses the biggest challenge to Mugabe since he led the nation to independence from Britain in 1980.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under growing pressure to stop large-scale Serb atrocities against ethnic Albanians, NATO forces on Sunday intensified air attacks on Yugoslavia, but rejected calls to invade with ground troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the alliance launched its fifth day of airstrikes against Serb military targets throughout Yugoslavia, it stepped up attacks on targets in and around Kosovo, the province where Serb forces are believed to be escalating a bloody campaign against ethnic Albanian civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday evening's attacks involved several dozen jet fighters from Italy and at least a pair of B-52 bombers based in England. The targets included an expanding list of military bunkers, ammunition dumps and fuel depots used by Yugoslav troops in and around Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air-raid sirens sounded in downtown Belgrade at least four times between 4 p.m. and early Sunday evening. Each time, cruise missiles landed on sites that couldn't be identified immediately.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Sunday, at least three cruise missiles plowed into a Yugoslav air base near Batajnica. It was the fourth straight day that the base, one of the largest in Yugoslavia, had been hit by a cruise missile attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Genocide is starting'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling the expanding air assault a &quot;race against time,&quot; NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said: &quot;We are on the brink of a major humanitarian disaster in Kosovo, the likes of which Europe has not seen since the closing stages of World War II.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Genocide is starting,&quot; German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said in a television interview with station ZDF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of ethnic Albanians fleeing &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; in Kosovo choked highways Sunday into neighboring Macedonia and Albania, where relief workers scrambled to provide the refugees with basic aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said as many as 18,000 Serb soldiers are massing for an offensive against the Kosovo Albanians. Pentagon officials said the Yugoslav troops would be attacked when spotted by U.S. jets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are terrible reports about men and women, men being separated from women and children, then . . . being taken off and executed, villages being torched, people arriving across the border with no shoes, and literally told to leave their villages,&quot; Albright said on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After days of pointing to increasing atrocities as justification for the decision to attack, U.S. officials Sunday shifted tactics as they found themselves insisting the airstrikes did not cause the increased bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albright said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic &quot;was planning to do this anyway. It is just simply an upside-down argument to think that NATO or we have made this get worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense Secretary William Cohen said Sunday that the air campaign would not be deterred by the downing Saturday of a F-117A stealth fighter near the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade. Serb authorities boasted that they shot down the plane, the first NATO aircraft to have been downed in the conflict. But U.S. officials said Sunday they had not yet determined conclusively whether the plane was shot down or crashed for some other reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Clinton said after a meeting with his national security advisers at the White House on Sunday that he was relieved the American pilot was rescued. He reminded Americans again that &quot;this military operation entails real risks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he added that &quot;the continued brutality and repression of the Serb forces further underscores the need for NATO to persevere&quot; and said he strongly supports the decision to expand the airstrikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're looking at an expanded set of targets, and we're going to go more intensively after some targets,&quot; said NATO Commander Gen. Wesley Clark, a U.S. Army general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're entering a phase which is more focused on trying to stop the humanitarian catastrophe which is taking place on the ground,&quot; said NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana from his headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope John Paul II used his Palm Sunday address in Rome to urge a peaceful solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is never too late to meet and negotiate,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic told Russian television that his government is ready to return to peace talks if NATO stops bombing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You cannot talk under bombs. There can be no agreement under bombs,&quot; he said. But he did not indicate Yugoslavia would accept the peace agreement already signed by the ethnic Albanians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While NATO warplanes and missiles Sunday were aimed at some ground troops and even more military targets like headquarters and command bunkers, they were still trying to find and destroy Yugoslavia's sophisticated air-defense system. Serb forces have frustrated NATO officials by rarely using their surface-to-air missiles and thus not exposing them to likely destruction by NATO forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO needs to take out the air defenses to clear the way for the slower and lower-flying planes like the A-10 Warthog that will ultimately be needed to effectively attack the 300 or so Serb tanks used to shell ethnic Albanianvillages and to support the ground troops that are suspected of storming through the countryside and committing atrocities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yugoslavia's Tanjug state news agency reported that on Sunday night seven missiles hit near Pristina, close enough to break windows at the central hotel that houses the Serbian Media Center. It also said two explosions shook the northern Serbian town of Sombor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The missiles that rained on Pristina targeted Mount Veternik to the southwest and suburban Ajvalija, where a large army barracks is located, Tanjug said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency also said that up to 20 missiles had hit the region of Gnjilane, 22 miles southeast of Pristina. Initial reports said at least three people had been wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ground troops needed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failure so far to deter Serb aggression against the ethnic Albanians raised fresh questions Sunday about whether the bombing can stop the Serbs or whether NATO ultimately would be forced to invade or arm the ethnic Albanian resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Kosovo Liberation Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know myself of any war . . . that's been won totally by air power,&quot; said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to exercise every option,&quot; said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. &quot;We have to do whatever it takes. All of us would grieve at the loss of a single American. But when you go into these things, the primary purpose cannot be the safety of your forces. It has to be the achievement of your strategic and tactical goals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger echoed that, saying, &quot;We have to take whatever measures are necessary, even, reluctantly, introducing ground forces if that is the only way to accomplish it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., a supporter of the NATO assault, agreed that airstrikes alone would not stop the &quot;ethnic cleansing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly you can't stop the kind of slaughter and terrorism on the ground without some contradictory opposing force on the ground,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lieberman said he opposes a NATO or American invasion, preferring instead that the alliance supply arms to the Kosovo Albanians and let them fight for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. and NATO officials ruled out any use of alliance soldiers or arms on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have no intention of sending ground forces,&quot; said White House national security adviser Samuel &quot;Sandy&quot; Berger. &quot;We will continue this campaign as long as it is necessary, until the job is finished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on CNN that it would take &quot;hundreds of thousands of ground troops over a rather protracted period of time and in a very dangerous situation&quot; to invade Yugoslavia and forcefully stop Serb repression of ethnic Albanians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton and NATO have committed to deploying troops in Kosovo to enforce a peace agreement if the Serbs sign it, and NATO officials appeared less rigid in ruling out the use of ground troops at some time in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know how things are going to evolve, but at this point troops will not be deployed on the ground,&quot; Solana said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgrade rock concert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a defiant Milosevic staged a rock concert in the center of Belgrade on Sunday to show solidarity with the soldiers facing down the allied assaults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday was also the 10th anniversary of the day Milosevic stripped broad autonomy from Kosovo, just after his security forces had killed some 30 ethnic Albanian protesters in Pristina, Kosovo's capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Belgrade, given strict censorship rules and the patriotic fever of wartime, few Serbs seemed to know much about the events in Kosovo or Western reaction to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concert organized to celebrate the holiday known as &quot;the day of Serbia's statehood&quot; bore an ironic resemblance to similar concerts held by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrators during the mass pro-democracy demonstrations of 1996-97 in Belgrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same bands played Sunday to some of the same people, by their ownaccount symbolizing the unifying effect that airstrikes have had on the general population. &quot;Forget who is supporting whom, this is no time for divisions,&quot; said one of the lead singers at the rally, Dejan Cukic.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS week in his cell at the maximum security Whitemoor prison, Barry George was given the news he'd been waiting years to hear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Criminal Cases Review Commission announced he had won the right to a fresh appeal against his conviction for the murder of Jill Dando. A spokesman added there was a &quot;real possibility&quot; he could walk free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 42-year-old was at the centre of the largest criminal investigation since the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper when he was given a life sentence in 2001 for the murder of TV's golden girl. It was a crime which sickened the nation and put the police under enormous pressure to find the culprit. Yet, as his lawyers will claim at the new hearing, expected in the autumn, there is not enough evidence to support George's conviction - and more than reasonable doubt to quash the verdict.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is, says his lawyer Jeremy Moore, &quot;obviously very pleased and hopeful. The prison isn't equipped to deal with his condition, with the psychological difficulties he has as a result of brain damage caused by epilepsy. He has been finding it very difficult to cope with life inside.&quot; Soon he may not have to. The Commission ruled that too much emphasis was placed on the only piece of forensic evidence which linked George to the murder. This concerns a microscopic speck of firearms discharge residue found deep in George's coat pocket. It was crucial to the prosecution's case and described as &quot;compelling evidence of guilt&quot; at his trial. The jury heard a scientist confirm it was clearly a firearms deposit and matched traces in Dando's hair and clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But explaining the new ruling, Commission chairman Graham Zellick argues it could have come from anywhere. &quot;Whereas considerable weight was placed on it at the trial, our conclusion is that it cannot bear that weight, if it can bear any weight at all, &quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeal will now decide whether this renders George's conviction unsafe, in which case it will be overturned. It will then decide if there should be a new trial - although legal experts think this unlikely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a paucity of the evidence in the first place, &quot; says Moore. &quot;A very weak prosecution case was held together by this forensic evidence. Without that, the rest of the case does not stand up to scrutiny.&quot; Jill Dando, who was to marry her fianc&eacute; Alan Farthing, was walking back to her house in Gowan Avenue, Fulham, on the morning of Monday, April 26, 1999, when she met her assassin. She was ordered to kneel on the path outside her home and he fired a single gunshot into her head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT TOOK police 13 months to arrest George, who lived alone in a rundown, dingy flat 500 yards from Dando's home. On one level, he certainly fitted the profile. He was a lonely and disturbed misfit who inhabited a fantasy world, believing he was a cousin of Freddie Mercury and even adopting the rocker's original surname of Bulsara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had stalked dozens of women, had a conviction for attempted rape and received a three-month suspended jail sentence for indecent assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also had an &quot;interest&quot; in guns and was once arrested after being discovered in the grounds of Kensington Palace dressed in combat fatigues, carrying a knife, a rope and a letter to Princess Diana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Dando case, there was no witness, no murder weapon and no motive but three witnesses claimed to have seen a man who looked like George around her house on the day of the murder. A single fibre on the coat Dando was wearing when she was shot matched fibres on a pair of George's trousers - something which was insufficient to prove they had definitely been in contact but, according to the prosecution, &quot;is nonetheless consistent with such contact having occurred&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case also relied on George's reputation as a stalker and his celebrity obsession - the fact that he had written notes on Britt Ekland and Suzanne Dando and photocards of Anthea Turner and Emma Freud. George had also lied about his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to police and tried to create a false alibi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the prosecution case hinged on the speck of firearms residue. Its credibility is not only undermined by the suggestion that police searching George's flat were armed when they entered it. There is also the possibility that it could have been contaminated by being left in an unsealed room full of police evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major BBC Panorama programme in autumn last year quoted firearms expert Professor Marco Morin, who believes the single particle may not even have come from a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott Lomax, author of Justice For Jill: How The Wrong Man Was Jailed For The Murder Of Jill Dando, agrees. &quot;One of the things I discovered was that the alleged particle could have originated from a firework, &quot; says Lomax. &quot;George's best friend told me he used to collect fireworks and put them in his pocket. At trial, they were so obsessed with the idea of contamination from the labs where the jacket was examined that they didn't explore fully any other possibilities.&quot; The Panorama programme additionally coaxed revealing comments from one of the jurors. George was convicted by a 10-1 majority and Janet Herbert was the dissenting voice. She told the BBC: &quot;I just felt shocked that on that little evidence anybody could be locked away. It might have been him, don't get me wrong, but you have to reach a verdict on the evidence.&quot; The issue of the firearms residue is the only ground on which the case has been referred back to the Court of Appeal (George lost his first appeal in 2002 based on a different premise) but George's lawyer says he is &quot;entitled to apply for leave to put forward additional grounds&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two other main areas on which the defence would concentrate - George's mental state and the lack of a credible witness. George had suffered a mild form of brain damage and was in the bottom one per cent of the population in a psychological test of life skills. His uncle Michael Bourke argues that his nephew possesses neither the mental nor physical ability to carry out the crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barry is not the brightest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was a killing carried out with such efficiency. Barry is the sort of person who would have panicked or tried to hide if he had committed the crime, but people at the advice centre he visited that day said he arrived completely calm.&quot; Whoever the killer is had the foresight to press the gun against Dando's temple, making it virtually silent - significantly, a next-door neighbour heard a cry but no gunshot - and guarding against any blood spraying on his clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the murder weapon - never found - was a replica firearm, a short automatic smooth barrelled 9mm which had been specially modified. Much had been made of George's gun obsession but his experience was less than technical and it is unlikely he would have had the necessary skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the guy who could not even put a new lamp on his bike, &quot; says former Met commander John O'Connor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George also suffers from a personality disorder, according to Lomax: &quot;One of the allegations at the trial was that he reacted out of all proportion for an innocent man but the jury were never made aware that George suffers from Histrionic Personality Disorder and sufferers react in dramatic ways to news.&quot; Aside from his mental disabilities, there is also a question mark over credible witnesses. Twelve people went to ID parades but eight failed to pick out George. Of the remainder, three had what is termed &quot;qualified identification&quot; and the one who immediately picked him out - Susan Mayes - merely said he was in Dando's street at 7am on the day of the killing whereas the shooting took place at about 11.30. She also identified George 18 months after the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George's attempts to create a false alibi could also be explained by the fact he had been questioned about the Rachel Nickell murder on Wimbledon Common in 1992, despite being innocent, and he was afraid he could be a suspect again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also no evidence that George had any obsession with Dando. Police found 736 newspapers in his flat of which eight had reference to her - but none were highlighted or cut out. There were hundreds of photos of women that George had stalked but none was the Crimewatch presenter. There remain a disturbing number of question marks in the case against George. &quot;He has spent seven extremely difficult years in custody for a conviction which we believe that, in the fullness of time, will be seen as one of the gravest miscarriages of justice of recent years, &quot; says his lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Barry George didn't kill Jill Dando, who did? Various conspiracy theories have been put forward, one being that she was targeted by a particular crime boss due to her work presenting Crimewatch, but the strongest theory is that she was assassinated by a Serbian hitman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PERHAPS this is not so farfetched given the political situation of the time. Britain was at war with Serbia and had started bombing military targets in Kosovo in March 1999 and civilian targets from April. Tony Blair said this was necessary to put an end to the &quot;Serb killing machine&quot; but Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic reacted with his customary brutal revenge, ordering Kosovar Albanians to leave or be shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three weeks before she died, Jill Dando fronted the Kosovo Crisis Appeal on national television, thereby becoming the public face of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days before her death, Nato bombed a TV station in Belgrade, killing 16 journalists, including a young make-up artist for the RTS station in Belgrade called Jelica Munitlak. She was a favourite of Milosevic who always did his make-up when he came to the station and the pair had established a friendship. It is claimed the dictator ordered his twisted warlord Arkan to arrange for Dando's assassination as retaliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Milosevic didn't have the might for a full-scale bomb attack, Israeli intelligence services had already warned Nato that two-man Serb teams were attacking &quot;targets of opportunity&quot;. Jill Dando was one of the highest profile presenters of the time and had become a target through the Kosovan appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day she was killed was also the day the funerals of the 16 Serbians who had died took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During George's trial, defence barrister Michael Mansfield QC revealed there were five or six calls to the BBC linking Dando's murder with the Serbian incident. &quot;Your government and in particular your prime minister, Blair, butchered 16 young people, &quot; said one. &quot;He butchered, we butcher back.&quot; It was also the opinion of a former high ranking MI5 spy, David Phillips, who had a deep understanding of assassination techniques used by Eastern European countries, and who expressed his views in writing to the police officer in charge of the investigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hours later, it would occur to my brother that the police had probably watched him from the moment he left the apartment. There would have been one to watch the building (a man pretending to work on his car, perhaps -- he'd seen that ruse before) and another to trail him at a distance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a quiet morning, and Mike was not thinking about being abducted. He sipped from a green ceramic mug as he walked. The sight of him drinking coffee while walking past a sidewalk cafe confused many people in Belgrade. Coffee should be drunk while sitting at a table, they told him. One cup required approximately 30 minutes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike loved this sort of attention. But it was necessary to fit in at times. He found it rather serendipitous that the Belgrade telephone directory included a few other Staresinics. He took to introducing himself as &quot;Meeko,&quot; and he spoke our surname as if our grandparents had never left the village in nearby Slovenia -- &quot;starRUSHinitch,&quot; instead of the Americanized pronunciation, which rhymes with &quot;arsenic.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As usual, he took one of several indirect routes to the office flat. A man who passes the same place at the same time on two consecutive mornings is a man on his way to work, and Mike could not appear to be a man with a job. This is why he never referred to the rented flat as &quot;the office,&quot; which is exactly what it was. It was October 2000 and he had no permission to work in the Yugoslav republic of Serbia. Had he requested permission, he would have been escorted to the nearest border and expelled, or worse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On paper, he was a resident alien -- an American married to a Serb. In truth, he was on the payroll of Freedom House, a nonprofit organization based in Washington. He administered grants to local activist groups, independent media organizations and human rights advocates who wanted to create a more civil and democratic society. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike did not want to ever be in possession of anything that would incriminate him. The money came from elsewhere and he sure as hell didn't deliver it. He considered every piece of paper, every e-mail, every communique. Could it be used as evidence? On this particular day, he was going to the flat to organize the only sort of receipts he dared keep. They were for mundane things like gasoline, hotel rooms, fax paper, copy paper and toner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike's wife, Nevena, was in bed when he slipped out of the apartment. It was just as well. She couldn't have done anything to protect him and she needed her rest. She was six months pregnant, and exhausted from the march through Belgrade the day before where she joined the thousands demanding that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic acknowledge his electoral defeat. Friends and strangers, shocked to see her standing -- distended belly to belly -- with riot police, had said she ought to be at home, or at least in the rear of the demonstration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was probably still asleep when Mike, several blocks away, heard the mug shatter. He didn't see it hit the ground. Three of them had rushed him from behind. He yelled for the police, hoping to attract witnesses. He cursed loudly and swung his fists until he was forced to the ground. One of his assailants breathed halting English into his ear, &quot;We are the police.&quot; They switched back to their own language and demanded to know if he spoke Serbian. He pretended not to understand. He was handcuffed, jerked to his feet, silenced with a meaty hand across his mouth, and pushed to the end of a narrow stone passageway. His eyeglasses had come off in the scuffle, but he made out a passerby in a tight green dress and heels, watching from the corners of her eyes. When the hand was removed to help him into the car, he seized his chance. &quot;Call my wife!&quot; He shouted his telephone number in Serbian as they shoved him into the back and slammed the door. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting arrested was bad, but getting arrested without witnesses was exponentially worse. Sometimes people just disappeared. One officer said, &quot;I thought you didn't speak Serbian,&quot; and punched him in the head. The officer in the front passenger seat cursed and pounded the dash. &quot;Jesus Christ! I can't believe he yelled his phone number!&quot; He glared at Mike, then spat words into a mobile telephone. &quot;He called out his wife's telephone number! What do we do now?&quot; Mike wondered if Nevena would get word of this. They'd been so vigilant lately, calling each other every few hours. People they were close to were getting arrested and harassed. Maybe she'd grow suspicious and walk to the flat. Maybe she'd attempt to retrace his steps only to find spilled coffee and a broken mug. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Marriage of Inconvenience </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutual friends had arranged for Mike Staresinic to meet Nevena Antonijevic in a Belgrade cafe more than two years earlier, in 1998. She thought he was the most un-European man she'd ever seen. He wore a T-shirt that read &quot;Budapest&quot; tucked into green shorts with running shoes and white socks. He wasn't tall or fat, but there was a broadness in his shoulders that seemed to extend all the way to his ankles. He had a handsome, roundish face and thin lips that curled into a nice little smile. His flat brown hair was parted on one side and combed over to the other, exactly the way our father had styled it back in the '70s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevena, whose name sounds like &quot;heaven&quot; but with an extra syllable, was very cosmopolitan. Her hair was recently bleached blond and she'd spent a lot of time on her makeup that day. Her blue eyes were sultry beneath a strong Balkan brow. She was learning to speak English, and when Mike greeted her in broken Serbian, she coolly assured him, &quot;We can talk on English.&quot; She had changed outfits three times for this meeting, finally settling on a light, summery shirt with bluejeans and white high heels. It was casual but sexy. Yet she had the feeling he wasn't really looking at her. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth was that Mike had misplaced his eyeglasses. The woman across from him was a colorful blur with a pleasant scent. He loved listening to her voice. He smiled while she searched for words. She could butcher his language all she wanted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevena was a bit unclear about his occupation. He gave her his business card, and she went home to puzzle over what a &quot;grants procurement administrator&quot; might be. The dictionary said procure was &quot;to get and make available for promiscuous sexual intercourse.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike had told her that he worked for an American firm named Ronco, out of the American Cultural Center, which was true. He said Ronco supported the U.S. Agency for International Development by purchasing computers, fax machines and office supplies. That was the same thing he told the police. He couldn't tell her that Ronco administered USAID grants to Serbian opposition groups. Things were tense, and even Nevena, who was wholeheartedly against Milosevic and his Socialist Party of Serbia, was not immune to their nationalist rhetoric, which said that Serbs didn't need the Americans or anyone else to help them run their country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her own life, Nevena was fiercely independent. In 1998, she wasn't confronting the riot police, but neither was she toeing the party line. She bought antiques and old paintings, and she sold them out of her apartment. She bought apartments, too, lived in them while she spruced them up, then resold or rented them out. She made enough money to feel independent of the socialist system she despised. The last thing she wanted was to be a civil servant. They lined up at the bank every Friday to cash their paychecks, as if spending the workday in line hid the fact that they weren't productive and weren't expected to be. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before long, she was meeting Mike regularly for coffee and drinks. He was different from most people she knew, and not only because he told jokes in two languages. He talked about the future as if it were something that people created for themselves. The more time she spent with him, the more she realized that everyone around her treated the future as if it were something that was coming to crush them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was startled when he suddenly became critical of Serbs for accepting their powerless condition. Nevena didn't have the English to say that they had tried for years to change things. Anyone who spoke up was attacked, and Milosevic did what he wanted to anyway. How could she tell him what she barely admitted to herself? Her hopes had been dashed for so long that she'd practically given up and stopped caring. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mike told her that he was being transferred to Banja Luka, in Bosnia, she was surprised by how much the news saddened her. &quot;It's too far,&quot; she said. He told her it was only half an hour by plane, and he would pay for her to come every weekend. But Nevena felt like her life was returning to the way it had been before. Soon she'd again be like every other Serb in Belgrade, depressed and cynical. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike called from Banja Luka and pressed her to visit. Missing him terribly, she went. The war in Bosnia was long over, but when she drove there, she felt like she'd been ambushed. As a rainy nightfall overtook her, she came upon vast landscapes of rubble, and the sickening realization that these had been towns and villages. For three years, Croatia and Serbia had tried to rip Bosnia in half and share the spoils. Living in Belgrade, she'd been largely in the dark. She'd tuned out what little real news got through. It wasn't her war, she told herself. She couldn't change anything, and she had her own affairs to worry about. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now she saw charred beams, heaps of bricks, sticks of furniture, and a solitary plaster wall marred by bullets. The destruction stretched to the horizon on all sides. She shouted and wailed and drove through her tears. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dating grew even more complicated in February 1999, when Mike left Ronco and took a job with Freedom House in Sarajevo. Belgrade and Sarajevo are about as close geographically as Washington and Philadelphia, but in terms of goodwill they were more like Tel Aviv and Baghdad in 1999. There were no flights between the cities. Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia, after all, and the terror its residents had suffered at the hands of Serb soldiers was still a recent memory. There was a bus from Belgrade, but Serb drivers refused to go through Croat-Muslim territory and took a tortuously indirect route. To make matters worse, NATO, led by the United States, was threatening to bomb Serbia for its aggression in Kosovo, so it wasn't a good time for an American to visit Belgrade. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike felt like they were trying to weather a storm in a rickety lifeboat. If they could just keep bailing until the storm broke, they would survive. If they could stay together until he found a job in Belgrade, they would have a chance at a normal relationship. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They talked on the phone every night. He tried to focus on how they felt about each other, and how good it would be to be together again. But Nevena couldn't help talking politics. She felt that Serbs had been wronged by the world, and by NATO in particular. Mike held his tongue. He believed in peaceful solutions as a general rule, but he thought NATO should have bombed Serbia months ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 24, 1999, Nevena came home from her English class at 7:30 in the evening. Mike called from Sarajevo to warn her. The NATO bombing was beginning. She refused to believe it until the sirens began -- loud, terrifying and unceasing. She rushed through the apartment, dutifully preparing to evacuate. Then she realized there was nowhere to go. She sat down on her sofa in the dark and listened to the sirens wail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Nevena left Belgrade about four weeks later, she felt like she was abandoning her home, her family and her friends. But she recognized that she and Mike had to spend time together or give up completely. She boarded the bus to Sarajevo and suffered the next 12 hours on the war-weary back roads of Bosnia beside a woman with motion sickness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevena stayed for almost a month, despite their frequent arguments over the bombing and the occasional discomfort that went along with being a Serb in Sarajevo. At times she looked at Mike and thought they had a future together if only the world were not so crazy. Other times she couldn't stand the sight of him, like when he agreed with her that NATO shouldn't bomb Serbia's bridges and suggested that they bomb Serbia's soldiers instead. She wanted to go home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this was no time to break up. But what was he supposed to do? Insist that his girlfriend stay in Sarajevo until his country finished bombing hers? He respected her devotion to the place where she was born, even though it was taking her away from him. Standing on line to board the bus, she couldn't look at him. He pulled her out of line and embraced her. Then she boarded without looking back and he waved until the bus disappeared. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last bomb fell on June 10, 1999, after 78 days, with Milosevic still firmly in power. Mike drove to Belgrade while the ashes were still fresh. He was scared, knowing he could be arrested or attacked by an anti-American mob, but he couldn't stay away. Belgrade was like a patient waking up from radical treatment to find that the cancer remained. But Nevena allowed herself some hope for the future. If her country could survive the bombing, it could survive anything. And she was glad to see Mike. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stayed one extra day on business, meeting with the Serbian activists he knew from his days with Ronco. Back in Sarajevo, he told Freedom House that the Serbian opposition in Belgrade was frightened, isolated and uncertain about the future. For all these groups knew, they didn't have a friend in the world. He said that Belgrade was the one place in the Balkans where he could be most effective. Freedom House agreed, but everyone knew it was a dangerous assignment. The only Americans seen recently in Serbia had been prisoners of war and their negotiators. In 1998, Yugoslavia's deputy prime minister had told the nation that anyone working for an international aid organization deserved to be taken to the butcher and cut to pieces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next time Mike visited Belgrade, he went with Nevena to the Ministry of the Interior. On the third floor, there was a sign in English that read, &quot;Department of Strangers.&quot; There, an officer named Boris poked away at the keys of a manual typewriter. There are two ways to get residency, Boris said. You must register for Serbian language courses at the university or get married to a Serb. Mike said, &quot;I'm sick to death of learning languages.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the street outside, they talked about marriage as if they were considering purchasing a car. There was no denying it would enable them to spend more time together. They both wondered if there was enough love between them, but they were sick of being apart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the pretense of pragmatism, they grew excited over the following weeks. They were married in October 1999. The air was warm and the trees still held fast to their leaves. Mike and Nevena were aglow that morning, and not only because of rakija, the perfectly clear, wickedly strong and quintessentially Balkan plum brandy made and sold like moonshine. She wore a sleek white dress that stopped above her knees and black leather boots that stopped just below. Her blond hair swept her shoulders. He wore a navy suit, white shirt and yellow tie. She'd talked him into a more European hairstyle -- so short there was no combing it to the side. They were married before two seated bureaucrats. When Mike informed the bookkeeper that Nevena did not wish to take the name Staresinic, she tugged at his sleeve and whispered, &quot;Meeko! I've changed my mind.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't Ask, Don't Tell </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike and Nevena's commitment to each other required an extraordinary measure of trust. She knew what his job was, and that it was dangerous, but he didn't give her details. She didn't ask. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By November 1999, the word was out that Freedom House had money for &quot;elections related grant activity&quot; and that Mike Staresinic was the local contact. Around the same time, the police picked up a man named Slobodan Djinovic for questioning. He was one of the most important figures in the Serbian resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An officer scrolled through the names in Djinovic's mobile telephone and said, &quot;Who's Staresinic?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some guy I play basketball with,&quot; Djinovic lied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom House funded more than 40 proposals from Serbian opposition groups for around half a million dollars. They were not the sole or even the largest source of American support for the Serbian democracy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> USAID had a bigger budget and more American personnel working out of Hungary. But no other aid organization had anyone so immersed in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike had 3,000 German marks stashed in the apartment to pay for his emergency evacuation. He could get to Romania, Bulgaria or Bosnia within a few hours and cross the border like any traveler. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevena had several ovarian cysts removed that winter, and the doctor told her that if she wanted children, she should think about starting soon. Mike and Nevena were both surprised by how quickly they conceived. They talked about having the child in the United States, but Nevena refused to concede that the country of her birth might not be a safe place to have a baby. Besides, Milosevic had suddenly announced that the presidential election would be held in October, less than three months away. They couldn't leave now. She became an activist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early September 2000, Nevena was pulled over by the police for displaying a resistance sign in her car window. She got out of the car and challenged the officers. It was her car, she asserted. She could do what she wanted. They took the sign from her window and ripped it to pieces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senior officer said they'd let her go, but only because she was pregnant. No, she countered, if I committed a crime then arrest me. One officer pulled Nevena aside and said if they are telling you to go, then get out of here. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She drove a few blocks away and stopped the car. She was still shaking with fear and anger. She walked around to the back of the car and pulled out a fresh sign: a clenched white fist on a black background and the single word &quot;Otpor!&quot; Resistance! She taped it to the window. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten days before the election Mike was feeling extremely insecure. Freedom House was suggesting that he might want to get out. Local activists were getting arrested. Serbs who worked for aid organizations were fleeing the country. There was a meeting scheduled for that evening: Someone was returning Freedom House's grant money. The reasons weren't clear to Mike. It bugged him all day. Nobody returned grant money. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An hour before the meeting, it dawned on him there was only one possible reason for someone to schedule a time and place to put Freedom House money into his hands. He was being set up. He went straight to the flat, ran up one flight of stairs and let himself in. It was dark and muggy, but he left the lights off, windows shut and blinds drawn. They'd probably come straight there when he didn't show up for the meeting. He had to get out of town. Maybe for good. There were 120 proposals in two stacks. Why had he held on to this stuff? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He started tearing. Sweat streamed down his face. He'd never figured out how to find a paper shredder without attracting attention. He started mixing the shreds into two different trash bags. He urinated in the bags, poured in dish soap and beer, saving some to drink himself. It took more than an hour, and near the end he was certain there would be a fist pounding on the door at any moment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He left the bags in two different dumpsters. He walked a few blocks, turning corners and slipping down a narrow alley. He switched taxis to avoid being followed, then arrived at Nevena's sister's house, where he laid low for a few days until he and Nevena flew to Montenegro together. Nevena returned on a surprisingly quiet Sunday to vote. Mike shrugged off the danger and followed on Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By this time, entire towns in the Serbian provinces had been shut down in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations. In Belgrade, protesters filled the streets daily. At times the city was jubilant. The people in the streets knew Milosevic had lost. They only had to make him admit it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevena demonstrated every day, and never considered leaving Belgrade for the safety of the child she carried. &quot;It's boiling here,&quot; she said, as if that were the most wonderful thing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Birth of a Nation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, October 4, Nevena slept off the previous day's march. When she finally emerged from the bedroom, the coffeepot was cold. Mike and his green mug were gone. By noon, she could already hear the music and the voices coming from the square through her kitchen window. She ate a little lunch and went to join the protesters gathering in the square. People sang and waved banners as they marched. Whenever someone shouted Slobo's name, an inarticulate roar of defiance rose up and the buildings seemed to shake. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From far across the square, she saw a few men on the balcony of Mike's office flat. Immediately, she was concerned. She pulled out her mobile and called him. No answer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the flat, Mike stood sullenly and listened to the crowd outside. His arms were twisted painfully in front of him and locked into position with handcuffs. Clearly the police had known about the flat for some time. They had taken him here to look for evidence of anti-government activity. Ludicrous. Most of the country was involved in anti-government activity. All they had to do was look out the window. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike had already been strip-searched at the station. Standard humiliation, but he knew this was serious trouble. He estimated his chances of successfully rushing the balcony and vaulting the rail into the crowded street below. He wasn't sure he could get past the guys on the balcony. Even if he did, there would still be the danger of getting shot on the way down or breaking both ankles when he hit the pavement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the police officers looked at him and said, &quot;Mike, you might be the last victim of communism in Yugoslavia.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevena had an appointment with her doctor at 4 to check on the progress of her pregnancy. One moment she was singing for the president to kill himself. The next she was stroking her belly with one hand and talking to her baby. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctor said she and the baby were in perfect health. She had only been home 10 minutes when the doorbell rang. &quot;Who is it?&quot; she called. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mike.&quot; But the voice was wrong. So flat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She opened the door. There must have been 12 officers with him. She looked to him for an explanation, but it was clear he was not allowed to speak. They all came inside and an officer told her they would be searching the apartment. He asked, &quot;Do you know what Freedom House is?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She didn't even look at Mike. She knew what she was supposed to say. &quot;No.&quot; But she cried immediately, and they did not ask her any more questions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They conducted a painstaking search. They confiscated two computers, dozens of rolls of exposed film, two cameras, and the German marks Mike had set aside for emergency evacuation. One officer videotaped the entire search and Mike imagined it airing as propaganda on state TV -- American imperialists attempted to steal the election, but President Milosevic has successfully defended Serbia's independence! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers were cautious around Nevena. She was a Serb after all, and pregnant. She asked them to promise they wouldn't hurt him. Please don't hit him, she repeated. But she had to be herself, and when they discovered Mike's homemade replica of an opposition poster, she asked the officers, &quot;Do you know why Milosevic is yellow in that picture?&quot; They did not. &quot;Because he's dead. And only you don't know it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike had never seen her so strong. He'd never realized how much he needed her and trusted her. She'd never realized how devoted to him she was. They allowed her to fix a sandwich and a tall glass of rakija for him. After he ate, she sat on his lap with officers so close on either side that they could all hear one another breathe. She was never so proud of him. Her makeup was running down her cheeks when they embraced and said goodbye. He whispered to her, &quot;Call the world.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She started with the office of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia next door. She told them Mike Staresinic was being arrested and they must send someone outside immediately to witness. She grabbed her little camera, ran to the balcony and snapped a picture as they led him away. At the sight of the flash, two officers instantly pounded back up the stairs. One officer snatched the camera from her hands and yelled that she should show more respect after they'd treated her so carefully. Hours later, Mike was alone in a sparse and windowless interrogation room. He lifted his head from the table when an officer opened the door and said, &quot;Hey! Let's go!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are leaving Serbia.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He didn't believe them. It must have been past 10 in the evening. There was one enforcer in back with him, and another in front with the driver. They took Brotherhood and Unity Highway out of town, past the spot where Nevena had stared down the police only the day before. Mike thought it would be smart to leave as much DNA evidence in the car as possible. He pulled off pieces of fingernail and wiped his sweat on the upholstery. Their headlights cut through a black and featureless countryside between Belgrade and Croatia, and the driver made a call. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;we'll be there in 20 minutes.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They got out of the car and brought Mike to the edge of the darkness, then told him to walk. The Croatian border was 300 yards away along a deserted road. Before turning his back, Mike offered his hand to the officer in charge and looked him in the eye for a moment. &quot;For correct work,&quot; he said in Serbian, &quot;thank you.&quot; &quot;In other words,&quot; Mike would tell me later, &quot;thanks for not leaving me in a ditch.&quot; When Nevena received Mike's call from Croatia, she couldn't believe it. She made him hang up and call back, and when he did she shouted for joy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 5, 2000, the people took over Belgrade's parliament building while my brother watched on television from a hotel on the Croatian border. The next day, Slobodan Milosevic would admit he had lost the election and resign. After all Mike had been through, he was glad to be gone from Serbia. It would be a long time before his nerves returned to normal, but he felt a measure of safety for the first time in months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet it was strange to be so far away when the streets of Belgrade erupted into spontaneous celebration. He'd imagined the moment so many times, but he never thought he'd be alone when it happened. They'd stamped his passport in red, &quot;Banned from entry to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for five years.&quot; It would take weeks to get a new passport and visa. In the meantime, Mike and Nevena would spend their first wedding anniversary apart. Her doctor forbade her to travel, and Mike was not able to return to Belgrade until late November. But that was soon enough. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 6, 2001, a boy named Isaac Mateja Staresinic was born to loving parents in a liberated Belgrade. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chuck Staresinic is a graduate student of creative writing at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/body&gt; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revolution will not be led. But it will be mentored.  &Acirc;&para;  We're in a conference room at New York University with about four dozen slightly starstruck activists, artists, students and professors. A couple young people fromhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/occupy-wall-street-nypd-to-look-into-officers-use-of-pepper-spray-on-protestors/2011/09/28/gIQAm3S04K_blog.htmlhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/wall-street-protesters-hope-to-plant-seeds-of-a-national-cause/2011/10/03/gIQAiBmKJL_story.htmlOccupy Wall Street have temporarily left the occupation to be here. A leader of the frolicsome 1990s student uprising against Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevicis present. &Acirc;&para; The Yes Labis in session - presided over by the Yes Men, the dynamic prankster art duo who specialize in impersonating corporate lackeys and fooling journalists. &Acirc;&para; Stripped of their spoofy personas and pinstripe suits from the Salvation Army on Fourth Avenue, the Yes Men are winsomely sheepish. Jacques Servin, 48, is unshaven in an untucked button-down shirt. Igor Vamos, 43, wears a T-shirt from a Tunisian graffiti artist that says, in Arabic, &quot;Need My History.&quot; &Acirc;&para; Never mind the slogan of their 2009 documentary, &quot;The Yes Men Fix the World&quot; - &quot;Sometimes it takes a lie to expose the truth.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today the Yes Men promise to tell the truth. Expose merry tricks of satiric political activism. Invite us behind the scenes of the street theater. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And something more: On their latest and craziest mission of all, the Yes Men propose to catch the new creative spark of revolution - from Tunisia to Wall Street to Washington - and coach it into bigger headlines and better buzz. Like radical Johnny Appleseeds, their goal is to sow the land with scores of activists schooled in how to practice what Servin calls &quot;using humor to attack the powerful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll first do a full group brainstorm for Occupy Wall Street and come up with a list of actions they can do to enjoy themselves and keep themselves busy,&quot; Servin tells the lab participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Folks around the table riff on possible slogans and stunts. The occupiers seem to like what they hear, and take notes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a danger of over-thinking,&quot; Servin counsels. &quot;It's more important to do something and enjoy it and have fun and meet people and get the word out there by any stupid means possible. And just do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He speaks from experience. Famous in left-wing activist circles, the Yes Men periodically break into mainstream consciousness with comic book hero flair - the Yes Men strike again!<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Punk the Establishment</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their most celebrated stunt, in 2004, Servin was interviewed on BBC World posing as a spokesman for Dow Chemical. He announced that Dow would take responsibility for the deadly 1984 Bhopal chemical spill and pay $12 billion to survivors. Dow was forced to respond it would do no such thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2009, the Yes Men and environmentalists staged a press conferencein the name of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the National Press Club in Washington. Servin announced that the chamber had suddenly decided to support tough climate change legislation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this way, the Yes Men take credit for sparking hundreds of newspaper and television stories over the last decade on issues that the Yes Men say would not have received as much coverage if not for the media catnip of their stunts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics say the Yes Men are merely con artists and publicity hounds. The chamber filed a lawsuit accusing them of &quot;commercial identity theft masquerading as social activism.&quot; They've never been criminally charged for a stunt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The art world gingerly embraces them, and the progressive activist community hails them for re-energizing the anti-corporate, pro-powerless causes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We crave Yes Men-style activism,&quot; says Justin Wedes, 25, a part-time public high school teacher in New York, who works with Occupy Wall Street and who was advised by the Yes Men this past spring when his group, US Uncut, perpetrated the hoax claiming General Electric would return a $3.2 billion tax refund. &quot;There's a certain sense of frustration and powerlessness in protest actions today. You don't feel like you're reaching anyone.&quot; (GE says it received no refund but paid lower taxes because of business losses.)<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Yes Men on campus</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, after a career of infiltrating institutions and videotaping the results, the Yes Men have gained admittance to the ivory tower without any subterfuge at all. Servin is stepping into the real role of &quot;visiting associate arts professor&quot; in the performance studies department at NYU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today's seven-hour workshop is the opening session of the Yes Lab, a weekly extracurricular practicum where activists will hatch Yes Men-inspired protest stunts, and then go out and do them. The theme for the first batch of actions in the coming months will be the problem of income disparity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Servin and Vamos have been professors before. Servin taught at Parsons the New School for Design, and Vamos is on the art faculty of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Next semester at NYU, Servin will teach a graduate seminar on revolution and an undergraduate course on &quot;the design principles for activism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's novel is the Yes Lab, which formalizes and institutionalizes theirmentoring of young activists.It's just one notable new example of seasoned left-wing activists systematically trying to propagate a creative, arts-inflected style of subversion. Several groups, including the Yes Men, are collaborating on&quot;Beautiful Trouble: Toolbox for the Next Revolution,&quot;a printed manual and Web site .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yes Lab is housed at the NYU-supported Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, a consortium of universities in Latin and North America exploring the crossroads of art, activism and scholarship. Servin is also curating a weekly lecture serieson &quot;creative activism.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYU administrators draw a distinction between Servin's academic perch as a professor and the edgier pursuits of the Yes Lab. The Yes Lab is not in the university curriculum, is not supported with tuition money and is open to pretty much anyone inside or outside the university. The lab is chartered as a non-profit to raise its own funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People can choose to participate in the Yes Lab but it's nobody's job or obligation or course work to participate,&quot; says Diana Taylor, founding director of the institute. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">'Who are you really, sir?'</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Servin and Vamos each had grandfathers who were killed in the Holocaust - family histories, they say, that form a root of their mistrust of authority and sensitivity to what they consider official propaganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Servin grew up in Tucson; Vamos near Albany, N.Y. They met in the mid-1990s at the behest of mutual friends after each had gained underground notoriety for a stunt: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working as a computer game programmer, Servin buried rogue code in the SimCopter game so that scantily clad men would suddenly appear and start kissing wildly. Thousands of doctored games were shipped; Servin was fired. Vamos and some cohorts switched the vocal packages of talking Barbies with those of talking G.I. Joe dolls, and put them back on store shelves, leading to a rash of confused children being interviewed on television. Their Barbies said things such as &quot;Vengeance is mine.&quot; The G.I. Joes said, &quot;It's so much fun to shop with you.&quot; In interviews at the time, Vamos and his cohorts said the prank was a critique of gender stereotyping and violence inherent in toys. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Servin and Vamos created a techno activist art project that made it into the Whitney Biennial in 2000, using invented corporate-style Web sites and press releases to proclaim the existence of a secret network of pranksters embedded across corporate America. The Yes Men were born when, after further experiments with fake Web sites, they were surprised that some journalists and officials took the Web sites seriously, clicked on &quot;contact,&quot; and sought interview subjects and speakers. The Yes Men obliged these requests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their real names sound like aliases, so as the Yes Men they devised the more &quot;normal&quot; monikers Andy Bichlbaum (Servin) and Mike Bonanno (Vamos). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2004 romp on BBC http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34057-2004Dec3.htmlprompted the world media to put the debate over corporate responsibility in the news on the 20th anniversary of the disaster at a Union Carbide pesticide plant that killed thousands. (Carbide had paid $470 million to the Indian government. Dow later acquired Carbide. The Bhopal site remains contaminated and survivors say they are sick.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The BBC declined to comment for this story; Dow did not respond to several requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, the Yes Men have talked gibberish on behalf of the World Trade Organization; distributed candles they said were prototypes made by Exxon to recycle the body fat of victims of climate change; and demonstrated the bogus SurvivaBall spherical body suit they said was created by Halliburton to allow a person to withstand any disaster. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the fake 2009 Chamber of Commerce news conference - attended by real reporters, including one from The Washington Post - Servin posed as the fictional spokesman &quot;Hingo Sembra.&quot; A real chamber official burst into the room and created a scene that guaranteed widespread, snickering media coverage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a fraudulent press activity and a stunt,&quot; said the real chamber official, Eric Wohlschlegel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who are you really, sir?&quot; asked Sembra/Servin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I work there, and you do not look familiar to me at all,&quot; Wohlschlegel said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't barge in here and interrupt our press conference,&quot; Sembra/Servin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a fraud! He's lying!&quot; Wohlschlegel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chamber declined to comment for this story. In a brief supporting the 2009 lawsuit, still pending in U.S. District Court in Washington, the chamber's lawyers wrote: &quot;Jacques Servin and Igor Vamos are con artists who have operated under many aliases to perpetrate their schemes. They characterize their business as 'identity correction' - posing as other persons for the purpose of misrepresenting their positions to the public. This is just another way to say 'identity theft.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yes Men's pro bono legal team, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, responded that the stunt was constitutionally protected parody and political speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critics sometimes see the humor but not the point. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Candles made from human bodies? It was grotesque; at least it was funny. But there again, what's the point?&quot; says Marlo Lewis Jr., senior fellow on energy and environmental policy at the free-market-advocatingCompetitive Enterprise Institute, who has a cameo in &quot;The Yes Men Fix the World.&quot; &quot;They're pretty good at self-promotion. How have they advanced public understanding of any issue?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite their reliance on deception, Servin and Vamos say they never allow a lie to linger. The Dow, Chamber and GE hoaxes were revealed in less than an hour. The point, they say, is never the lie; the point is the momentary disoriented pause when - they hope - reporters and the public will ask, What if the lie were true?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's keeping the ideas alive that things can be different, and that there's something dramatically wrong with the world,&quot; Servin says. &quot;So that when change is possible, those ideas are there. And now is a time when change is really possible.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young activists see them as role models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They make me feel like any of these big issues will be able to be fixed with a positive outlook and a creative approach,&quot; says Jessica Assaf, 21, a senior at NYU majoring in public health and social activism, who worked with the Yes Men on a recent project to place official-looking stickers on water fountains in New York saying, &quot;This water is most likely safe,&quot; as part of an anti-fracking campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month Servin gave a guest-artist lecture at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, where he urged the students: &quot;Figure out how you really might want to change the world, and don't worry about the [art] gallery.&quot; <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">With BFF's like these . . . </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in the Yes Lab, Servin gives a brief illustrated tour of the history of political pranktivism, from Abbie Hoffman throwing money in the New York Stock Exchange to Iraq Veterans Against the Warperforming a mock &quot;patrol&quot;through downtownD.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivan Marovic, a former leader of the Otpor </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> youth </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Serbia, discusses the role of art and humor in creating &quot;dilemma actions,&quot; where no matter how the authorities react, they look ridiculous or worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lab participants divide into working groups to focus on issues within the theme of income disparity, including corporate tax avoidance, military spending and immigration. The working groups report back with possible stunts, which the larger group critiques.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the Nato bombing campaign ended, there was little for the young people of Serbia to celebrate. Having endured 12 years of Milosevic's reign, a decade of wars, economic meltdown and international pariah status, they found themselves with no money, no prospects and nowhere to go. Janine di Giovanni meets the lost youth of Belgrade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ilooked everywhere, but Aleksandra was gone. At the apartment she despised - a twelfth-floor communist-style block in Yugoslavia's New Belgrade - the phone rang into dead space. The mobile that she carried with her like a spare limb was disconnected: a voice in Serbo-Croat sternly informed me the person had abandoned the number. The crowded coffee bar that blasted Puff Daddy was strangely quiet without her: the bartender said he hadn't seen her for weeks. Maria, a mutual friend, wasn't surprised. &quot;If she had a chance to get out of Belgrade, she would have taken it,&quot; she said. &quot;She probably got a visa and jumped in the first car and drove to Hungary. Maybe she got a break.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aleks needed a lucky break. When I met her in the summer of last year she was 22, an archaeology student who had abandoned her studies during the Nato war because her thesis - the restoration of Orthodox churches in Kosovo - became obsolete. The bombing campaign against her city had just ended, but she and her friends weren't celebrating. Instead, the end of the war signalled something more terrifying to them: a black hole of a future, with no prospects and no dreams. They had no money. They had no visas to travel - being Serbs, it was impossible to get a visa to enter any civilised country (the Serbs' only friends are the Iraqis, Libyans and Chinese) and even if they could wangle one, they needed the money to get to Hungary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The war in Kosovo forced most Western countries to close their embassies in Belgrade. Now they can't even bury themselves in studies. Most classes in their universities have been halted since the war: those that have re-started are hopelessly overcrowded. And with university professors earning about $ 100 a month, it makes more sense for them to become black marketeers and sell illegal gasoline in plastic Coke bottles or Bulgarian cigarettes on street corners. If you have links to the Government, you can make thousands, so why earn an honest living? &quot;I really feel for these kids,&quot; says Stasa Babic, a professor of philosophy at Belgrade University. &quot;They have no prospects. They really are a lost generation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last June, a few days after the Yugoslav federal parliament voted to lift the official state of war, a Belgrade-based economic think tank called G-17 published the cheerful news that in 40 years time, the economy would be back to its 1989 pre-war state. In 1999, the GDP was 44.4 per cent lower than 1998 because of the war, and the damage caused by Nato was estimated at Pounds 17.4 million. This news was published in Blic, one of the few newspapers that doesn't toe the government line. That day, Ana, Aleksandra's best friend, read the news out loud and dropped her head in her hands in despair. She said that according to her grandmother, it took Belgrade 30 years to get back on its feet after the Second World War. &quot;I don't want to wait 30 years to have a normal life,&quot; she said. And for the moment these kids - the Milosevic generation - do not have normal lives. In a sense, they are the American equivalent of slackers. They don't quite see the point of wasting their time planning for the future or trying to work hard. The only role models they have, the only people doing well in Belgrade, are gangsters with thick necks and bimbo girlfriends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aleks's friends seem to spend most of their time in coffee bars, inventing elaborate visions of escape or working as translators for the few foreigners who come to Belgrade. The only one with a job is Ivan, who desperately wants to finish his degree, but has to work to support his family after his father was killed by a hit-and-run driver on the highway to Montenegro. Ivan drags himself off to a job at a graphic-design firm for $ 100 a month. Even Aleks's brother, Dragan, who is 18 and has every reason to look forward to life, seems to move through his days with an air of resigned defeat: he pores over Will Smith MTV videos and talks endlessly of going to America to play professional basketball. &quot;I can't make it here,&quot; he says. &quot;Only the children of the political elite manage to get ahead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is what I call 'Futureless in Belgrade',&quot; Aleksandra once told me. &quot;Something like Sleepless in Seattle, but without the jokes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Far worse than their immediate future is the terrible lingering sense of failure left over from the loss of four wars. This generation, now in their twenties, who have survived the 12-year reign of Slobodan Milosevic, have known nothing but a decade of economic meltdown, losses, dead soldiers, sanctions, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations and gloom. And, politically, they are confused. While they don't actively oppose the current regime - very few of the ones I meet are out marching on the streets to topple Milosevic - they try to question exactly what has happened to their country, but get caught up in their own Serb victimisation: &quot;The world is against us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1990, when Tito died and the first of Yugoslavia's wars began - the one against Slovenian succession - the country was just poised to move closer to the West. As young teenagers, they had a tantalising taste of modern society, and then, suddenly and terribly, it was snatched from them. Now they don't know what to believe. Did Serb soldiers commit atrocities in Kosovo? Aleks didn't want to think about it because her own young friends were forced to serve in the province during the war. One came back so shell-shocked by what he saw that he had a breakdown and is now in hospital. &quot;I don't want to think of my people doing things like that,&quot; she said. &quot;It can't be possible. A lot of it is propaganda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are three viable options for the Milosevic generation: to join the criminal underworld where one at least can earn a decent living; to live in gloom; or to emigrate. Since 1990, estimates of the number of university-trained young people who have fled the city range from about 100,000 to 300,000 - a major brain drain. In 1991, only about 622,000 people in a population of 10 million had more than a secondary-school education. All those talented engineers, mathematicians and scientists, as well as writers, actors and artists, are high-tailing it to Germany, to France, to any country that will take them. &quot;Emigration is always hanging over my head,&quot; said Aleksandra sombrely. She counted off the number of lucky friends who got away: one, two, three, four, five... &quot;No, it's too depressing. Everyone's gone away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortly before the Solidarity </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Poland, Rolling Stone reporter P.J. O'Rourke went to Warsaw to observe the lives of young Poles. He came to this conclusion: &quot;Living in Poland,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is like living with your parents. Forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's the same thing with Belgrade - in fact, most Serbs between the ages of 18 and 30 do live with their parents. Before the wars began, Belgrade was the coolest place in the former Yugoslavia - in fact, in most of Eastern Europe. Czechs, Hungarians, Russians and Romanians drifted to the White City on the Danube because of its intellectual ambience: it was a bit like Paris in the Twenties. Film-makers like Goran Paskaljevic (The Powder Keg) and Srdjan Dragojevic (Pretty Villages, Pretty Flames) hung out at the National Theatre. Writers like Vladimir Arsenijevic (In the Hold) wrote about young Serbs and their loves and lives. Musicians, artists, dancers, intellectuals and free-thinkers migrated to the excellent restaurants - Serbs love their food - and all-night clubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All that has changed. Now it is cool to be a gangster, not a thinker, and the city is divided neatly in two: those who have money - which means it probably came from some dodgy place and therefore they are probably connected to the Milosevic regime - and those who do not. Those who do not, still struggle to get on with life, but it is a struggle. They are a lost generation, but without champagne cocktails and glamour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, they try. &quot;This is what we do: we come home after work, if we work, and then take a nap,&quot; says Marija, who is studying international law, but who lost a year because she fled to Montenegro when the bombing started. &quot;Then we eat dinner and go out around midnight. Everyone stays out until six or seven and then goes to breakfast, then goes to work...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No one goes to work,&quot; interrupts her friend Ilisa. &quot;No one has any work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Yeah, that's right, I forgot,&quot; Marija says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It seems like there isn't a problem at first glance. Then when you talk to people, you realise thereis a common thread: nearly everyone spends all the money they have on bars and clubs; no one is getting married or having children and no one is talk-ing about what they want to do when they grow up. There's no flash &quot;I want to work in the city&quot; or &quot;I want to be the next Richard Branson&quot; talk. There's just the constant thud of music, drugs coming from Albania and Turkey, and lots of drink to ease the pain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Katerina, who is 19, meets me in The Sports Cafe which has re-opened after being closed for several weeks by &quot;the financial police&quot;. &quot;Don't ask why,&quot; she says. She tells me that she is in her first year at university, studying graphic engineering, but doesn't see the point of going to classes. &quot;Now they hold them in old cinemas downtown because there are so many people,&quot; she says. &quot;We share seats and have to write with our notebooks on our knees. A lot of refugees from Kosovo are there. The Government is embarrassed, so they let them in without taking exams.&quot; A jumped-up version of the Verve's Bitter Sweet Symphony blares out of the speakers and Katerina silently mouths the words. She looks thoughtful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Since the bombing,&quot; she says, studying the menu of bad American-style food, none of which she can afford, &quot;my life is going down. My father is a printer. He works two jobs, so I never see him. My mother works as a music teacher and not many people want music lessons any more. But the worst thing is psychological. Since the bombing, nothing surprises me any more. I'm ready for anything. My country is sinking, but since we've touched bottom, where else is there to go?&quot; She says that she will go the first chance she has: once she has money, once she can scam a visa. At the moment, her mother gives her DM50 (Pounds 15) a month to live on while she is studying: a pair of imported shoes costs DM100, a cup of tea in a cafe DM1. It is this kind of stagnation that is forcing her to think about leaving and never coming back. &quot;My parents taught me not to be emotionally connected to anything that cannot survive,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The answer to all this angst is to numb the pain. Katerina doesn't have a boyfriend (&quot;What's the point? No one is getting married any more&quot;) so she goes out every night with friends to places where she can order one drink and linger a long time. Men pay DM1.5 to enter the clubs; women get in free and they can usually get someone to buy them a glass of vodka for DM2.5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At 2 o'clock in the morning, Reseva (the name means monastery), a club in Central Belgrade, is heaving with sweaty bodies swaying to the Pan Band doing a cover of Born to be Wild. Everyone may be out of work, but the beer and tequila slammers are flowing and there is so much smoke from imitation Marlboros that tears run down my cheeks. Beautiful girls with long blonde hair and tattoos on their bare shoulders are gyrating; guys in surfer T-shirts and Levi's roll joints and pass them around. It could be fraternity night at an American campus, or a club in the West End, but when you scratch the surface, you see kids who are terrified of the future. &quot;What future?&quot; screams Elizabetta - who was studying computers in &quot;her old life&quot; before the war - over the din. It surprises me that she knows all the words to the Doors' LA Woman, and My Sharona by the Knack. &quot;Why shouldn't I?&quot; she says defensively. &quot;What do you think I did in high school? Listened to the Doors, just like you did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At 26, like many young Serbs, Elizabetta is tall and heart-stoppingly beautiful. But she is scarred, and in ten days I saw her laugh only once, at the cinema. As a Serb resident of Sarajevo, she was evacuated by her parents with her little brother in 1992. She expected to be gone for a week; instead she found herself in exile. As a result of the four lost wars, there are nearly half a million internally displaced people - Serbs who originally lived in Bosnia, Croatia or Kosovo - now scattered throughout the country. It is fair to say that the refugees are treated like second-class citizens - they are living proof of the failed wars, and an embarrassment to the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elizabetta carries a card in her wallet which defines her as a non-resident of Belgrade, even though she is a Serb. It is a constant reminder that she is a refugee: but while she should feel she is among her own people, she never does. When I ask her why she doesn't go home, she looks startled: &quot;To what?&quot; she says. &quot;There's nothing left in Sarajevo - hardly any Serbs; most of my friends are gone; my house is gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She is spending most of her energy trying to get a visa to go to Italy, where her best friend is living. &quot;I could take the train,&quot; she says, &quot;cross Croatia, cross Slovenia... and vroom! I'd be somewhere sunny and warm. Somewhere with a life.&quot; Until then, she fantasises: she spends most of her time going to the cinema to see American romantic comedies at the Dom Omladine (House of Youth) on Friday nights, a cavernous place with hard-backed seats and a room packed with pool tables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her dream is not of finishing her degree and getting a job, but of bumping into Joseph Fiennes. For a young woman who was always first in her class, studying is not a way out. She gave up going to Belgrade University Faculty of Maths because there are ten computers for 800 students. The computers are loaded with software seven years old. The unheated hallways are packed with sniffling students elbowing each other to get a seat for a lecture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As in the old communist days, they queue up and wait with grim resignation. Everything is crowded in Belgrade: the police station where refugees like Elizabetta must come once a month to register; the shops which sell cheap Chinese clothes or stolen Italian goods which have been smuggled in by stewardesses on JAT Airlines; the corner stores that run out of bread by 8am; and, of course, the life force of the city, the bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is clear how little work gets done by the number of people whiling away the hours in cafes and bars during the day. In Stupidca, attached to the National Theatre where Closer is showing starring Branka Katic, a young Serb who also starred in the BBC drama Warriors, writers, directors and theatre people hang out for hours over espressos, discussing the script they are going to write, the project they are trying to get off the ground, or the Berlin or Cannes film festivals that they can't get visas to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The walls are lined with photographs of a naked blonde teenager, a Claudia Schiffer lookalike who works at a bar down the street. Her pouting face, bare bottom and adolescent breasts stare down at us. &quot;She comes here a lot,&quot; says one of the directors, staring at a photo of the teenager with her hands down her trousers in a faux-masturbation pose. &quot;Doesn't she feel uncomfortable when she comes in here and everyone sees her naked?&quot; I ask. Someone called Alex, a former theatre manager now working for French television, sighs. &quot;She thinks maybe some model agent from outside will see them and take her away and make her a star.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The truth is a model scout could never get a visa to get into Belgrade, and it is doubtful that the pretty teenager will ever get out of here. The most she can hope for is to use her beauty to lure either one of the few foreigners who come to Belgrade to take her away, or attract a gangster boyfriend. The latter is the easiest, as Belgrade is ripe with thugs carrying the three Bs - beeper, Beretta and babes. Their girlfriends, often as young as 15 or 16, are known as &quot;sponsor girls&quot;, which is something like being a geisha girl in Japan but without the charm and cultural history. They are middle-class high-school girls happy to trade their beautiful bodies for a bit of comfort from a skinhead thug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there are rewards. You can play tennis at a club. You get to go to expensive restaurants sucn as Villa, Frans, Mali Porto or Soho Bar, and carry stylish little silver Nokia phones. In the summer, you go swimming in the sea off the Montenegrin coast. Even under sanctions, life isn't too bad for a sponsor girl. That is, until they are replaced by someone younger. The sad truth is, you don't get ahead, you don't get rich by being hard-working in Belgrade. And everyone knows it. Says Katerina: &quot;Maybe sponsor girls aren't so stupid. Someone takes care of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Wanna go shopping?&quot; Angela asks. Angela is 24 and wealthy. She grew up abroad, is fluent in several languages and her parents have money stashed outside Yugoslavia. She has a car, a patent-leather wallet from Prada in Rome, and the option to get out of the country whenever she wants. Don't ask how. Shopping in Belgrade is not like shopping anywhere else in the world. First, Angela makes a few calls on her mobile (bill paid for by daddy). Then we meet on a downtown corner and drive to the old part of town. &quot;My friend just got four Prada bags,&quot; she says mysteriously. &quot;How?&quot; No reply. She turns the radio up in the car and we park and enter a walled house. We knock, an armed guard nods and lets us in. A smiling blonde in tight trousers and red lipstick invites us into her sitting room which has racks of one-off extremely expensive designer clothes: Armani, Alberta Ferretti, Marni, Ungaro, plus a few fur coats. Men's suits and shoes are piled in her bedroom. Where it all comes from, one can only guess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angela tries on a Moschino gown and decides she doesn't like it. Maybe a MaxMara cashmere overcoat in black? &quot;Check back next week,&quot; says the woman, disappointed that we didn't fork over hundreds of marks. &quot;I've got new stuff coming from Milan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next stop is a lingerie boutique run out of a thug's home. Boxes upon boxes of the gaspingly expensive Italian lingerie, La Perla (average cost for a bra in England, Pounds 125; average cost here on the black market, Pounds 20), are arranged in his spare bedroom. Frantic girls change in the bathroom alongside his bottles of cheap aftershave and dirty towels; he sits behind a desk and takes the hard cash - marks only. I don't see his gun, but I know he has one. He must have close to Pounds 1 million worth of underwear in his spare bedroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Let's hit the bars,&quot; Angela says, looking at her watch. It's about 5pm - time for a reviving cocktail before the nap that will allow us to continue on into the night. We go to KGB, one of the hippest rendezvous in Belgrade, where Nina, 25, is coming off a double shift at the state-run radio station where she works as a DJ. Her eyes are ringed with black circles: her hands shake with exhaustion as she lights a cigarette. She does shifts five times a week and gets DM80 a month. She orders a beer and tells me how much life sucks. &quot;A good lipstick costs DM20. A CD costs DM23,&quot; she says. &quot;I can't afford that, and I've been working for the station for five years. And I still live with my parents. Your life is supposed to improve as you get older. Mine just seems to get harder.&quot; She was 14 when the wars started. She remembers because her family had a house in Dubrovnik where they went every summer. &quot;One day, we just stopped going and Dubrovnik ceased to exist for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nina and her friends have inherited a Serb sense of victimisation - the ingrained certainty that the world is against them. But in many ways, she has a point. &quot;Young people here are lost in space,&quot; she says. &quot;Everyone wants to get out of here. Everyone wants to leave and never come back. The only reason I stay is because of the graves of my ancestors.&quot; Also, she adds, who would take her? &quot;When you show your passport, and people know you're a Serb, people resent and hate you... the world hates us. And here, the truth about the world is blocked - the censorship is so strong that we never know what is real and what are lies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her boyfriend, Dan, is one of the most popular rock stars in Serbia. He worships Brian Eno and Bono, both of whom have shown great interest in Yugoslavia. Dan's lived for years in America and England, but his songs focus on love and general Nirvana-like angst, Serb-style, rather than Bob Dylan-style politics. This is deliberate. Dan says part of the problem is that the youth of Serbia &quot;don't know the language of rebellion. It's not like punk in England, where a generation rose up and protested - here, young people are still sleeping. They feel, but they don't know how to show it. They're angry, but they don't know how to use their power. It's a question of time when this (Milosevic) regime topples, but they aren't doing anything valuable to help shift things. They're lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nina and Dan marched in the winter 1996 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrations. Then, everyone felt there was a chance to topple Milosevic. Now, the bombing campaign appears to have made him stronger than ever, uniting the Serbs with their victimisation. Neither Dan nor Tina attended any of the political opposition's recent demonstrations, which, because of poor attendance, have been reduced to Saturday marches. &quot;In 1996, all the clever people were on the streets trying to change the world,&quot; says Dan. &quot;Now they are all sleeping. They lost hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These politicians have got to go,&quot; agrees Nina. But she says she won't support the Milosevic political opposition, the Alliance for Change. &quot;I have enough troubles,&quot; she says. &quot;And, besides, I worked every day and every night of the bombing. We're too busy surviving to try to overthrow a government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After ten days in Belgrade, I discover what happened to my friend Aleksandra. In the space of about a month, she met a foreigner, got married and got out of Yugoslavia. I always knew she had something special. I used to think that had she not been born in Yugoslavia in 1977, she would have been bound for great things. The marriage shocked me. When I first heard the news, my stomach sank. What happened to all of her dreams of graduate school, of work, of travel? Then I thought of her sad, hungover face when she described being &quot;Futureless in Belgrade&quot;. Maybe it's not the best move, getting married at 22, but at least she got away.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. Keeping Peace - and Authority<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak. As some earlier speakers did, I would also like to start with semantics about peacekeeping, peacemaking, and peacebuilding. I do not subscribe to the idea of an overarching notion of peacekeeping that would extend even to operations such as the Gulf War. Furthermore, I am fairly certain that peacekeeping units would not be happy with this perception either, because they often have explained their action or inaction in terms of limitations inherent in the concept of peacekeeping. I think that their explanations are entitled to some respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I was somewhat puzzled with the sequence of this conference's topics. It began with peacekeeping and then moved towards peacemaking. While logic cannot offer much support to this sequence, it is precisely the order that was attempted in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The international community began to address the conflict first with peacekeeping, hoping that this would later yield peacemaking. It may seem rather easy to demonstrate the logical inconsistency of this progression, but a closer examination of the concepts of peacekeeping and peacemaking reveals that things are not so simple. These concepts are interlocking notions which involve different levels of reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The role of peacekeeping, like many other roles in the former Yugoslavia, was a transfunctional one. Peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, and in the former Yugoslavia in general, were always called &quot;peacekeeping,&quot; but they were clearly awaited as peacemaking forces. This was not merely wishful thinking on the part of Bosnians or other aggrieved residents of the former Yugoslavia. The problem was how to make peace, and the mission was heralded as a solution to the problem. There was a tremendous pressure to do something to stop the war, the atrocities, and ethnic cleansing, and the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was a response to this pressure. Political leaders in various countries explained to their voters that UNPROFOR was the means by which something would finally be &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*702]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  done, and it was clearly understood that making peace was what UNPROFOR would attempt to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the peacekeepers arrived, it became obvious that their mandate, their equipment, and their logistic support seriously restricted them. Still, they had one asset which seemed to proffer them some chance of success. This asset was their prestige, their authority. It was the first time in Eastern Europe that such a move was made. The &quot;international community&quot; stepped in, and I think that it was not a completely foolish expectation to believe that the arrival of U.N. troops would keep some ambitions at bay and possibly check aggression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bringing into play authority in Bosnia was not a completely new gambit. This has been the general approach towards events in Yugoslavia. When the various Carrington plans were offered, the authority of the European Community (E.C.) stood behind them. This authority lent credibility to the E.C. position taken in the August 27, 1991 Brussels Declaration stating that its members would never accept the politics of fait accompli. All of the E.C. plans were accepted by Slovenia, Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Croatia. These plans were all rejected by Serbia and Montenegro with the exception of one which Montenegro accepted and only Serbia rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At that time, the authority behind both the threats and incentives was very sparingly used. Involvement was growing, yet the avoidance of involvement remained a cherished political value. At that time, no economic or other sanction had been mentioned; there were only suggestions that those who accepted the plan would fare better economically. These suggestions had some credibility given the economic stature of the European Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1991, it was still unthinkable to mention military threat or protection. The E.C.'s very cautious and gradual use of authority actually resulted in a corruption of authority of some magnitude. Prestige was spent just up to the level where it was neither sufficient nor workable. After the first and succeeding plans were rejected, more powerful components of authority were brought into play. Time and again, the European Community, the United Nations, and the United States were ready to pay yesterday's price for a solution, but never the actual cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When military threats were finally used, they were followed up very sparingly. First, there were rumors that the Sixth Fleet would come to the Adriatic. Then, there were no-fly zones (which actually functioned as fly-watch zones), the threat of airstrikes, and finally, NATO. While it cannot be proven, I am quite convinced that a threat of economic sanctions in 1991 would have been effective. A clear promise of considerable economic aid might also have yielded a solution. At that time, however, such a solution appeared too radical. Later, sanctions were announced and introduced, but always at a time when they were no match for the stampede of new developments. The international community's and its key institutions' authority was devalued step by step as stronger and stronger &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*703]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  promises and threats were made but were never strong enough to do the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NATO was the last fragment of authority brought into play. According to a Bosnian Serb paper of July 1995, NATO was defeated by the Bosnian Serb Army. No matter how absurd this sounds, I think that there is some truth to this assertion. It was, of course, a limited showdown, but this is no excuse. If you compare the results in terms of casualties, NATO lost more people in the confrontation than the Bosnian Serbs lost. As far as material losses are concerned, NATO lost, among other things, several planes (Harriers around Gorazde, another plane in the area of Banja Luka, and two Predator spy-planes), while Bosnian Serbs suffered no equivalent losses from the NATO attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One can hardly contest that NATO has been a clear loser in terms of moral loss and damage to credibility. Not only were none of NATO's aims achieved, but NATO failed to even frustrate or forestall the aims of Karadzic and Mladic. Thus, the Bosnian Serbs' claim that they handed NATO a military defeat is not completely nonsensical. It is well known that NATO committed only a limited force and that it was hindered by a complicated chain of command. But the chain of command, chain of motivation, and deployment of adequate forces are decisive elements in each confrontation. Thus, the question has arisen whether, within the given political environment, NATO is capable of committing adequate forces and whether it is capable of persisting in its efforts with an adequate chain of command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The erosion of the authority of the international community's principal agents has continued. The irrationality of Milosevic's and Karadzic's actions have often been mentioned, although it can be argued that they behaved quite rationally in pursuing their own obsessions and interests, and in not bowing to the unrealized threats of NATO. After the fall of Srebrenica and Zepa, two safe havens designated by the Security Council, a new term was established in the international media: Srebrenica, Zepa, Gorazde, Sarajevo and Bihac became &quot;so-called safe havens.&quot; The next step in this direction may be the conversion of the Security Council into the &quot;so-called Security Council.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many are questioning whether peacekeeping efforts have actually accomplished anything. There are, of course, comprehensive reports, some of which were mentioned and cited during this conference, but I would like to relate to you some of my personal impressions. From talking to many people from the region, including friends and former students from Sarajevo, I can only say that the signals are contradictory. It has been said that the peacekeepers failed to keep peace because there was no peace to keep and the authority invested was never sufficient to create peace. I agree. Nevertheless, the United Nations did try to mitigate the tragedy and did achieve some positive results, an accomplishment which must not be underestimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How much of the success was attributable to UNPROFOR, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), or the International &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*704]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is difficult to determine and probably not too important to establish. In spite of this limited success, practically all warring factions have a negative picture of U.N. involvement. Recurring accusations emerge in stories about bribery and black-marketeering in which U.N. personnel play the main role. While I cannot confirm these reports, I can confirm that I heard them from many people and from all sides of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not easy to find neutral observers among the residents of Bosnia. However, some evidence which can be said to come from neutral sources may be cited. During the last several months, I had a chance to speak with some leaders of two very small groups who are in a truly impartial position. In July of last year, I attended a meeting in Geneva of intellectuals from all over the former Yugoslavia, organized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). One of the participants was a man who represented the Jewish community from Sarajevo. Some months later, in Budapest, I met the lady president of the Hungarian community of Sarajevo. Jews and Hungarians are both completely outside the ethnic dividing lines and ethnic strife in Bosnia. Sarajevo used to have a sizable Jewish community, originating mostly from Spain. It also had a small Hungarian community from the time of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, but most Hungarians came to Sarajevo from the ranks of the Hungarian minority in Yugoslavia. Some came to study, while others found jobs or established families. Both communities had several thousand members each, but both have dwindled down to only several hundred members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their two stories were quite similar. A central point of agreement was that Sarajevo's inhabitants have been facing severe restrictions imposed by three actors: the Serbian blockade (the cruellest actor), the Bosnian government itself, and UNPROFOR. One question I asked these representatives was whether they wanted to leave Sarajevo (They actually had a choice, since I met one of them in Geneva and the other in Budapest). Both stated that they had no desire to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president of Sarajevo's Hungarian community, whom I met in December 1994, is a professor of veterinary medicine. Her husband is Moslem and a professor of biochemistry. She said that many things had improved. For example, unlike the year before, her eight-year-old son now attends school without being exposed to a great danger of sniper attacks. At the same time, however, she explained that her son's school, had no windows, even in December. There was no glass to replace them. Wooden or tin windows would not suffice, since they would not let in daylight, and there was no electricity. So they had no windows. She also told me that sitting was very difficult since the chairs only had their metal frames (the wooden part was used for heating). She described these conditions as some sort of improvement, and she attributed it partially to the fact that UNPROFOR made getting to school somewhat safer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final point made by both my Jewish and my Hungarian acquaintances was quite striking. They stated that the strongest reason for the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*705]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  peacekeepers' continued presence was the fact that when there are U.N. peacekeepers present, the press is also there. This presence of the press imposes some restraint on the perpetrators of atrocities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. What Peace To Keep?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The ethnic landscape of the former Yugoslavia is improbably complex. A Serbian political leader (Vuk Draskovic) compared Yugoslavia's ethnic distribution to the design of a leopard skin. Throughout the course of history this ethnic diversity has often been a source of richness, but no less often a source of conflict. In my opinion, the present confrontation is not between Serbs, Croats, Moslem-Slavs, Albanians, Hungarians, and others, but between those who believe in the possibility and the sense of living together and those whose beliefs are built on the assumption that separation is the only solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact that these two ideas are expressed openly and explicitly is new. In Tito's Yugoslavia, the only legitimate concept was that of &quot;Brotherhood and Unity,&quot; and all other alternative concepts were suppressed (and oppressed). This clearly less-than-democratic imposition of &quot;Brotherhood and Unity&quot; did not mean that below the layers of official politics the opposing concept of &quot;unquenchable historic hatred&quot; remained the only reality. As a matter of fact, life in common had become a reality, and the relevance of history had faded. Tragic events of the past gradually lost their significance, and the prospect of living together was very much enhanced by multiculturalism and acceptance of distinct ethnic, religious, and linguistic identities. Having lived there, my impression is that the bulk of the present conglomerate of hatred is new hatred generated by escalation within the last ten years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This escalation became possible because of a power vacuum in a space which was suddenly left without authority. Disintegrating communist power opened the gates for the disintegration (or at best reorganization). In federal multiethnic states this power vacuum created a heightened level of societal danger. Constraints, those of the communist party and those of civilization as well, were significantly loosened. Political power, economic power, sovereignty, and national identities lost their bases so that everything was up for grabs. At the same time, the end of state-socialism triggered the end of a long-established international order, and the new situation resulted in confusing responses from international institutions. This is the climate in which ethnic separation established itself as an option within Europe and in which ethnic separation is gaining a resigned but growing international recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I would like to object to the option of ethnic separation, not only on moral grounds or on the basis of norms of civilization (which would be too easy), but on practical grounds as well. I am convinced that both ethical and practical considerations lead to the conclusion that the best way to keep peace in Bosnia and in the former Yugoslavia is through the establishment of a multiethnic and multicultural society. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*706]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even though events are moving towards ethnic separation, they have not even reached a half-way point. Recognizing the concept of ethnic separation is not just acquiescence in a status quo, it is an instigation of a continued cruel march towards the gruesome objective. Also, one must not forget that inter-ethnic marriages in Bosnia-Herzegovina constitute more than twenty percent of all marriages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In reviewing the practical considerations, one would also have to question whether all Serbs or all Croats could live harmoniously in one state, if such a state came into being. I submit that the cultural dissimilarities and differences in mentality between, for example, Krajina Serbs or Bosnian Serbs on the one hand and Vojvodina Serbs on the other hand, are much larger than the differences between the Vojvodina Serbs and the Vojvodina Hungarians, or the Vojvodina Slovaks. One should also ask what message will be sent to the former Soviet Union and to other areas experiencing ethnic tensions if the international community concludes that the only solution to ethnic differences is ethnic purity, ethnic partition and the changing of borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, leaders of nationalistic factions base their legitimacy on the concept that living together is impossible, a concept which stems from the claimed existence of an &quot;unquenchable historic hatred.&quot; This theory is questionable even in these nationalistic leaders' most immediate environment. General Mladic's wife is a Macedonian. Karadzic's vice president, Koljevic, has a brother who decided to stay in Bosnian-held Sarajevo and share its suffering. One can see from the phonebook of Sarajevo that, judging by their surnames, most telephone subscribers by the name of Karadzic are Moslems. Few people know that in those areas of Sarajevo which were bombarded by Karadzic and Mladic, there is still a sizeable Serbian population. Some of the Serbs hold important positions in the city administration and in the Bosnian Army as well. A delegation of Bosnian Serbs living in the territory held by the Bosnian government visited Belgrade during the Spring of 1995. They were received very warmly by the anti-war Serbian opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This leads me to my next point, which is that there is an anti-war and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbian opposition. There was and still is a peace </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several hundred thousand citizens of Serbia refused the draft, refused to join the civil war, and are still subject to criminal punishment. Nationalist leaders claim, of course, that all their ethnic brethren are with them, and this assumption is readily accepted by those international actors who feel that it would be too much trouble to oppose the realpolitik of ethnic partition. Note also that in December 1992, Milan Panic ran against Milosevic on a platform of multicultural coexistence. He argued for the recognition of Bosnia and Croatia and against the use of ethnicity as an organizing principle. As a consequence, Panic was labelled as a traitor by the Serbian government-controlled media, but he still received about thirty-five percent of the votes. Moreover, these were predominantly Serbian votes because the Albanians boycotted the election and the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*707]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hungarian minority constitutes less than five percent of the Serbian population (other minorities are even smaller).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, a lot of damage already has been done. Sometimes, reality moves towards negative stereotypes. In recent years, some members of ethnic factions have started acting in exactly the same way in which they were depicted earlier by the rival faction's propaganda. But this is not the whole reality of the former Yugoslavia. All ties have not been broken. There are many examples of bravery reaching beyond ethnic lines, and there are still many people who refuse to judge their neighbors by ethnic criteria. This remaining domain of multiculturalism is what has to be kept, and this is the only foundation on which peace may be built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Postscript from September 1995<BR>&nbsp;<BR>After this essay was written in September 1995, the international community discharged a response which cannot be labelled as sparing, or just-less-than-adequate. Bosnian Serb positions were heavily bombarded by NATO. Realities and attitudes have changed since, and chances for a settlement appear to be genuine. I still believe, however, that the price for the creation of such a chance would have been much lower a year or two earlier. A timely investment of adequate authority would have spared thousands of lives and would have prevented immense devastations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I still also believe that thrift and the desire for speed should not legitimate ethnic partition because peace cannot be reestablished within the former Yugoslavia without giving multiculturalism a chance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Introduction<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In the summer of 1997, as the first aggressive steps by the international community in Bosnia were being enacted, Jamie F. Metzl proposed that an &quot;information intervention unit&quot; be created within the United Nations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international community could use the information intervention unit to respond to broadcasting efforts that might be used to &quot;incite widespread violence in crisis zones.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such a unit would have, in Metzl's proposal, three primary functions: &quot;monitoring, peace broadcasting, and, in extreme &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*68]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cases, jamming radio and television broadcasts.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Metzl pointed to the explosive mobilizing role Radio Milles Collines had in Rwanda with its repetitious and explicit incitement for Hutu to slaughter Tutsi as one example where preventive intervention by the international community would have been suitable.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Metzl saw the techniques of information intervention as a way to broaden the range of intermediary opportunities available to the United Nations, NATO, or the United States during peacekeeping measures in ethnic and other conflicts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The world community's failure to halt the genocide in Rwanda,&quot; Metzl concluded, &quot;exposed the weakness of an international system that forces states to choose between the extremes of massive, armed humanitarian intervention and mere symbolic action... The time has come to develop, refine, and institutionalize information-based responses to incendiary mass communications.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more than six months in late 1997 and early 1998, the NATO Stabilization Force (Sfor), under orders from the Office of the High Representative (OHR), controlled key broadcast transmitters for &quot;security protection.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sfor's seizure of the transmitters was said to be necessary to ensure that information transmitted to Bosnian Serbs met the objectives of the Dayton Accords.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The active, directed, and explicit intervention in Bosnia raises to a new level the international debate about the appropriate role of media policy in preventing ethnic conflict and preserving peace-keeping processes. Bosnia-Herz. illustrates the full range of possible foreign assistance used to remold an indigenous media, from professional training to closing down of stations, all to improve the role of the information space in assuring a more democratic society. Bosnia-Herzegovina may be an exceptional case in the relationship between media and foreign policy. Examining the implementation of the Dayton Accords, however, is instructive for understanding approaches - especially in the most difficult of circumstances - by which the United States and the international community make decisions concerning the relationship between broadcasting and foreign policy. Bosnia provides a window into the debate over multilateral interventions justified in the name of obtaining objectivity and impartiality, avoiding ethnic conflict, and enhancing the right to receive and impart information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is growing recognition that threats to peace and to the international order now arise most often in bitter conflicts where words become &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*69]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the prelude to slaughter. After actual conflict begins, military strategies are rendered far more complex due to inflamed emotions intensified by the tactical use of radio and television.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a time of difficult and novel &quot;peacekeeping&quot; operations, disarming the media space has become a factor. It is against this background that the practices in Bosnia, demonstrating the complexities of refashioning a media and information space, become important to study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this Article, I focus on NATO's media policy during the first stages of its administration of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In particular, I examine the implementation of the Dayton Accords for instruction in understanding approaches that the United States and the international community make concerning the relationship between broadcasting and foreign policy. I describe NATO's media policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with special emphasis on the Bosnian Serb sector of Republika Srpska, and the seizure and control of broadcast transmitters there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part I of this Article provides a background on the role of the media in Bosnia, from the pre-war period through NATO's seizure of transmitters in Republika Srpska and post-seizure details. Part II explains the legal basis for information intervention. Part III covers the concept of information intervention at work in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Finally, the Conclusion offers a number of questions to consider while studying media and foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. The Bosnian Example</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Bosnian Television and the Role of the Media in the Bosnian War<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Media was used to spread terror and fan the flames of war in the former Yugoslavia.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several months before anyone in the region outwardly bore arms, nationalist leaders in the various Yugoslav republics began laying the groundwork for war by planning media campaigns. For example, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who is widely blamed for waging and instigating the war in Bosnia,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sent paramilitary troops and technicians to seize a dozen television transmitters in the northern and eastern parts of Bosnia in the spring of 1992.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These areas are close to Serbia and had substantial Serb populations. As a result, more than half the people in the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*70]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina began receiving the television signal controlled by Belgrade rather than the usual television from Sarajevo.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The idea of a unified Bosnia information space, with a national signal emanating from Sarajevo, was immediately fractured, and the stage was set to wage a fierce propaganda war that would precede any actual fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the airwaves firmly in his hands both in Serbia and in more than half of Bosnia, Milosevic broadcast fictitious reports that Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia were being massacred by Croat militiamen who drained the blood of Serb civilians before murdering them and that the main Muslim political party in Bosnia executed five of its own members for leaking word of a genocidal conspiracy against Serbs in the town of Bosanski Samac.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The propaganda countered the fact that Muslims, Serbs and Croats had co-existed side by side for nearly fifty years in Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia where there was a substantial intermarriage rate.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the majority of Serbs seemed to embrace the propaganda. There are varying interpretations for the reasons why, including historic ethnic divides arising out of the two World Wars  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the fact that Yugoslavia was a country whose media had always been controlled by the state.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The false reports were laden with Serb symbolism and historical references to Serb struggles against Ottoman Turks and the Bosnian Muslims who cooperated with them, and German Nazis and the Croat fascists who cooperated with them. The emotional appeal of Serbian struggle was so strong that questioning the truthfulness of the news reports was almost akin to betraying Serb culture. Some independent journalists in Belgrade wrote about the pernicious and dangerous potential of Milosevic-controlled television, but their publications did not have mass readership and hardly made a dent in combating the powerful nationalist television.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nationalist and inflammatory propaganda struck fear into the Serb population. When Belgrade television encouraged Serbs to arm themselves against the &quot;enemies of the Serb people,&quot; most Serbs in both Bosnia and Croatia did as they were told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbs were not the only ones who understood that the key to power and influence was television. Well before any fighting began in Bosnia, Croatian television was airing nationalist broadcasts warning that the Serbs intended to exterminate the Croat population in order to form a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*71]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Greater Serbia.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These incendiary programs suggested to Croats that they were in mortal danger from the Serbs and that they should arm themselves before it was too late.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bosnian television in Sarajevo did not broadcast a similar degree of propaganda and incendiary remarks. It took a more conciliatory tone, reporting on and emphasizing efforts being made to diffuse crisis. It contradicted predictions heard on Serbian and Croatian broadcasts that war was inevitable. In spite of this more even-handed approach, the Sarajevo government already knew that war, were it to occur, would be driven by television. Bosnian leaders begged U.S. officials at the U.S. embassy in Belgrade to jam Serbian television broadcasts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Serb and Croat television broadcasts incited the population to war, and throughout four years of fighting, nationalist programs continued to play a role in spreading the propaganda and hatred that fanned the war's flames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early 1992, the Bosnian Serb leadership left Sarajevo. Soon thereafter, the village of Pale became their self-styled capital.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost immediately, in April 1992, they began broadcasting their own television channel, Serb Radio and Television (SRT).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Firmly under the control of the nationalist leaders who would lead the war, SRT used the same tactics that Belgrade television had used before the war. Falsified reports of Serbs being slaughtered by Islamic fundamentalists and Croatian fascists (Ustashe) were the norm, as were false reports about Western conspiracies against the Serb nation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regardless of the content of the broadcasts, they were successful in stirring up hatred against Muslims and Croats. SRT also gave ample coverage to Serbs who had been killed by Croats allied with the Nazis during World War II. Ordinary Serbs came to believe that the &quot;Turks&quot; and the &quot;Ustashe&quot; were waging a war of aggression and that the Serbs needed to fight for the survival of their nation. They became convinced that if they did not begin &quot;cleansing&quot; Muslims and Croats from &quot;their territory,&quot; the Muslims and Croats would harm them.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the first year of the war, the Muslims and Croats were allied together against the Serbs. However, after the Serbs were pushed back &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*72]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from Croat territory in 1993, the Croats turned against their former Muslim allies. Again, television played a key role. The Croats, like the Serbs, wanted to carve out a piece of Bosnia for themselves to create a &quot;Greater Croatia.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Croatian television from Zagreb began broadcasting reports claiming that Islamic fundamentalists were trying to create a state where Catholic Croats would be oppressed and subjugated.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The broadcasts portrayed Muslims as dirty, anti-Christians, who were intent on depriving the Catholics of their religion and heritage.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strategy encouraged a sufficient number of Croats to fight against their Muslim neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent voices existed, taking views contrary to the official perspective, but they were routinely harassed, mostly unread or unheard, and did little to change public opinion. In Serbia, the radio station B-92 boldly criticized President Milosevic and opposed the war efforts. As a result, its editors were routinely harassed and its signals were frequently jammed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While B-92 received critical praise in international circles, its broadcasting frequency only reached a small radius within Belgrade and its programming was ineffective in changing Serbian public opinion both during and after the war. Several Serbian independent newspapers and magazines, highly critical of the Serbian actions, were available throughout the war.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They painted an accurate portrait of the &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; and fighting that was taking place in neighboring Bosnia, but they were read only by a small group of intellectuals and had almost no impact in changing public opinion. In neighboring Serb-controlled Bosnia, there were several independent newspapers that came out sporadically, but their journalists were harassed, jailed, and even killed, and some of their offices were bombed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> None successfully challenged the reach and effectiveness of the Bosnian Serb television station SRT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*73]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Croatia, the Feral Tribune, a newspaper that satirically criticized the Croatian government and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman's nationalist policies, was printed weekly during the war. However, its editors were routinely brought to trial.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Croatia's independent Radio 101 was also critical of the government and opposed the war efforts. Not surprisingly, the government tried to revoke its broadcasting license.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only a massive protest and international appeals from press and human rights groups kept Radio 101 on the air.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Hercog-Bosna, the Croat-controlled section of Bosnia, there was virtually no alternative press. The options were Croatian TV (HRT), Mostar TV, which was even more nationalistic and provocative than HRT, Radio Mostar, and newspapers loyal to the ruling Croatian Democratic Party (HDZ).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and Television (RTBiH) remained as it was prior to the war. Its reporting was fairly accurate and truthful. It did not spread anti-Serb nor anti-Croat propaganda, but it did report facts about the war. It neither exaggerated nor underplayed the atrocities committed by the Serbs and Croats, nor the number of number of dead each day in Sarajevo. Moreover, there were two independent television stations, Studio 99 and Hayat in Sarajevo, as well as several independent radio stations, notably Radio Zid and Radio Tuzla in Sarajevo. All were at times critical of Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic's policies.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oslobodjenje, famous around the world for continuing to print even during the worst days of Sarajevo's siege, was less critical of the Bosnian leadership than several other independent newspapers that published throughout the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. The Dayton Accords<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The war in Bosnia, a brutal combination of psychological manipulation and physical violence, ended with the Dayton Peace Agreement (the &quot;Accords&quot; or the &quot;Dayton Accords&quot;).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the summer of 1995, the United Nations mission to Bosnia was falling apart. Bosnian Serb leaders increasingly &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*74]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  used tactics such as taking U.N. peacekeepers hostage and holding up U.N. aid convoys.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Europeans threatened to withdraw their forces, effectively closing down the U.N. mission.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Months earlier, U.S. President Bill Clinton had agreed to commit American troops to assist with a U.N. pull-out from Bosnia. Faced with that disastrous scenario he dispatched Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, a seasoned diplomat, to negotiate a peace settlement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman came to Dayton, Ohio, where diplomats hammered out a peace settlement to end the war. The diplomats worked through the nights designing treaty boundaries acceptable to all parties and drawing the lines on the map. It was finally agreed that Bosnia would remain one country, but divided into two entities: Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That structure satisfied the Serbs because they were, in a sense, given the &quot;republic&quot; for which they were fighting, even though Republika Srpska is an &quot;entity,&quot; not an independent state. The agreement satisfied the Muslims because it, in a sense, kept Bosnia whole. It offered little to the Croats, except that, as part of the Muslim-Croat Federation, they were able to form special ties with neighboring Croatia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military component of the Dayton Accords took weeks to plan and was stated in great detail. The Clinton Administration's main aim was to end the fighting in Bosnia, so special care was given toward that goal. Deadlines were set for the release of political prisoners,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the separation of military forces,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and for weapons from all three armies to be put into barracks or destroyed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Accords called for heavily armed NATO troops, with a strong mandate to retaliate against any kind of attack against them, to be deployed for at least a year to enforce the military agreement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civilian aspects of the Dayton Accords were not prepared with the same attention to detail as the military component. The Accords stipulated that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) would organize elections;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the United Nations would oversee creation of an unarmed civilian police force to oversee the police forces in each &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*75]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entity;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) would oversee the return or resettlement of displaced peoples or refugees;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that a High Representative chosen by the Contact Group would coordinate the activities of the different organizations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The aim of these sections of the Accords was to reconstitute Bosnia's former multi-ethnic nature and create a Bosnian national identity against a backdrop of continuing ethnic hatred and loyalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elections would be the international community's most crucial task, as well as the most rigorous test of the Accords' future success. Although the OSCE had never before staged an election, it was chosen to oversee the elections because the United Nations was held in low repute in the region.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Accords specified that the OSCE would set up a Provisional Election Commission (PEC) to oversee elections at the federal, entity, and municipal levels.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PEC was specifically empowered to adopt electoral rules and regulations concerning the registration of political parties, voter eligibility, international observers, and all other measures that &quot;open and fair electoral campaigns&quot; could take place.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The parties were required to obey the PEC rules stipulated in the Accords, as well as any rules and regulations the PEC would create pursuant to the agreement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. State of the Media After the Dayton Accords<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The Dayton Accords were signed in Paris in December 1995 and immediately put into force. In addition to representatives from the United States, the Russian Federation, the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, the Accords were signed by the internationally recognized president of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Alija Izetbegovic, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exclusion of informally recognized Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat leaders from the signing would later have consequences in terms of perceived obligations &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*76]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to honor the Accords. For these nationalist leaders, although the fighting had been suspended, an underlying war was still underway. They conducted their war through the media, creating the potential for pent-up hostilities to explode into renewed conflict. To maintain control over their territories, nationalist Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat leaders clung to their party-controlled media. The Serb-held parts of Bosnia were still covered by broadcasts of the rabidly nationalist Serb Radio and Television (SRT) and the Croat-held parts of Bosnia continued to receive broadcasts from the rabidly nationalist Croatian Radio and Television (HRT). The Bosniak-controlled part of the country remained under the coverage of RTBiH.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three ethnic groups started vying for more effective use and control of the airwaves in their spheres of influence. Croats, Serbs, and Muslims all repaired war-damaged television transmitters on mountains in their respective territories, attempting to broadcast their frequencies as far and wide as possible.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Serbian government in Belgrade set up a television transmitter in Serbia near the border of the newly-created Republika Srpska to broadcast Serbian television throughout the Serb-controlled entity.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the Serbian government aided the Bosnian Serbs in repairing war-damaged transmitters.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Croatian government added additional transmitters in Croatia near the Bosnian border to broadcast Croatian television into Bosnian territory and aided the Bosnian Croats in repairing existing transmitters.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Croatian government also helped Bosnian Croats add additional transmitters to increase the coverage of Bosnian Croat television.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bosnian government received assistance from Norway to renovate and repair some twenty-one television transmitters to enhance the coverage of the multi-ethnic voice necessary to facilitate reconciliation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All parties in the war were clearly intent on continuing to spread their wartime doctrines during the peace brought about by the Accords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*77]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. Dayton Implementation and the Media<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Just days after the Dayton Accords were signed in Paris, Ambassador Robert Frowick, the American who headed the OSCE mission in Bosnia, arrived in Sarajevo to begin planning for the elections.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n61</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aware of the media's role in the war, and the role it would continue to play in peace, Frowick and the other diplomats implementing the Dayton Accords realized that changing the state of the partitioned and nationalistic media was crucial for unifying the country. Because the Accords established a timetable for national elections to take place within six to fifteen months after the Accords were signed, it was clear that a massive effort was required to foster a more pluralistic press in Bosnia. Without this stronger multi-ethnic voice, Bosnians - Muslims, Serbs and Croats - could be limited to information from their respective fiercely nationalistic and separatist television programs. If alternative sources of information were not provided across the country, the same nationalist leaders who waged the war and still controlled the airwaves were likely to be voted back into power. For the elections to be a success in terms of the Accords, the international community needed to play a role in adjusting media practices to assure a fuller and freer debate before the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizations involved in implementing the peace plan called on Bosnian politicians to soften their media's nationalist and provocative programming. The OSCE established a Media Experts Commission (MEC) as a sub-commission to the PEC.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MEC issued a set of rules and regulations the media was expected to follow that included &quot;providing true and accurate information,&quot; &quot;refraining from broadcasting incendiary programming,&quot; and running OSCE and international election-related statements and advertisements.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also ordered the three television systems controlled by the ruling parties in Bosnia's entities to provide opposition political parties with the same amount of advertising time as the ruling nationalist parties.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It then set up a monitoring group that could write citations for media violations of its rules and regulations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to establishing rules governing the existing media, the OSCE helped finance a special broadcast network. The Free Elections Radio Network (FERN) was part of a project initially started by the Swiss government to provide &quot;objective and timely information on the elections&quot; to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina in all entities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The project envisioned reaching seventy percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina well before the elections, with signals equally split between the Muslim-Croat Federation and &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*78]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Republika Srpska.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Bosnian Serb leadership claimed they could not install the transmitters FERN needed because the roads leading to the mountain installation sites were mined.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OSCE and the Swiss government did manage to get FERN on the air in Banja Luka, but within days, the Serb authorities blocked its transmission.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When FERN went on the air in July 1996, only two months before the vote, it reached only forty percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, all within the Muslim-Croat Federation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FERN thus had no impact in Republika Srpska, where the population was most in need of alternative sources of information.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, though FERN was created to influence the first elections, it remains on the air in Bosnia-Herzegovina today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E. Office of the High Representative (OHR) and the Open Broadcast Network (OBN)<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Even before the creation of FERN, OHR proposed creating an independent television network to provide balanced information prior to the elections.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The network's aim would be to provide all Bosnians with &quot;unbiased information&quot; from both local and international journalists, as well as commercial programs from around the world.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The network came to be known as the Open Broadcast Network (OBN). Until the Accords were finally signed in January 1996, OBN remained in its conceptual stage, and it was not until March 1996 that activity commenced to bring about the network. Governments and NGOs committed to establishing the OBN included the United States Information Agency (USIA), the European Union (EU), and the Soros Foundation's Open Society Institute (OSI).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 1996, the OSI sent media experts to conduct a feasibility and cost study.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The experts determined that for OBN to be effective, it would require an estimated $ 17.6 million.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A donors' conference was held in &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*79]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  May 1996, at which $ 13.5 million was pledged, $ 4 million short of the projected need.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The project was reconfigured and reduced in scope. Money came in slowly, making it increasingly unlikely that OBN would be up and running in time to make a difference for the September elections. However, the donors believed OBN could still have an impact on Bosnia-Herzegovina for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other problems with the project soon arose. Each donor country wanted its pledged money to go toward the purchase of specific pieces of equipment, often of its own manufacture. The money arrived late, and it often came with caveats. By August, just a month before the elections, OBN was still not on the air and both the peace mediators and the donor nations realized that the project's impact on the September elections would be negligible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OHR, OSI, USIA, and the EU continued with the project, finally creating a network of television stations that went on the air a few days before the election.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only a handful of stations, all but one in the Muslim-Croat Federation, agreed to be a part of the OBN.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only an estimated one-third of the Bosnian population could see it, with no coverage in Republika Srpska.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further, for its debut, the opening credits were written on a piece of paper, crookedly held by a pair of visible hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERN and OBN were not successful in their goal of creating a more pluralistic media across Bosnia-Herzegovina before the elections. Neither were other attempts to alter the media environment. UNESCO established a program bank in Sarajevo. It asked European countries to donate some of their national broadcasting about history, arts, and culture.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These programs would be broadcast on television stations across Bosnia-Herzegovina, helping to improve content and to avoid piracy. However, the effort had little success in producing more balanced broadcasts from the television stations. NATO troops also made an effort to spread alternative information. They created their own radio station, Radio Mir, or Peace Radio.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> USAID sponsored election advertisements that called on Bosnians in every entity to utilize their right to vote to ensure &quot;peace, democracy and the future of their country.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OSCE ordered all three party-controlled television &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*80]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stations to air the advertisements.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, according to local Bosnian newspapers, much of the population viewed the ads as condescending.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the negligible impact of the respective efforts of OBN, FERN, NATO, and other groups to provide the most ill-informed public with more objective information, and despite the fact that the nationalistic, party-controlled television stations in each entity continued to have the most influence over the respective ethnic populations, the OSCE went ahead with the September 1996 national elections.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not surprisingly, the same nationalist leaders who led their respective peoples through four years of war were re-elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the national elections were over, the international community in Bosnia-Herzegovina continued to emphasize the importance of establishing an independent and pluralist media in the country, particularly before the September 1997 municipal elections. In October 1996, one month after the national elections, the donors reconvened in Brussels. They agreed to continue supporting OBN until it became profitable, which they estimated could take anywhere from three to five years.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with the pledged support, the network was plagued with difficulties. The various sponsors started bickering with each other over how the network should be run. The Bosnian government began to feel threatened and became difficult. The Bosnia-Herzegovina state communications directorate sent a letter to the OHR accusing the international community itself of violating international law by, in effect, granting a license to OBN without coordinating with the legal authorities of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bosnian government filed a complaint with the International Telecommunication Union, claiming interference with the existing frequencies.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bosnian Serbs, who had refused to take part in OBN, accused it of being pro-Muslim.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even the stations participating in the network started getting angry. They expected funds and autonomy and got neither. They anticipated independence when producing programming for OBN, but a separate central OBN staff in Sarajevo was hired, vested with the power to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*81]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judge whether the programming offered by the participating stations met professional standards. More often than not, OBN central claimed the programming of the participating stations did not meet professional standards and much of it was never aired.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In consequence, OBN aired more internationally produced programs. All of the stations complained about their lack of independent control, and one of them, Studio 99, pulled out of the OBN.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the difficulties grew, it became clear that neither the Bosnians nor the donors were happy with OBN and that few people were watching it.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, in April 1997, the OSI withdrew its money and support, dealing the biggest blow yet to the network.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were rumors that the whole project would collapse. However, the donor nations and the EU vowed to continue financing the project,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and in August 1997, OHR hired a new team of Bosnians to run OSI.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">F. Direct Aid - USAID, Soros, EC/EU, and Others<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In addition to the OBN, the USIA, USAID, and other groups used other means to create and develop a more pluralistic press. Europe and Newly Independent States (ENI), a part of USAID, was disbursing contracts to Internews and IREX to provide training and buy equipment for television stations other than OBN.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), another branch of USAID, established offices in Banja Luka, Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Zenica and began providing direct grants to independent media.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OTI disbursed $ 6.3 million dollars to media in Bosnia-Herzegovina between February 1996 and November 1998.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the spring of 1997, the situation had changed somewhat. Several months before the municipal elections, the United States had decided to back Biljana Plavsic, a one-time Karadzic associate who had turned against the war-time leader and established a stronghold in Banja Luka. A tendency on the part of a local media source to favor Plavsic was likely to yield greater U.S. financial support. In the spring of 1997, OTI gave out $ 4 million &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*82]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dollars in media grants to nineteen newspapers, twenty-seven radio stations and eight television stations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few, if any, independent sources of news and information had been available in Republika Srpska in the spring of 1996, but by the next year, television, radio and newspapers supported by OTI helped inform the public about the power struggle between Plavsic and Karadzic.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The alternative media financed by OTI attempted to uncover past instances of government corruption, economic distress and lost opportunities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This laid the groundwork for Plavsic to consolidate power.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to these efforts by USAID, the EU and OSI, various governments gave direct grants, for training and equipment, to various independent media in both Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation. For example, OSI set up a broadcast training school in conjunction with the BBC where young journalists were brought to Sarajevo from all over Bosnia-Herzegovina for six weeks to receive training from BBC journalists and producers.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">G. Seizure of Transmitters and Post-Seizure Details<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In spite of these efforts to create alternative sources of information across Bosnia-Herzegovina, the media remained divided into three mutually antagonistic components based in Republika Srpska, Bosniak-controlled Federation territory, and Croat-controlled Federation territory. The respective party-controlled television stations remained the most influential media outlets and the main source of news for each of Bosnia's ethnic groups. The international community's attempts to create an alternative to the party-controlled media had not been sufficient to combat the nationalist television stations, which continued to stir up hostility. Indeed, the stations were not only hostile towards each other, but also towards the international community and Sfor. Sfor and the OHR felt that much of their work toward reconciliation was being jeopardized by the news and propaganda of nationalist television and radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 30, 1997, the members of the Steering Board (the Board) of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) of the Contact Group had their semi-annual meeting in Sintra, Portugal, to review the progress of Dayton's implementation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regarding the relationship between the media and the Dayton Accords, the Board concluded that &quot;the promotion of [an] &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*83]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  independent media is an essential step for developing democratic institutions.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This conclusion was formalized in the Sintra Declaration (the &quot;Declaration&quot;), which OHR treated as an extension of the Accords, though neither the elected Bosnian officials nor the original signatories to the Accords were required to sign the Declaration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Declaration attempted to encourage independent media in a variety of ways. In addition to calling for more support for the development of OBN, the Declaration called on the authorities of Bosnia-Herzegovina to &quot;give every possible form of practical assistance with respect to licenses, frequencies, free access by the High Representative to news media, and the ability of the OBN and other independent media to broadcast.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This dramatic assertion called for granting a right of access to the international authorities thus according the right to acquire time on radio and television and possibly receive free space in newspapers without the editorial discretion of their editors. The Declaration then stated that the High Representative &quot;has the right to curtail or suspend any media network or programme whose output is in persistent and blatant contravention of either the spirit or letter of the Peace Agreement.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This extraordinary provision of the Declaration established the right of Sfor and the OHR to block media outlets throughout Bosnia. It also provided the framework Sfor used to justify its later seizure of television towers in Republika Srpska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the months following the Sintra Declaration, Plavsic openly challenged Karadzic for power and accused him and his associates of war-profiteering and corruption. The fledgling independent newspapers and radio stations in Republika Srpska that had been receiving support from various international organizations and governments reported her condemnations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her message struck enough of a chord with the Serb people that she began building significant popular support. Desperate to find an alternative to Karadzic, the main impediment to successful implementation of the Accords, the United States and the other Western powers threw their backing behind Plavsic.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This support included a media-related strategy, with assistance from the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By July 1997, Plavsic's popularity had grown almost to the point that Republika Srpska was split in two. She controlled the western half, centered around Banja Luka, and the politicians loyal to Karadzic in Pale governed the eastern half. Nonetheless, the Pale faction still had control of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*84]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SRT, which was portraying Plavsic as a &quot;traitor to the Serb nation&quot; and a &quot;pawn of the international community.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unless Plavsic could more effectively reach the people receiving broadcasts from SRT, her chances of winning the electoral battle were slim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 14, U.S. Senator Carl Levin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, suggested that U.S. planes jam SRT signals while simultaneously transmitting &quot;broadcasts that depict the true reasons for [the Serbian people's] isolation and poor standing in the international community.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bosnian Serb leaders were furious. The Bosnian Serb information minister, Miroslav Toholj, stated that &quot;any U.S. administration operation to jam SRT will be considered an act of war and will be treated as such.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several days later, on August 18, OHR requested that SRT broadcast a statement intended to inform the Serb public about the content of the Sintra Declaration and the obligation of leaders on all sides in Bosnia to abide by it.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SRT refused. Instead, it ran a report comparing Sfor with the Nazis and referred to them as &quot;occupying forces.&quot; With the logo &quot;SS-for&quot; instead of Sfor, the broadcast alternated images of Sfor soldiers with World War II German Stormtroopers.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a response on August 23, the new High Representative, Carlos Westendorp, sent a letter to Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb member of the Bosnia-Hercegovian Presidency, demanding that SRT broadcast an OHR statement explaining the Sintra Declaration by 10 PM that day.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the letter, Westendorp wrote, &quot;if this is not done, I am prepared to use my powers, including those stemming from the Sintra Declaration.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was essentially a threat to impose a protectorate over SRT. Westendorp called the broadcast comparing Sfor to Nazis &quot;absolutely unacceptable.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He suggested Sfor might take action by seizing television towers to stop the Pale media propaganda against the peace forces in Bosnia.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SRT promptly submitted to Westendorp's demand, and broadcast the statement before the deadline. However, immediately afterwards, SRT announced that the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*85]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  High Representative's actions exceeded the bounds of the Dayton Accords and re-broadcast the clip comparing Sfor to the Nazis.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claiming that SRT management in Karadzic-controlled Pale was &quot;stirring up political conflicts and engaging in an aggressive propaganda that [was] breaking up state unity,&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the SRT station in Banja Luka announced that it was cutting its ties with the SRT management in Pale. Until that time, the SRT station in Banja Luka only re-transmitted news from Pale and had very little of its own programming. The employees at the Bajna Luka SRT station, sympathetic to Plavsic, had been working for days to create their own programs. On August 24, SRT Banja Luka began airing its own programming.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three days later, police loyal to Plavsic seized the Duge Njive transmitter near Doboj, one of the largest cities in the western half of Bosnia and the tower began broadcasting SRT programming from Banja Luka.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SRT's broadcast territory was now split in two, with SRT Banja Luka broadcasting to the western half of Republika Srpska, and SRT Pale to the eastern half.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 22, U.S. troops seized a television broadcast tower in Udrigovo, a northeastern town, under the pretense that they were trying to prevent possible clashes between Plavsic's supporters and Karadzic's supporters. Chris Riley, a Sfor spokesman, stated that the seizure was not intended &quot;to influence which programme will be broadcast via the transmitter. All we want is to prevent conflicts, but we will use any force deemed necessary at any attempt of violence.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seasoned observers assumed Riley's statements were intended to mask Sfor's intent to hand the tower over to SRT Banja Luka.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Sept. 1, the U.S. troops guarding the tower were attacked by a mob of more than two hundred and fifty Serbs who were presumed to be supporters of Karadzic.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pale radio broadcast that Sfor had &quot;occupied&quot; an SRT transmitter and claimed Sfor was a &quot;heavily-armed military force threatening courageous unarmed citizens.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*86]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the seizure, SRT Pale's signal could not reach the northeastern part of the Republika Srpska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What followed was a negotiation between the Sfor and the Pale authorities, resulting in a document that became known as the Udrigovo Agreement (the &quot;Agreement&quot;).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pursuant to the Agreement, on September 2, 1997, Sfor handed the tower back to the SRT authorities in Pale.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Included in the Agreement were the following conditions: that the Republika Srpska media stop producing inflammatory reports against Sfor and the other international organizations implementing the Dayton Accords;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that SRT Pale would regularly provide an hour of prime time programming to air political views other than those of the ruling party;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that SRT Pale provide Westendorp with a daily half hour of prime time programming to introduce himself and talk about recent developments;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that the Republika Srpska agree to abide by all the rules being established by the international community's Media Support Advisory Group (MSAG), which had not yet been formally declared but was in the process of being constructed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the Udrigovo Agreement and the formation of the MSAG, the Serb leadership in Pale appeared to take a more conciliatory tone towards the Western diplomats implementing the Accords. On September &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*87]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  4, the Bosnian Serb Ministry of Information agreed to allow OBN to broadcast from one of its transmitters on Mount Trebevic.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that cooperation was short-lived. On September 8, the OHR and Sfor sent a letter to SRT Pale demanding ninety minutes of airtime to broadcast an OHR program that same evening, an hour of airtime the following day, and ten minutes of airtime for the High Representative on Thursday, September 11 and Saturday, September 13, all unedited.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n136</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SRT Pale contended that these demands were far in excess of the requirements of the Udrigovo agreement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n137</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SRT Pale refused to broadcast the material, and instead accused OHR and Sfor of violating &quot;freedom and human rights.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n138</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SRT Pale newscaster read a statement from the SRT Pale editorial board stating:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> We publicly announce that under no conditions would we implement these requests. By doing this, we would trample on our moral integrity and our profession. In our radio and TV broadcast, we shall continue to ridicule orders like the one saying that video material must be broadcast in its entirety and with no changes ...  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n139</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> The announcer then invited the High Representative to appear live &quot;as a guest on the programme and talk to journalists and the audience instead of cowardly squeezing into programmes and sending ultimatums to broadcast pre-recorded tapes.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n140</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this background of increased conflict on the airwaves of Republika Srpska, and the raised stakes for political control of the SRT as the election drew nearer, the appeal for international jamming of SRT Pale gained currency. The United States dispatched three Air Force EC-130 Commando Solo planes capable both of broadcasting information and jamming existing radio and television signals.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n141</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These aircraft had been used for similar purposes in Haiti, Panama, and Grenada. U.S. officials claimed that the primary role of the electronic warfare planes would be to broadcast &quot;fair and balanced news and information&quot; to the local population,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n142</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts to Bosnia-Herzegovina also stated that the planes had the capability to jam pro-Karadzic transmissions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n143</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VOA reported the American belief that Karadzic supporters had violated the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*88]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Udrigovo Agreement that mandated the supporters soften their rhetoric against Plavsic and NATO peacekeeping troops.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n144</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The VOA broadcasts during this critical time also included an interview with Pentagon spokesman Dave Arlington who stated: &quot;Commander Sfor controls the airwaves in Bosnia-Herzegovina, OK, so he is well within his mandate to be able to broadcast; and he will be the guy that's managing the frequencies and the broadcasts there within the theater.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n145</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This contention made clear what had been only obliquely suggested before, namely that Sfor had ultimate control of the airwaves in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This disturbed not only the Karadzic faction, but the other Bosnian factions as well, all of whom became more vocal against what they called &quot;media colonization.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n146</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western press freedom organizations also protested possible jamming.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n147</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The planes were not put into immediate service, but were held in readiness at bases in Italy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n148</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the local elections loomed nearer, and the battle for the Republika Srpska's airwaves correspondingly grew more bitter, Western diplomats feared the media conflict could lead to more violence. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was urged to summon Plavsic and Krajisnik to Belgrade. That meeting, held on September 24, produced the Belgrade Agreement, an internationally brokered &quot;fairness doctrine&quot; for SRT Banja Luka and SRT Pale. The Belgrade Agreement stated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> President Biljana Plavsic  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n149</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and President Momcilo Krajisnik  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n150</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agree that the unified media environment of the Republika Srpska and free access to media by all participants in elections is vital for their being held in a democratic manner. They agreed that news programmes be broadcast daily from studios in Pale and Banja Luka alternately.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n151</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Hope for a harmonious implementation of the Belgrade Agreement was immediately dashed. Only a day after it was signed, the MSAG &quot;expressed concern about the editorial policies&quot; of SRT Pale.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n152</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A news release from the OHR stated that SRT Pale continued to broadcast political announcements as news &quot;devoid of any balance or alternative opinion.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n153</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Characteristically, SRT Pale refused to soften its editorial content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*89]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The following day, on September 26, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (the Tribunal), Louise Arbour, gave a press conference in Sarajevo, which was covered by SRT.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n154</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bosnian Serb leadership had always maintained that the Tribunal was not a legitimate juridical body, but rather a political body designed to denigrate the reputation of the Serbs. Consistent with this view, an SRT Pale announcer introduced Arbour's press conference with a commentary claiming that the Tribunal was a political instrument and that it was prejudiced against the Serbs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n155</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations, which is a member of the MSAG, considered this a breach of prior understandings, including the Udrigovo Agreement, and demanded that SRT Pale make a public apology on television.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n156</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On September 30, SRT Pale did so, stating, &quot;Serb-Radio-TV in this way wishes to apologize unreservedly for its misrepresentation of a news conference given by the prosecutor of The Hague Tribunal, Louise Arbour. We will read out a statement to this effect made by the prosecutor. The statement will be followed by the complete and unedited footage of the news conference given by Judge Arbour last Friday, during her visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n157</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of SRT Pale's apology, Sfor troops seized control of certain SRT transmitters on October 1 and prevented SRT Pale from transmitting its broadcasts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n158</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to claiming that SRT Pale's commentary was a violation of the Sintra Declaration, Western governments also claimed that SRT Pale's repeated broadcast comparing Sfor troops to Nazis constituted a threat to the safety of the Sfor soldiers and therefore needed to be silenced.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n159</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether out of conviction or from political need to state solidarity with those in Pale, Plavsic sent a letter to the High Representative, requesting him to allow SRT Pale to resume broadcasting. &quot;Your Excellency,&quot; she wrote,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> on the occasion of your decision that Sfor take over and assume control of most relays in the Serb Republic, I urge you to enable the broadcasting of television programmes from the Banja Luka and Pale studios....Your action is justified and there was indeed a violation of the [Udrigovo] agreement&lt;elip&gt;.However, it is not in the interest of the Serb Republic that Pale television be excluded from the unified television network of the Serb Republic. I urge you to consider this.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n160</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*90]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Sensitive to the potential for condemnation of the seizure, Sfor and OHR announced that SRT Pale could regain access to the transmission network and resume operations, but only if strict conditions were met. SRT Pale would be obliged to agree to &quot;criteria for its reconstruction and reorganization, as well as for editorial control of broadcasting, as suggested by the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the international community.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n161</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To protest the silencing of their station, employees at SRT Pale went on strike. They then held a meeting with twenty local radio stations in Republika Srpska and sent an appeal to the international community to &quot;lift the blockade of the SRT transmitters.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n162</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Banja Luka meanwhile, the Association of Journalists of Republika Srpska (UNRS) stated that they agreed with the demands of the striking journalists at SRT Pale and appealed for Sfor to return the four transmitters it had seized.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n163</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the association, which was loyal to Plavsic, also stated that it &quot;'would be wise' if the SRT board of management, headed by Krajisnik, were to resign&quot; and if the Republika Srpska government &quot;appointed an interim managerial board consisting of party representatives and non-party people until the new republican parliament [was] constituted.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n164</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several days after NATO seized the transmitters, Robert Gelbard, the U.S. special envoy for the Balkans, appeared in the region. He met with both Krajisnik and Westendorp. The same day, Simon Haselock, Westendorp's spokesman, announced that the OHR was &quot;developing a strategy for solving the issue of political influence on the media in Bosnia-Herzegovina.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n165</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following day, Westendorp dictated the criteria SRT Pale needed to meet in order to go back on the air. He demanded that all politicians (including Krajisnik and information minister Toholj) withdraw from SRT's board of directors and give up their right to control the station.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n166</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a letter to Krajisnik two days later, the High Representative went on to say that (1) a &quot;transitory international director-general&quot; and two deputies would be appointed by the OHR to head SRT Pale; (2) that the OHR would draft a statute and editorial charter for the station; (3) that SRT Pale would be obliged to broadcast programs requested by officials from the international community without editing or commentary; and (4) that a team of journalists and editors would be brought in to train personnel and supervise &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*91]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the programming of SRT Pale.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n167</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that SRT journalists and editors would be evaluated by the international representatives and that &quot;only those who are positively evaluated will be able to get a job again.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n168</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was an extraordinary assertion of power by the High Representative and it infuriated the Bosnian Serb leadership in Pale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 10, the editor of SRT Pale announced, &quot;the international community is planning to introduce a protectorate over Serb Radio-Television and to destroy it.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n169</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Krajisnik and the Bosnian Serb Prime Minister at the time, Gojko Klickovic, rejected Westendorp's demands and challenged the OHR's legal basis for seizing the TV transmitters and re-organizing the board of directors of SRT Pale.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n170</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a twist of historical fate,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n171</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Russians announced that the international community's blockade on SRT Pale was an untenable violation of the Belgrade Agreement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n172</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the staff of SRT, deprived of their normal distribution methods and allegedly on strike, kept trying to devise ways to get around the NATO blockade.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n173</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much to the chagrin of Sfor, the Serbs figured out how to broadcast by circumventing the TV transmitters Sfor had seized.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n174</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On October 16, twelve days after the NATO blockade began, SRT Pale began broadcasting again, using the same frequencies of SRT Banja Luka.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n175</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Suddenly, viewers could watch SRT Pale in the eastern parts of the Republika Srpska.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n176</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SRT Pale newscasters also announced the end of their strike but made no mention of the Sfor seizure.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n177</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A news bulletin stated that its viewers were satisfied at &quot;again having the opportunity to watch programmes broadcast by Serb Sarajevo Studio.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n178</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SRT Pale had disconnected SRT Banja Luka's signal from a critical TV transmitter (Veliki Zep) near Han Pijesak (the site of Ratko Mladic's military &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*92]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  headquarters).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n179</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the only transmitter not under Sfor's control.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n180</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SRT Pale then used special military vehicles fitted with broadcasting and jamming equipment to transmit its programs in contravention of the NATO blockade.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n181</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took Sfor two days to figure out what had happened.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n182</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Intelligence reports initially indicated that the Veliki Zep transmitter was the source of the broadcasts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n183</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, when Sfor troops inspected the site, they found it stripped of equipment and incapable of transmitting anything.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n184</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On October 19, Sfor called the destruction of the Veliki Zep transmitter an act of sabotage designed to block the transmission of SRT Banja Luka into eastern Serbia.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n185</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO responded immediately by deploying one of its Commando Solo electronic warfare planes to jam the mobile SRT Pale broadcasts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n186</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plane also transmitted a message to Serbs in eastern Bosnia that the Pale authorities were responsible for the interruption of regular SRT Banja Luka programming.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n187</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the same day, a mysterious explosion destroyed a transmitter in Bijeljina that was key to SRT Pale's ability to circumvent the NATO blockade.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n188</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SRT Pale's broadcasting ability effectively was destroyed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n189</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several days later, Western diplomats in Sarajevo suggested broadcasting SRT Banja Luka to eastern Bosnia via U.S. satellite.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n190</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By October 31, this was done and Serbs in eastern Bosnia could watch only &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*93]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SRT Banja Luka.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n191</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever resourceful, Karadzic's faction in Pale discovered yet another way to continue broadcasting. On November 4, they set up an &quot;electronic media&quot; center in eastern Bosnia, this time in Foca.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n192</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This &quot;technical and information center&quot; had the capability of broadcasting SRT Pale programs to a significant portion of eastern Bosnia.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n193</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This time, because the action did not interfere with the transmission of Banja Luka television, NATO and the OHR did not take action.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n194</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the OHR started expressing dissatisfaction with Croat TV (HTV) in Mostar. Simon Haselock, the OHR spokesman, accused the studio in Mostar of &quot;persistently resisting demands to tone down its reports&quot; and of using &quot;provocative language.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n195</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He took particular offense to a program aired by HTV Mostar that described Croats who wanted to co-exist with Muslims as &quot;lunatics&quot; and threatened that &quot;NATO would take measures against HTV Mostar similar to those taken against Serb Radio-TV.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n196</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Croats reacted angrily. The editor-in-chief of HTV Mostar, Milan Sutalo, said that the station had never received any demands from the OHR to tone down its rhetoric and he called &quot;the statement that HTV Mostar described those Croats who wanted to co-exist with Muslims as lunatics an unprecedented lie.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n197</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He challenged the OHR to produce a public recording of the statement, or present evidence of any other &quot;provocative&quot; statements issued by HTV Mostar.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n198</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He even went so far as to accuse the OHR of systematically attempting to destroy any independent Croat media.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n199</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He demanded an apology from the OHR and threatened to &quot;approach international organizations for the protection of the freedom of the media and human rights, and possibly initiate court proceedings.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n200</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*94]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On October 27, the international community put HTV Mostar to the test. After the station aired what was found to be a biased report on a car bombing in Mostar, the OSCE, which was monitoring the broadcast, ordered HTV Mostar to read a statement of apology in the first 15 minutes of primetime newscasts for five consecutive evenings.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n201</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milan Sutalo refused to read the statement and declared that the international community's desire to eliminate HTV Mostar was &quot;part of a broader strategy aimed at marginalizing and exerting pressure against Bosnian Croats.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n202</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On November 9, Sutalo resigned, citing his unwillingness to read the OSCE statement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n203</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said reading it would have besmirched his dignity.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n204</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When he left the station, many of his loyal staff members followed him, causing HTV Mostar to go off the air.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n205</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bosnian government officials and local journalists were thrilled that the international community finally shut down what they deemed Croat hate television.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n206</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, they complained that the OHR, Sfor, and the OSCE were not doing enough about Mostar TV and the new Bosnian Serb network.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n207</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Haselock responded to these complaints by stating, &quot;what we can do in this particular case is to monitor their programmes in order to establish whether they have been violating the rules and regulations of the Media Expert Commission.

<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Everything will be different from the New Year onwards, when a new media commission starts operating within the OHR (The Commission for Media Regulation and Licensing).

<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. The Legal Basis for Information Intervention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Introduction<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Bosnia is an institutionally and legally complex case study of the phenomenon newly christened as &quot;information intervention.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n216</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the world of ethnic and regional conflict, whether it involves Zapatistas in Mexico, Kurds in Turkey, separatists in Ethiopia, or Tamils in Sri Lanka, terrestrial transmitters and signals from satellites can become elements in campaigns of violence by or against the state, and between communities with different views of the public order. Specific actors in the international community, however, see the use of media as a potential tool to reduce conflict or to increase the possibility of democracy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n217</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bosnia experienced the use of almost all the instruments of information intervention.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n218</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international community provided assistance to rebuild the infrastructure of the existing media, established an alternate media network, set requirements for the electoral regulation, forced &quot;corrective&quot; and official broadcasts, and created a legal framework for media performance. It also jammed broadcasts, seized transmitters, and transformed &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*96]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the staff and leadership of broadcasting entities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n219</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Internationally designed and staffed media regulation bureaucracies, some tied to elections and some not, were all introduced in Bosnia.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n220</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, the OHR attempted to rationalize the process by creating a comprehensive new regulatory scheme for a post-NATO, pluralistic, and unified multi-ethnic state.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n221</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the international community is likely to use this type of intervention as part of its peacekeeping arsenal, greater attention must be paid to its legal framework, the circumstances in which it is justified, the extent to which it is multilateral as opposed to unilateral, the structure of standards and remedies, the relationship of the military to civilian authorizations, and the role existing international norms should play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. The Law of Information Intervention<BR>&nbsp;<BR> A fundamental question involves authority. What was the basis for the international community to intervene in Bosnia and reshape Bosnia's media and information space?  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n222</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is no minor problem and already there are debates about the sources of such authority.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n223</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If intervenors do not act pursuant to legal authority themselves, their moral claim that conflict participants must follow the rule of law loses its credibility. Various groups within Bosnia questioned whether the international community had the legal power to reshape the information space in Bosnia. Outside groups, including the World Press Freedom Committee, expressed grave reservations as to whether the international community's actions in Bosnia were consistent themselves with international norms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legal justification for media intervention in Bosnia is nowhere clearly stated; nor is it necessarily true that the United States and other parties sought or articulated such a legal justification at each step in the process as they constantly had to respond to practical realities. But the source of law matters. For example, if the United States and its Western allies acted as &quot;occupiers,&quot; then a particular body of international norms &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*97]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would govern their powers and the limits on them.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n224</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If they acted, on the other hand, under a consent regime, then the shape of their authority would be governed, in large part, by the conditions of their particular entry into Bosnia.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n225</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under current norms, which are subject to debate, the terms &quot;occupation&quot; and &quot;belligerent occupation&quot; do not describe the status of the international presence in Bosnia.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n226</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is important because occupiers have the capacity to act in lieu of a sovereign, although those actions are constrained by the duty to serve as a surrogate for the local sovereign and to do so in accord with internationally established standards.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n227</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, in the Bosnian &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*98]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  context, the limits of intervention start, as everything must, with the General Framework Agreement for Peace, the Dayton Accords themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The significance of the Dayton Accords is that the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia essentially consented to let the international community enter Bosnia.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n228</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other words, the powers of NATO, the OSCE, and the OHR, to the extent they arise from the Dayton Accords, come from the Parties to the Accord, not from the use of force or from other international doctrines. Annex 6 of the Dayton Accords provides that the Parties &quot;shall secure to all persons within their jurisdiction the highest level of internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms,&quot; including freedom of expression.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n229</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Restructuring the media, including displacing some media outlets and building new ones, might be termed, in a radical sense, the securing of freedom of expression.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n230</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the actions described in the narrative were taken at the order of the OHR.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n231</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Annex 10 of the Accords recognizes that fulfillment of each Party's obligation under the terms of the treaty requires &quot;a wide range of activities&quot; including &quot;the establishment of political and constitutional institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina,&quot; and the creation of a High Representative whose duties are &quot;to facilitate the Parties' own efforts and...coordinate the activities of the organizations and agencies involved in the civilian aspects of the peace settlement.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n232</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This general architectural commitment could be read to include the kinds of powers that Sfor and NATO exercised in reshaping the media of Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Annex 1-A, the Agreement on the Military Aspects of the Peace Settlements, each Party recognized that NATO would establish a multinational military implementation force (first known as IFOR and then as Sfor) &quot;composed of ground, air and maritime units from NATO and non-NATO nations, deployed in Bosnia...to help ensure compliance&quot; with the Accords.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n233</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Annex authorized IFOR to &quot;take such actions as required, including the use of necessary force...to ensure its own protection.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n234</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Annex 3 the Parties agreed to ensure &quot;free and fair elections in...a politically neutral environment&quot; and, to that end, they pledged to uphold &quot;freedom of expression and of the press.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n235</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Additionally, the Parties invited the OSCE to &quot;supervise, in a manner to be determined by the OSCE &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*99]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and in cooperation with other international organizations the OSCE deems necessary, the preparation and conduct&quot; for specific elections, including the elections involved in the post-Dayton media disputes.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n236</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Accords are a charter of authority, a specific and bounded invitation to particular actors in the international community to participate in the peace process in explicitly limited ways. They grant the international community three important fonts of power. The first font of power is election-specific and flows from Annex 3 of the Dayton Accords.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n237</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the aspirations embodied in the Dayton Accords and much of the international community's involvement in Bosnia concerned the political process and the media's indispensable involvement therein.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n238</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The authority of the international community in this area lay with the OSCE.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n239</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, the OHR, with its powers to &quot;coordinate&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n240</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and to &quot;facilitate&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n241</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had power, derivatively, to deal with media questions relating to elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the PIC supported a comprehensive OHR media strategy because of &quot;the importance of the role of objective media in the run-up to the 1998 elections ....&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n242</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If a plural, multi-party Bosnia-Herzegovina was to emerge from Dayton, then, at least in the eyes of the OHR, a morphological unity between political party, ethnic group, and dominant channel had to be broken. The OHR saw the Bosnian media structure as antithetical to a multi-ethnic future polity. The seizure of the transmitters that serviced SRT Pale was therefore part of a strategic plan to break the hold of the SDS on the media and the electorate.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n243</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In establishing the machinery for elections, the Parties agreed to put in place a set of election principles and a mechanism for deciding when those principles were violated.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n244</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, the PEC established rules and regulations ranging from professional and ethical standards for the media and journalists,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n245</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> standards for fair reporting,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n246</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and standards concerning inflammatory language.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n247</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international community also established a Media Experts Commission.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n248</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This entity had the basic &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*100]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  characteristics of an administrative bureaucracy and, through its Subcommissions,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n249</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> heard complaints and issued decisions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n250</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second font of power involves the authority of the military to accomplish its missions and to protect itself.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n251</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This power stems from Annex 1-A and other portions of the Dayton Accords and is in some sense self-evident. However, its apparent simplicity masks difficult questions surrounding the authority of individuals and groups to take specific actions in Bosnia. In some instances NATO troops acted as a result of military command decisions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n252</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NATO troops were not subject to the direct authority of the High Representative, though the OHR had coordinating responsibilities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n253</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, the decision in 1997 to return the Udigrovo Tower to SRT Pale was made by Sfor and not by the High Representative.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n254</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here, too, however, the High Representative gained authority to intervene in Bosnia's media regime because of his relationship to the military. He could request that Sfor take actions to enforce OHR or OSCE sanctions, but Sfor was not required to implement any OHR directives.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n255</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third font of power is the broadest. It stems from the executive power of the OHR itself and overlaps with the other two fonts of power.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n256</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Accords granted few specific powers to the OHR and, as a consequence, the OHR's powers sometimes grew organically, due to broad interpretations of the Accords mandated by the circumstances on the ground.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n257</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to the media, however, the OHR emerged as an idealized &quot;information intervention unit&quot; backed by the support of the international community. It encapsulated the contradictions, the constitutional dramas, and the question of standards in determining what actions to take with respect to the media.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n258</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OHR became the receptacle for international hopes.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n259</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Bonn Statement, the PIC &quot;reiterated its firm commitment to establish free and pluralistic media throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n260</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More importantly, it &quot;supported the High Representative's overall media and telecommunications strategy.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n261</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This broad focus on the OHR as manager of the Bosnian media strategy emerged from the Sintra Declaration.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n262</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Contact Committee, the six-country coordinating &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*101]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  committee of NATO powers, expressed confidence in the OHR and its role in regulating media in Bosnia in the Sintra Declaration.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n263</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Declaration is an example of the formulation of law as a post hoc clarification of power and extension of authority necessitated by circumstances on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sintra Declaration's grant of media intervention power to the OHR is quite extraordinary, both in terms of the standard for intervention and the remedies it authorized. The Declaration recognized that standard remedies such as fines, warnings, or even corrective broadcasts - the OSCE's remedies in the election context - may not be sufficient in other circumstances. Sintra consequently authorized the OHR to curtail, suspend, and close down media networks or programs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n264</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These were dramatic remedies but they were remedies that the OHR and NATO had already employed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n265</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sintra Declaration authorized not only punitive sanctions, but also expanded the OHR's capacity to develop a new architecture of media regulation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n266</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Standards for Exercising Authority<BR>&nbsp;<BR> For the rule of law to have meaning in the context of information intervention there must be clearly articulated standards and mechanisms to interpret and apply those standards fairly.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n267</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This generalization about administrative justice is particularly applicable to the Sintra standard, which allowed the OHR to curtail media actors engaging in &quot;persistent and blatant contravention of either the letter or the spirit of the Peace Agreement.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n268</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because only primitive media regulatory machinery (the MSAG, at most) existed,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n269</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> there was no process for the OHR or the military to determine whether a particular act violated the standard. There was no process of review, nor any opportunity for SRT Pale to have a formal hearing to determine whether its actions violated the Sintra standard or whether the OHR's sanctions were appropriate given SRT's actions. The lack of a formalized process may have been necessary given the complexity of the media situation in Bosnia. On the other hand, post-Sintra events indicate that a standard in fact evolved to guide the SRT's actions in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frequent statements by the OHR provide some sense of how the OHR read the Sintra Declaration.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n270</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here, too, an important distinction should &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*102]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be made. The PEC, as administered by the OSCE, established and announced a mechanism that allowed the Media Experts Commission to develop, clarify, and apply the code.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n271</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the Sintra Declaration, on the other hand, there was a kind of common law development: the OHR or its spokesperson articulated standards that changed in indefinite ways. While the MSAG existed as an advisory group, it did not have the deliberative authority of the Media Elections Commission.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n272</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Penalizing actors for &quot;persistent and blatant contravention of either the spirit or the letter of the Peace Agreement&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n273</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a fairly open standard subject to the exercise of enormous discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the OHR viewed the seizure of four transmitters on October 2, 1997 as necessary following &quot;the grotesque distortion of the press conference with Judge Louise Arbour&quot; by SRT Pale.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n274</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Additionally, &quot;the distortion of the interview with Judge Arbour, a distinguished international judge, was the last straw&quot; in a long catalogue of flagrant breaches by SRT Pale of agreements reached between it and the international community.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n275</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The remedy of seizure was appropriate because SRT's broadcast apology, even though it predated the seizure, &quot;was, although welcome, frankly too little, too late.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n276</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Military action in response to another breach was inevitable, especially in light of the final warning issued by the OHR and General Shinseki in a letter to SRT Pale on September 10, 1997.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n277</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OHR also justified its action by referring to the Belgrade Agreement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n278</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Belgrade Agreement, President Plavsic and President Krajisnik &quot;agreed that the unified media environment of the Republika Srpska and free access to media by all participants in elections [was] vital for their being held in a democratic manner,&quot; and that &quot;news programmes [should] be broadcast daily from studios in Pale and Banja Luka alternately.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n279</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Belgrade Agreement was important but not necessarily useful to justify the Sfor October seizure of SRT Pale's transmitters. SRT Pale may have distorted the presentation of Judge Arbour, but that did not violate the provisions of the agreement calling for SRT studios in Pale and Banja Luka to alternate their broadcasts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n280</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those provisions were designed to insure that neither Pale nor Banja Luka monopolized the Bosnian Serb information space. However, the Udrigovo Agreement provided a more likely &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*103]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  source of justification for the October seizure.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n281</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Udrigovo Agreement was extremely important because it articulated specific standards to guide the actions of SRT Pale.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n282</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an October draft memorandum, the OHR also stated that it &quot;intended to break the control of the SDS and those agents of the hard-line regime in Pale which are using the media, together with the police force, as the main tool to manipulate and control the [Republika Srpska] people.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n283</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was a separate and new standard for intervention that enabled the OHR to stop those practices of SRT Pale that &quot;manipulated and controlled the [Republika Srpska] people.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n284</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, the OHR required &quot;the removal of all direct party political influence&quot; from SRT Pale and the transformation of the network into a station that &quot;operates in a fashion that is consistent with Western democratic standards and in accordance with the spirit and letter of the Dayton Agreement&quot; before returning the transmitters back to the Pale leadership.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n285</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This intervention took place not because of conflict between different ethnic groups but because of conflict between two factions of one ethnic group - Serbs from Pale and Serbs from Banja Luka.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n286</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a sense, this was an election-related seizure of control, not a seizure directly related to ethnic conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the standard for intervention articulated in the Sintra Declaration was so broad, it is difficult to determine when radical intervention - beyond monitoring - was justified. In examining the evolution of the standard &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*104]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in subsequent statements, it became clear that the standard of objective and impartial reporting and the standard that justified the imposition of an international protectorate on SRT Pale shifted. Broadcasts that persistently and blatantly contravented Dayton became a new basis for OHR intervention in Bosnia.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n287</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While this justification did not deal with incitement to ethnic violence, the OHR considered contravention of Dayton to be a per se increase in the likelihood of ethnic conflict. The standard for ongoing behavior was presented as consensual and emerged from the parties to the potential conflict, not as a law of standards imposed by the international community itself. It was also clear that &quot;contravention of the spirit of the agreement&quot; was found when the Sfor's authority was thought to be undermined,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n288</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or the media questioned the integrity of the Peace Process in ways considered inflammatory.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n289</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. Comprehensive Media Reform<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The OHR may have recognized its failure to provide clear and consistent guidelines to the media actors in Bosnia when it decided to comprehensively reform the entire media regulatory regime in Bosnia.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n290</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It created an entire framework with objective standards and a mechanism to determine whether a media violation occurred and the proper sanction for each violation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n291</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In terms of intervention, such a reform might be far more radical than isolated transmitter seizures. The seizures were episodic responses to unique and specific circumstances.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n292</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reform, in contrast, sought to put into place a new legal system with tribunals, enforcement mechanisms, and licensing agencies.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n293</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It attempted to reshape the entire broadcasting system in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, &quot;the control of the media by individual political parties,&quot; an obstacle that &quot;bedeviled ... efforts to re-establish civil society in Bosnia,&quot; served to hamper the OHR's reforms.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n294</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OHR needed to reconstruct a fundamentally altered media that was neither &quot;ethnically based&quot; nor &quot;directly or indirectly associated to the main mono-ethnic political parties.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n295</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethnically-based media had resulted in &quot;enmities which precipitated the war [being] fought out over the airwaves.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n296</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reforming &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*105]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;the whole media landscape in [Bosnia-Herzegovina was] a vital prerequisite for progress in the implementation of Dayton.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n297</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of this element of intervention, the OHR statements provide a sense of the aims of the international community and the aims of the parties to the Dayton Accords. According to one document, the aims of the OHR included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Establishing, country-wide, a regulatory regime equating to models operating in other democratic, plural societies. This will be responsible for establishing and enforcing arrangements for fair and equitable access to the electronic media for the full range of opinion. This will be a transitional arrangement, and will remain in place until the [Bosnia-Herzegovina] common institutions establish a satisfactory regulatory regime to replace it under the Media Law, now under consideration. (italics in original)  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n298</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> With respect to the wholesale reform, the OHR wanted to create a &quot;single regulatory body,&quot; chaired by an international judge and composed of representatives of the principal international agencies.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n299</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This body was granted the power to recommend sanctions (to be implemented by the MSAG) and to issue and withdraw licenses for all existing broadcasting entities.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n300</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The concept of wholesale reform was set forth in further detail by the OHR in early 1998 when the international community sought assistance in implementing the Bosnian media reform package.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n301</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OHR announced that it wanted to build an Intermediate Media Standards and Licensing Commission with the power to regulate all media in Bosnia.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n302</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This Commission was to absorb the election-related functions of the Media Experts Commission  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n303</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and would require all broadcasters to meet a set of &quot;internationally recognized standards of broadcasting&quot; in order to obtain a license.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n304</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OHR expected to create a judicial body with &quot;powers of sanction to ensure compliance&quot; with the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*106]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rulings of the Commission.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n305</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International experts and Bosnian representatives from both the Federation and Republika Srpska would staff the Commission.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n306</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This new reform was based on a December 1997 proposal to the OHR.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n307</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to this proposal, the Intermediate Commission would remain in operation until institutions that could perform the functions of the Intermediate Commission were in place at the national entity or canton levels.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n308</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposal justified this comprehensive action because &quot;monolithic control allowed broadcasting in Bosnia to be used as a means to divide the ethnic communities.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n309</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only was it true that &quot;the distribution of poisonous propaganda was a major contributor to the war,&quot; but &quot;it is still used to indoctrinate the communities.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n310</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OHR considered the Commission and comprehensive legal reform necessary to avoid a situation where the media &quot;emphasized separatism&quot; and thus &quot;held back the peace process.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n311</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the OHR felt that the systemic and structural problems of the existing media model in Bosnia were so pervasive, it observed that restructuring all media, particularly broadcast media, in accordance with internationally accepted standards was the only way to achieve &quot;pluralism and inter-entity broadcasting.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n312</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new system would include &quot;codes of conduct for program content,&quot; modeled on &quot;the established practices in Western European democracies and in North America.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n313</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposal provided that these codes would also apply to the press and the Internet.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n314</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until state agencies were established (and approved), the Intermediate Commission would establish, regulate, and enforce the Codes.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n315</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission was to have three divisions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n316</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first division was an &quot;all-media&quot; complaints commission.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n317</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would affirmatively monitor the press and broadcast media, investigate complaints regarding violations of the codes of practice, and recommend action on those complaints it found valid.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n318</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second division was a licensing sub-commission that would &quot;establish&quot; and administer structural and editorial licensing standards.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n319</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*107]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All broadcasters seeking a license would have to conform to the licensing commission's standards.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n320</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third division was an intervention tribunal that would rule on disciplinary procedures and provide sanctions and penalties when appropriate.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n321</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tribunal would have the authority to require &quot;one or more on-screen apologies,&quot; or &quot;one or more apologies to be published in the press and on radio.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n322</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It could prohibit rebroadcast of an &quot;offending programme or its content&quot; and temporarily withdraw a license for access to the transmission system.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n323</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Additionally, it was empowered to curtail a license or revoke a license entirely.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n324</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, it had the power to impose financial penalties on either the station or the directors or principals of the station regardless of whether the station was owned by the government.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n325</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. Bosnia and the Idea of Information Intervention<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The literature of &quot;information intervention&quot; is thinner than its practice. Jamie Metzl coined the term in a 1997 essay and called for the development of an information intervention unit at the international level that would monitor, counter, and block radio and television broadcasts that incite widespread violence in crisis zones around the world.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n326</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Metzl declared that the United Nations should empower the unit to engage in &quot;peace broadcasting&quot; and &quot;jamming&quot; in the event that an information crisis erupts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n327</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The transmitter seizure in Bosnia indicates that Metzl's list of possible information intervention tools may not be exhaustive. Additionally, there are complex factors that any policy maker must take into account when deciding whether to use any of these tools as part of a general information strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most basic questions involve monitoring. Metzl thought that the international community should monitor broadcasts before taking other steps.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n328</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He considered media monitoring a form of anticipatory intelligence.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n329</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the present time, there is active monitoring of the world's media, though not on a collective international basis. The B.B.C. and the U.S. State Department (through the Foreign Broadcasting Information Service) survey and review electronic media.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n330</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Bosnian context, the OSCE and its Media Experts Commission monitored Bosnian broadcasts to determine whether the Bosnian media abided by the OSCE's election &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*108]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rules.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n331</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Additionally, the OHR monitored SRT broadcasts to determine whether SRT complied with the OHR's demands for corrective broadcasts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n332</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OHR also proposed that the Intermediate Commission have the power to monitor Bosnian broadcasts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n333</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even monitoring presents some human rights issues. Broadcasting is, by definition, a public act,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n334</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so that on the surface, there should be little difficulty in monitoring an entity's broadcasts. The systematic monitoring of world broadcasts by the BBC and the Foreign Broadcasting Information Service (FBIS) generally is not monitoring with the purpose of intervention. Rather, these entities gather intelligence for policy-making purposes.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n335</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monitoring may become problematic when the effective media is private. For example, monitoring encrypted web sites or closed list web sites presents significant privacy and free speech issues.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n336</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monitoring in such circumstances may become more complex and intrusive.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n337</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposed Intermediate Commission in Bosnia included Internet communications within its sweep of supervision.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n338</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The apparent innocuousness of monitoring may turn on the nature of the agency that engages in it, but the international community needs to develop concrete standards to help any agency determine when such action is appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second element - alternative or &quot;peace broadcasting&quot; - was evident, but not always successful in Bosnia. Peace broadcasting has many elements. Intervention to provide &quot;more speech&quot; is generally acceptable and widely applauded by guardians of the press and citizenship.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n339</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Acclaim, however, may be limited when those in power use peace broadcasting to force an entity to broadcast corrective statements or explanations of official positions. This type of information intervention took place in Bosnia.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n340</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The purpose, however, of the OHR's use of this intervention was to provide alternate voices to SRT Pale.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n341</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bosnian case suggests further distinctions among efforts at peace broadcasting. In Bosnia, the international community established an alternative broadcast network and stitched together a network of existing independent stations to create an alternative to SRT Pale.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n342</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By reinforcing &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*109]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  media independent of hard line voices, the international community ensures that views in accord with a plural and constitutional future are broadcast to the state in question. Finally, the Bosnian experience raises questions about the use of foreign governmental funds in creating alternate voices.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n343</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many argue that support only goes to those portions of the press that are inclined favorably to the donor's point of view.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n344</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other issues are more specific. For example, should the international community have provided more assistance to Bosnian public service broadcasters? Dr. Reino Paasilinna, a media policy scholar and Member of the European Parliament for Finland, attacked the OHR for supporting commercial broadcasting at the expense of public service radio and television in Bosnia.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n345</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Paasalinna also criticized the international community for expending millions of dollars to create and support the OBN as a commercial competitor of TVBiH.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n346</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the information intervention scale, jamming represents a more severe form of intervention as compared to monitoring or peace broadcasting.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n347</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, the international legal principles that would or would not authorize jamming may be quite different than those that deal with the seizure of transmitters or other steps to curtail or preclude broadcasts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n348</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bosnian experience demonstrates the controversy and difficulty of jamming even when legally justified. Sfor and the OHR were subject to great criticism in their home countries for jamming SRT Pale broadcasts. As the SRT and HTV Mostar experiences indicate, however, an information intervention unit of the future would likely jam broadcasts by &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*110]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  affecting transmission paths rather than physically interfering with the facilities of an offending station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is one element of information intervention not apparent in the literature that was critical in the Bosnian context. In Bosnia, the international community reconstructed the media regime and relicensed all existing broadcasters. Ultimately, legal reform plays a key part in legitimizing change and, perhaps, in facilitating change. Law becomes the vehicle for articulating goals and establishing the machinery for meeting those goals. In Bosnia, the OHR found it necessary to develop a framework that was clear, transparent, and available to all the actors in the region in order to create a pluralistic media.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n349</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bosnian experience also demonstrates that information intervention, like any aspect of international intervention, is a complex managerial undertaking that involves meshing the needs of conflicting international agencies and non-government organizations with the needs of the state and the various entities that comprise the state. It requires that the international community establish a bureaucracy that (1) can determine under what conditions an intervention is needed and (2) can designate and fulfill the intervention. The Bosnian experience demonstrated that such a bureaucracy needs individuals prepared to deal with the technical aspect of intervention to make sure that the intervention is not circumvented.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n350</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conclusion<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The restructuring of the Bosnian media helps us understand the context, limitations, and techniques of information intervention. It illustrates how the international community struggles to define and implement intervention policy and developes justifications for initiating an intervention or increasing the scope of existing interventions. The Bosnian experience also suggests that the parties implementing the Dayton Accords lurched towards definitions and standards in the process of forming an intervention strategy. The resulting standards were often shaped by ethnocentric criticism of international officials or media policies, and thus may increase the likelihood of violence in a post-conflict context. The Bosnian episode also underscores the limited machinery that exists to provide official accountability for those officials in charge of an intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because so many of the techniques of information intervention were applied in Bosnia, the Bosnian experience provides a unique perspective into the relationship between the intervenors and the domestic media. The international community took steps that ranged from the training of media professionals to the military seizure of transmitters. The comprehensiveness of those events provides a textbook opportunity to analyze the relevance of international law norms to information intervention. Other norms, such as U.S. First Amendment principles, might be used as guidelines particularly where American actions are implicated. However, it &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*111]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would be too easy to jump from the peacetime application of such norms within the United States to their applicability abroad in time of conflict. When not reinterpreted, even the most specific subcategories of First Amendment jurisprudence ring hollow when applied to a zone of international concern. Is advocacy of imminent lawless action in a troubled area enough to justify an information intervention?  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n351</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is the use of fighting words enough to justify an information intervention?  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n352</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When do these types of speech pose a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; to the international community such that an information intervention is justified?  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n353</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Must all information interventions be &quot;narrowly-tailored&quot; and &quot;content neutral&quot; to fit within the discourse of international information intervention?  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n354</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doctrines derived from the European Convention on Human Rights also must be taken into account in shaping policy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n355</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further, examining the implementation of the Dayton Accords is instructive because it sheds light on how the international community makes decisions regarding the scope of such concepts as objectivity, impartiality, avoiding ethnic conflict, and enhancing the right to receive and impart information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international mission, as U.S. and Western representatives saw it, was to reconstruct a viable multi-ethnic media, as well as to prevent further conflict.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n356</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NATO was seeking to build, under the Dayton Accords, a plural society out of pieces that seemed fractured beyond repair. The OHR believed that a pluralistic, peaceful media was an indispensable part of the rebuilding process.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n357</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Office proclaimed its desire to &quot;use the opportunity to remove one of the most serious obstacles bedeviling our efforts to re-establish civil society in Bosnia&quot; - the fact that the media was ethnically based.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n358</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NATO and OHR actions must be judged after a reasonable period of time elapses to see if a more democratic Bosnia-Herzegovina, supported &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*112]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the pluralism that comes from a free and independent press, emerges. Still, one of the great dangers of information intervention is that it provides apparent democratic justification for any nation to use its police power to close down media outlets. Each time the international community intervenes to shut down a media outlet that it does not like, the line between information intervention and censorship becomes blurred. The real test is not only whether an information intervention transforms a society but also whether the intervention comports with the spirit of democratic change. Ends can justify means, but it is helpful if the means themselves are compatible with those ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with many complex undertakings, much criticism has attached to the idea that the post-conflict situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina was marked by chaos, too many actors, mixed objectives, and circumstances in which each country wanted its own signature of representation, even if that was inconsistent with a rationale whole. The OHR was also criticized for being too dictatorial, too directed, and inadequately responsive. Undoubtedly all of these criticisms are true to some extent. It is a characteristic of post-conflict interventions, especially multilateral interventions that involve both intergovernmental and non-governmental entities, that the perils of crisis management are present. Evolving political circumstances in the Balkans, including the maturing of institutions within Bosnia-Herzegovina, will alter the international community's perception of its role in indigenous media development. Political transformations in Croatia and, potentially, Serbia, could have as much influence on post-conflict media intervention in Bosnia as the direct actions of the OHR and Sfor. The international community itself may alter its perception of how to structure the relationship between the entities and Bosnia-Herzegovina and this will affect post-conflict media policy. And in the best of worlds, the building of an independent media sector and the growth of a comprehensive, increasingly autonomous public service broadcasting sector will combine to hasten the likelihood of a mature and stable democratic state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 31, 1998, Sfor handed the seized towers to the newly elected Bosnian government. Sfor, however, reserved the right to reappropriate the transmitters at any time.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n359</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 14, 1998, the Serb Republic Prime Minister, Milorad Dodik, and Sfor Commander, Eric Shinseki, signed a memorandum of understanding in which Sfor agreed to stop &quot;providing security protection for TV transmitters belonging to Serb Radio and TV.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n360</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The episode of transmitter seizure was over.</SPAN></P>

Established in late September 1997, MSAG's function was essentially to monitor and govern the media in Bosnia-Herzegovina to the extent that it could according to the Sintra declaration and the OSCE's MEC. The MSAG declared itself &quot;the body that provided the executive mechanism to demand the level and type of access required in an outlet deemed in violation of the...MEC. If such demands were not complied with the MSAG would then recommend escalation as necessary&quot; using the paragraph 70 powers of the Sintra Declaration giving the High Representative authority to &quot;curtail or suspend&quot; any media network or program whose output was in violation of the Dayton Accords.

<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c20">After World War II, the United States and its allies &quot;belligerently occupied&quot; Germany and Japan. Compare Sharon Korman, The Right of Conquest 177 (1996) (arguing that the Allies did abide by norms consistent with the rights of a belligerent occupier with respect to the occupations of Germany and Japan), with Benvenisti, supra note 224, at 91-93 (pointing out that in Germany, at least, the Allies were not occupiers in the sense conceived of by the Hague Regulations, but instead saw themselves as having assumed complete sovereignty over Germany). The Allies aimed, inter alia, to refashion the radio broadcasting systems in Germany and Japan. See Donna E. Arzt, Nuremberg, Denazification and Democracy: The Hate Speech Problem at the International Military Tribunal, 12 N.Y.L. Sch. J. Hum. Rts. 689, 727-31 (1995) (reviewing Telford Taylor, The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir (1993)). This objective was part of the larger mission of the Occupation in constructing a democratic society in the former Axis nations. See Benvenisti, supra note 224, at 91. To do that, the United States and its allies imposed a legal regime that provided a mechanism to transform existing media outlets in both countries. See Military Government Regulations, tit. 21, pt. 5 (1949), reprinted in The Department of State, Germany 1947-1949: The Story in Documents 605 (1950) [hereinafter Germany 1947-1949].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c20">In Germany, the Allies forever changed the structure of broadcasting. See Arzt, supra, at 731. They split up and decentralized the dominant media outlets in order to prevent a dominant national voice from arising. See Military Government Regulations, supra, at 605. In Japan, the U.S. government sought to eradicate all elements of militarism and nationalism from the national voice. See William J. Sebald &amp; C. Nelson Spinks, Japan: Prospects, Options, and Opportunities 17 (1967). The first Memorandum of the Allies, in somewhat Orwellian words, claimed to reestablish freedom of speech and press. See Berlin (Potsdam) Conference, ch. II, sub. A. pt. 10 (1945), reprinted in Germany 1947-1949, supra, at 49. At the same time it required that news be true to facts, faithful to the policies of the Allied Powers, and refrain from skeptical criticisms of the Allied Forces. See id.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ... If the 1990s were for many a time of optimism about the efficacy of international law and legal institutions, the first decade of the twenty-first century has brought a backlash, at least in the United States. ...  But cosmopolitanism is potentially a far more nuanced theory than that, providing a framework for recognizing multiple community affiliations and multiple norm-generating entities, only some of which map neatly onto the fixed territorial boundaries of the nation-state system. ...  In this analysis, international law is seen only as a product of state interest and not as a limit on the pursuit of that interest. ... Turning to their second assumption, Goldsmith and Posner start from the premise that the state can have a unitary set of interests independent of the multiple political players involved and their various personal and professional ambitions, desires, or aims. ... Other domestic examples help suggest ways in which legal norms change consciousness over time, even when the literal enforcement of the legal norm is lacking. ...  The mere fact that changes in legal consciousness are difficult to quantify and predict does not render them any less important in analyzing state behavior concerning international law. ...  Once a norm is named a customary international law norm, then violation of that norm will have far more serious reputational costs. ... &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the 1990s were for many a time of optimism about the efficacy of international law and legal institutions, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the first decade of the twenty-first century has brought a backlash, at least in the United States. The Bush administration's hostility to international law is well documented, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Republicans in Congress are decrying the mere citation of foreign or international sources in U.S. Supreme Court opinions, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and a cadre of international law scholars, seemingly motivated by concerns that international legal norms might pose undue limitations on state prerogatives or democratic processes, are arguing against the implementation of such norms domestically. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even those who are inclined to be more sympathetic to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1266]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  international human rights law have purported to show, through quantitative analysis, that human rights treaties may not affect actual state behavior. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these attacks, however, misconceive the ways in which international law is most likely to operate. Because international law generally is not backed by coercive force, it of course does not literally bind state actors. Thus, if international law affects behavior at all, it does so far more subtly. For example, it may slowly change attitudes in large populations, effecting shifts in ideas of appropriate state behavior. In addition, international legal norms may well empower constituencies within a domestic polity and provide them with a language for influencing state policy, thereby affording them leverage that they would not otherwise have had at their disposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such subtle processes may not, at least on the surface, seem to play a role in constraining state behavior. And they cannot necessarily be measured in immediately quantifiable ways. But, over time, we may see changes that are more profound than those brought about by an ephemeral coercive statute enacted by a legislature. Thus, if we want to study whether international law has real effects, we need to analyze these processes rather than limit our gaze to the question of whether international law binds states coercively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is for this reason that the latest addition to the international law backlash genre, The Limits of International Law, by Jack Goldsmith and Eric Posner, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is so disappointing. Tendentious and unpersuasive, the book deploys the simplifying assumptions of rational choice theory in an attempt to demonstrate that international law has no independent valence whatsoever. Rather, according to the authors, each state single-mindedly pursues its rational state interest and therefore obeys international legal norms only to the extent that such norms serve those pre-existing interests. Thus, they argue, international law is sometimes important, but only as a mechanism by which nation-states negotiate power, not as an independent limitation on the prerogatives of state governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, while there is certainly much work still to be done to fully study the variety of ways in which international legal pronouncements might or might not affect the behavior of state and non-state actors, The Limits of International Law advances the discussion hardly at all. This is because, as with much rational choice analysis, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Goldsmith and Posner must start with a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1267]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  series of assumptions that effectively clear away almost all of the ways in which international law and legal institutions are most likely to be effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, they assume that state interests exist independently of the social context within which the interests are formed. But a policymaker's idea of what is in the state's interest is always and necessarily affected by ideas of appropriate action, and these ideas are likely to be shaped - even if unconsciously - by legal norms, including the norms of international law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, such government officials, especially in a democracy, are at least somewhat responsive to popular opinion, and such opinion is also likely to be shaped by a variety of forces, again including the moral pull of international legal norms. As sociolegal scholars have long described, legal norms can effect changes in legal consciousness that in turn alter the categories of our thought, such that they help determine what we are likely to see as a viable policy option in the first place. Indeed, the particular brand of rational choice theory adopted by Goldsmith and Posner ignores even the insights of law and economics itself, which long ago adopted a framework that includes behavioral psychology within its analysis. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, Goldsmith and Posner assume that, in any given setting, a state actually has a single, definable set of interests. Thus, even as rational choice theory has long been attacked for its reliance on the idea that individuals have unitary definable interests, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Goldsmith and Posner multiply the problem by asserting that entire states have such interests. Yet, given that states are made up of multiple bureaucrats with various spheres of authority, political ideologies, institutional loyalties, and interests that range from the goal of re-election, to the need to curry favor with particular interest groups, to the aim of career advancement, the idea that a state could have a single interest is simply unfathomable. And that is not even counting the myriad forces outside of government - NGOs, editorial writers, campaign contributors, political </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and so on - that all exert influence on government actors and all may themselves be influenced by and may &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1268]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  consciously deploy the norms of international law in order to press varying agendas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, Goldsmith and Posner set their work in opposition to what they describe as &quot;cosmopolitan theory,&quot; which, they assert, &quot;argues that states have a duty ... to act on the basis of global rather than state welfare.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, they equate cosmopolitanism with a kind of utopian universalist utilitarianism. But cosmopolitanism is potentially a far more nuanced theory than that, providing a framework for recognizing multiple community affiliations and multiple norm-generating entities, only some of which map neatly onto the fixed territorial boundaries of the nation-state system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of their three radically simplifying assumptions, Goldsmith and Posner end up arguing against a straw man. Only the most diehard internationalists would suggest that a state already completely united behind both a set of interests and a strategy for attaining those interests will practice self-denial solely because that strategy contravenes international law. So, of course, if one starts from the premise that there are pre-existing unitary interests, it will be difficult to find examples where international legal norms appear to have any effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is ludicrous to assume that coercively preventing states from doing that which they have already decided to do is the only way of evaluating the efficacy of international law. Indeed, even in the domestic context, legal norms are effective largely because people imbibe those norms and adopt them as their own, not because a police officer stands behind the next corner waiting to pounce. And law's impact is not found only in literal obedience to rules, but in the everyday categories of our discourse. When we casually refer to &quot;private&quot; property, &quot;married&quot; couples, the &quot;rights&quot; of people, and so on, we are adopting and deploying law's power even if we are not aware of the fact. Thus, over time, what a state considers to be in its interest is likely to change, and those changes will often be at least partly the product of changes in legal consciousness, which is in turn shaped by international law. Moreover, various actors within the state bureaucracy (or those seeking to affect bureaucratic decisionmaking) will use international legal norms to craft political arguments within their own polities. Again, such arguments will, at least sometimes, effectively shift popular or political consensus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, whatever the limits of international law may be, the analytical framework Goldsmith and Posner construct will not help us find them. In this Book Review Essay, I first outline their argument and focus particularly on the crucial sets of assumptions they apply to their analysis. Then, drawing on sociolegal scholarship and actual examples of international law as it operates on the ground, I discuss two ways in which international law can have a significant impact, both of which are ignored by Goldsmith and &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1269]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Posner. First, I explore the concept of legal consciousness and suggest that, over time, international law norms may alter what both governmental actors and larger populations view as &quot;right,&quot; &quot;natural,&quot; &quot;just,&quot; or &quot;in their interest.&quot; Second, I discuss various instances in which individual constituencies both within and outside of government have deployed international legal norms to gain leverage and affect state policy choices. Finally, I take on the distorted view of cosmopolitanism used by Goldsmith and Posner, and suggest that cosmopolitanism potentially offers a far more useful analytical lens for conceptualizing the ways in which multiple lawmaking communities construct, disseminate, and negotiate legal norms than the schematic simplifications of internationalized rational choice theory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To some degree, of course, my analysis reprises old debates between international relations realism on the one hand and constructivism on the other. For decades realists have relied on the idea that states pursue unitary sets of interests (generally power and riches) and that international law is only instrumental. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Likewise, constructivists have long argued that interests cannot exist independently of social context and that international law plays a role in shaping the contexts in which interests arise. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, apparently the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1270]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  battle must be joined once more. The vision of international law that Goldsmith and Posner espouse, though newly dressed up in the trappings of rational choice theory and econometric analysis, is at bottom just the same old realist vision. And as long as theorists continue to view international relations as merely a real-life version of the game of &quot;Risk&quot; or &quot;Stratego,&quot; devoid of sociological, psychological, or even political complexity, those who seek a more nuanced understanding of international law will need to respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. Rational Choice and International Law<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The central thesis of The Limits of International Law is easily stated. According to Goldsmith and Posner, international legal norms, though sometimes useful to states in pursuing their own interests, have no actual constraining effect on states. The authors argue that states are never pulled into compliance with international law if such compliance would be contrary to the state's interests. Instead, they suggest that state behavior is best captured by four game theoretic models describing how states strategically pursue their interests in various forms of cooperation and competition with each other. In this analysis, international law is seen only as a product of state interest and not as a limit on the pursuit of that interest. Significantly, though this claim purports to be merely descriptive - presenting a theory of how states actually behave in the world - the normative thrust of the book is difficult to miss. Goldsmith and Posner clearly believe that international law should not be treated as an independent check on state action, and their argument is squarely aimed at those, both within government and outside of it, who would view international law as a constraint. At bottom, therefore, Goldsmith and Posner seek to change attitudes about international law that they see as an unnecessary drag on the power of states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, like the economist in the old joke who, in order to open a can in the forest, must first assume a can opener, Goldsmith and Posner depend for their analysis almost entirely on a set of simplifying assumptions. Indeed, their principal argument about international law lacking constraining effect makes sense only if one buys into their simplified framework. To be sure, they rightly acknowledge those assumptions at the beginning of the book. However, mere acknowledgment of the assumptions cannot substitute for reasoned argument as to why those assumptions are justified. And here the justifications are cursory at best. This Part therefore discusses the assumptions at some length and then briefly outlines the basic trajectory of the argument that follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1271]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The crucial set of assumptions from which Goldsmith and Posner begin is contained in the statement that &quot;states act rationally to further their interests.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This phrase includes at least three simplifications that are intrinsic to the book's analytical framework: (1) that state interests can arise independently of the international law context itself; (2) that a state could ever have a single identifiable interest; and (3) that states act rationally to further those interests. Yet, while properly acknowledging their assumptions, Goldsmith and Posner provide only the thinnest of justifications for employing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the first assumption, Goldsmith and Posner state baldly that they &quot;take state interests at any particular time to be an unexplained given.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, as will be discussed further in Part II of this Book Review Essay, such an assumption ignores the processes by which states (or individuals) develop preferences or interests in the first place. Goldsmith and Posner concede that constructivists have long made this point by arguing that international legal norms and institutions influence not only conceptions of what is in the state's interest, but also the cognitive categories through which the very idea of interests is viewed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, cognitive psychology </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and even behavioral law and economics </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> acknowledge the need to study how interests arise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, Goldsmith and Posner suggest first that such constructivist claims cannot be proved one way or the other. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is unclear, however, what the authors would accept as proof in this regard. As we will see, there is a large body of sociolegal data demonstrating (or at least strongly suggesting) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1272]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that legal norms become internalized as part of the categories of human thought. For example, when people think in terms of &quot;human rights,&quot; they are internalizing a set of philosophical and legal constructs, many of which are imbibed unconsciously. If true, this would certainly be an example of international law having an effect, regardless of whether such a process of norm-internalization can ever be proven. Thus, the use of the word &quot;proof&quot; here is a dodge. Of course such complex psychological and cognitive causation will be difficult, if not impossible, to prove definitively. But that does not mean that any view one may have about how interests arise is therefore equally correct. Accordingly, it is insufficient for Goldsmith and Posner to state that, since neither side can &quot;prove&quot; whether or not international legal norms affect conceptions of state interest, they can just move on as if no challenge to their framework had been made. Moreover, it should go without saying that there is nothing particularly &quot;rigorous&quot; or &quot;empirical&quot; about using game theory to speculate about how states act in certain situations, and so the implication that Goldsmith and Posner are somehow providing a more factually grounded account is unsupportable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more surprisingly, Goldsmith and Posner write that, even if one could demonstrate that state interests are themselves constructed by reference to international law (an idea they call the &quot;endogenization of the state's interest&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), such an understanding of how interests arise would not necessarily &quot;lead to a more powerful understanding of how states behave with respect to international law.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accordingly, they write, &quot;we provide our theory in the pages that follow, and we leave it to critics to decide whether constructivism provides a better theory of international law.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Needless to say, this is not an argument at all. Rather, Goldsmith and Posner appear ready to ignore constructivism even if it could be proved to their satisfaction that the constructivist insights were correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to their second assumption, Goldsmith and Posner start from the premise that the state can have a unitary set of interests independent of the multiple political players involved and their various personal and professional ambitions, desires, or aims. They acknowledge, however, that &quot;state interests are not always easy to determine, because the state subsumes many institutions and individuals that obviously do not share identical preferences about outcomes.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One would think that this fact alone would pose a major hurdle for the rational choice analysis Goldsmith and Posner wish to undertake. Indeed, public choice theory has long sought to show that any idea that a political body has a single &quot;interest&quot; or &quot;intent&quot; is &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1273]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  misguided. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet Goldsmith and Posner respond with what is essentially a one-sentence throw away. Despite the difficulties inherent in determining a single state interest, they write: &quot;Nonetheless, a state - especially one with well-ordered political institutions - can make coherent decisions based upon identifiable preferences, or interests, and it is natural and common to explain state action on the international plane in terms of the primary goal or goals the state seeks to achieve.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, this response provides no justification for their assumption whatsoever. After all, whether it is &quot;common&quot; to speak of a state having unitary interests is completely irrelevant; the question is whether it is accurate to do so. And as to whether speaking of state interests is &quot;natural,&quot; the statement is so vague that it has almost no content at all. Perhaps most importantly, what can it mean to say that a state makes &quot;coherent decisions based upon identifiable preferences&quot;? To take a particularly salient contemporary example, what was the &quot;coherently&quot; defined state interest in invading Iraq? To this day no such interest has been defined or produced, and the diverse actors involved undoubtedly had very different interests and objectives. Thus, some may have wanted to control access to Middle Eastern oil, others might have sought to establish a model democracy in the region, still others might have wanted to remove a threat to Israel, and conceivably some people might actually have believed the stated reason, that Saddam Hussein posed a military threat. At the same time, domestic political strategists within the administration might simply have been counting on (short-term) political gains from being at war. Accordingly, no account of the Iraq invasion would be even close to believable if it did not include the incoherent jumble of the players, as well as the various forces arrayed in opposition to the invasion: old-style realists, soft-power legalists and internationalists, peace activists, much of the military officer corps and intelligence community, and so on. In any event, the one sentence explanation Goldsmith and Posner provide to defend their focus on unitary state interests is woefully inadequate to justify such an important central premise of the book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Goldsmith and Posner assume that, once a unitary interest is formulated, states then act rationally to pursue those interests, an implausible assumption (as the Iraq example makes clear) that fails to account for the complicated and highly irrational ways in which policy choices tend to be formulated and pursued. The authors do acknowledge that, in rational choice theory, &quot;rationality is primarily an attribute of individuals, and even then &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1274]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  only as an approximation,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and they recognize doubts about whether &quot;collectivities can have coherent preferences.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But again, they brush the objection aside in one sentence: &quot;When states exist, people have adopted institutions that ensure that governments choose generally consistent policies over time - policies that at a broad level can be said to reflect the state's interest as we understand the term.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Notice the fudge words here: &quot;generally consistent,&quot; &quot;over time,&quot; &quot;at a broad level,&quot; &quot;can be said to reflect the state's interest.&quot; This obfuscation conceals a circularity of logic. Goldsmith and Posner are attempting to show that states pursue policies to further their interests, but here they are defining interests in terms of the policies pursued. Under this approach, we need only study what governments do and work backwards, assuming that such acts must have been in furtherance of interests we can discover after the fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, Goldsmith and Posner appear to use purely instrumental justifications for sloughing off nearly all criticisms about their assumptions. They write that just as &quot;economic theory has produced valuable insights based on its simplifying assumptions,&quot; so too their theory &quot;should be judged not on the ontological accuracy of its methodological assumptions, but on the extent to which it sheds light on problems of international law.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem with this response, of course, is that if the theory's ontological assumptions are false - for example, if conceptions of interests do indeed reflect in part prevailing legal norms and cognitive categories, and if states are collections of competing players, some of whom can be empowered by international law to pursue certain interests over others - then the theory, as elegant as it might be, is not explaining how the real world operates. Just as assuming a can opener won't help open a real can in a real forest, neither can a set of incorrect assumptions about both human and state behavior be used to satisfactorily explain such state behavior in real life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have spent a seemingly disproportionate amount of time on the assumptions underlying The Limits of International Law because in the end nearly all of the analytical action is concealed within those assumptions. Once one adopts the book's premises, then the rest of the authors' argument - that state behavior is unconstrained by international law and is therefore best analyzed as a series of strategic games - becomes both obvious and obviously correct. If State A has a unitary interest in, say, maintaining its sovereign border, and if that interest precedes and is completely uninfluenced by international law norms about boundary disputes and any relevant limits on the prerogatives of sovereign states, then the question of whether State A attacks neighboring State B may indeed be determined based on game theory. The assumptions, therefore, are a crucial predicate to all that follows. Then, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1275]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the remainder of the book Goldsmith and Posner identify four possible game theoretic scenarios for interstate interaction - (1) coincidence of interest, (2) coordination, (3) cooperation, and (4) coercion - which they then use to explain nearly all interstate relations. Below I briefly summarize these scenarios.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Goldsmith and Posner, coincidence of interest occurs if, for example, neither of two states has any interest in encroaching on the other's territory. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Significantly, in the authors' vision, the state's interest cannot be influenced by a sense of obedience to international law norms or even by a sense of right behavior toward the other state. It must instead be the result of each state deciding independently that it is not in its interest to encroach, &quot;without any regard to the action of the other state.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, the border is left in place because neither state wants what the other has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, a coordination game takes place if two states settle on a border and then respect the integrity of that border not because they are uninterested in seizing territory within the borders of the other, but because they believe that it is in their long-term interests to exist in a world in which borders are respected. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Goldsmith and Posner liken this to the rule that everyone drive on the right (or left) side of the street. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without such an agreed-upon norm of behavior, chaos would ensue. Thus, coordination is distinguished from coincidence of interest because states restrain themselves in order to gain long-term benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closely related to (and in many cases indistinguishable from) coordination is cooperation. The authors identify cooperation as a kind of mutually assured destruction. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> States refrain from encroaching based on mutual threats of retaliation. The fact that Goldsmith and Posner call such a system of mutual threats &quot;cooperation&quot; tells one quite a bit about their view of international relations. In any event, as with coordination, &quot;states reciprocally refrain from activities ... that would otherwise be in their immediate self-interest in order to reap larger medium-or long-term benefits.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Goldsmith and Posner identify coercion. Here, the more powerful of the two states simply invades and establishes a new boundary or, more commonly, pressures a weaker state to accede to the policy wishes of the more powerful state. Thus, &quot;coercion results when a powerful state ... forces weaker states to engage in acts that are contrary to their interests.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1276]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Goldsmith and Posner then attempt to explain relations between states using this framework. Essentially, they argue that states may use international legal norms as part of one of these games, but in those instances international law is merely a product of state interests, not a constraint upon them. According to the authors, &quot;international law emerges from states' pursuit of self-interested policies on the international stage... . It is not a check on state self-interest; it is a product of state self-interest.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is not to say that they think international law is irrelevant; to the contrary, they suggest that states can employ various international regimes to further their interests. For example, treaties &quot;can play an important role in helping states achieve mutually beneficial outcomes by clarifying what counts as cooperation or coordination in interstate interactions.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the bottom line for Goldsmith and Posner is that international law does not pull states into compliance contrary to their interests, and therefore international law will never have an independent valence. International law, they write, is always &quot;limited by the configurations of state interests and the distribution of state power.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is all well and good as far as it goes. Indeed, nearly everyone would agree that states pursue some conception of interests internationally and that if those interests are powerful enough, they may trump contrary international law norms. Similarly, there can be little doubt that economically and militarily powerful states have fewer constraints on their actions than others and so may be more able to violate international legal norms. To believe in international law as an independent force in international relations emphatically does not require that we jettison the idea of power or somehow assume that states will not act in a self-interested way. Thus, the four forms of interstate interaction identified by Goldsmith and Posner surely describe many encounters among states. Indeed, the fact that states rely on coincidence of interest, coordination, cooperation, and coercion to order international relations is sufficiently obvious that it is not entirely clear why they are worthy of such detailed categorization and explication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, nearly all international law scholars are likely to accept that states are not always (or even often) altruistic, that power matters in international relations, and that states use various degrees of cooperation and coercion in their interactions with each other. But it is a large leap from these rather uncontroversial propositions to the conclusion that Goldsmith and Posner reach: that international law has no independent constraining force. It is not surprising, of course, that Goldsmith and Posner would reach this conclusion because, as discussed above, they start from an extraordinarily limited vision of how international law might operate. They seem to be capable of conceiving of international law in two ways only: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1277]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  either as a purely external coercive force (picture an international police force hauling a state off to jail for violating international law norms) or as a non-force that is merely a mechanism for states to pursue pre-existing interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given those two choices, most scholars would view the second as more accurate. But an analytical framework that can conceive only of those two choices is one that is already impoverished. The assumptions with which Goldsmith and Posner begin - that states are unitary rational actors pursuing pre-existing interests - guarantee that they will omit from their framework all of the ways in which international law is most likely to have significant impact. Accordingly, they do not consider the possibility that state actors, while pursuing their various cooperation and coercion games, are influenced by norms of international law that they have imbibed to such a degree that they have internalized them as their own. Nor does the book contemplate the complex ways in which various state and non-state actors might deploy the rhetorically persuasive power of international law to influence the way that states play these games. Thus, Goldsmith and Posner have first constructed a straw man version of international law - a lumbering positivist enforcer of international moral discipline - that almost no one believes exists and then dispatched this straw man to the dust bin while suggesting that they have therefore said something meaningful about the limits of international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remainder of the book then attempts to &quot;demonstrate&quot; the limits of international law by looking at specific examples of state behavior. In particular, Goldsmith and Posner examine customary international law and essentially conclude that there is no such thing. Rather, they point to instances when states have not followed the so-called universal norms of customary law and suggest that the actual patterns of state behavior reflect the various bilateral games discussed above rather than obedience to customary international legal principles. Then they examine treaties, which they suggest are more effective than customary international law norms because treaties provide a forum to negotiate and establish what will count as coordination and cooperation among states. In addition, the various institutions associated with the ratification and monitoring of these treaties provide information that can contribute to this coordination and cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, even with regard to treaties, they argue against the idea that such treaties have any normative force, outside of the willingness of states to back such treaties with coercive force. Thus, for example, Goldsmith and Posner acknowledge that the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has had some success in trying war criminals, including Slobodan Milosevic, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but they argue that &quot;it was not the gravitational pull of the ICTY charter that lured these defendants to The Hague. Rather, it was NATO's (and primarily American) military, diplomatic, and financial &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1278]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  might.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, to the extent that part of the reason for the mobilization of this military, diplomatic, and financial might was the perception that Milosevic's regime was violating international law, then it is difficult to see how this is an argument against international law's force. Indeed, Goldsmith and Posner state that the United States has consistently threatened to withhold foreign aid to the successor regimes in the Balkans unless they turn over war criminals to the ICTY. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But while they seem to view this fact as evidence that international law has no effect, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it seems to me to prove just the opposite. Of course the mere creation of the ICTY by itself did not automatically cause war criminals to be sent there. And I suppose in the positivist world Goldsmith and Posner construct that means the Genocide Convention and the ICTY statute had no impact. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it seems clear that international law at the very least affected the willingness of the United States to pursue the policies it did, which is a very significant impact. And that is not even counting the impact the ICTY may have had in Bosnia itself, strengthening the hands of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> forces and helping to turn popular opinion against him. The trouble is that Goldsmith and Posner leave out the fact that the very existence of a treaty (or any international law norm) changes the bargaining power of both the states involved and the various actors within states who are trying to gain the upper hand in internal policy debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, Goldsmith and Posner argue that the existence of the treaty is not really what causes a state to engage in coercive action. Thus, they note that the U.S. intervened in the Balkans, where it had a strategic interest, but not in Africa, where it lacks strong strategic interests, or Saudi Arabia, China, or Russia, where its strategic interests conflict with insisting on compliance with human rights treaties. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this only shows that a treaty (or any international law norm) is generally not the sole determining factor in weighing state action. And again, this is an argument against a straw man because no serious scholar has suggested that international law is automatically enforced regardless of other strategic factors. And of course sometimes (and shamefully) these other strategic interests will outweigh the imperative to enforce international law norms. But that is not the point. The real questions are these: (1) did the existence of flagrant human rights violations in the Balkans provide any type of impetus for NATO intervention (over and above any other strategic interests); and (2) did the existence of these human rights norms and the ICTY itself ultimately change the internal political dynamic within Bosnia? If the answer to both of those questions is &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1279]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  yes, and I think it is, then it is difficult to maintain the idea that international law is not having an important effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, the authors' true normative intentions are unmasked. So long as policymakers, bureaucrats, and the general populace of a state believe that international law is important, there can be little doubt that such a belief system will have a real impact on state decisionmaking. As a result, the only way for the book's thesis about the limits of international law to become true is if enough people can first be persuaded that international law is unimportant. Goldsmith and Posner are certainly entitled to make this normative argument. But such an argument should not be buried within a supposedly descriptive account of how international law actually operates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Goldsmith and Posner reject three supposed challenges to their theory. First, they argue that just because states frequently use the rhetoric of international law does not mean that they are actually motivated by a desire to comply with it. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, though this is obviously true, it does not therefore mean that the rhetoric has no persuasive power over time. Second, they resist any suggestion that states have a moral obligation to comply with international law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, they contend that, unlike domestic law, international law cannot rely on theories of consent or democratic participation to justify obedience. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, international law has no independent enforcement agent. Yet, again they ignore the possibility that norms gain moral power through means other than positivist enforcers or democratic participation. And they fail to see that international law norms are part of a &quot;world constitutive process&quot; of norm contestation and development. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, if a norm attracts enough adherents over time, it acquires a moral force because, as a sociological and psychological matter, people, including policymakers, view it as such. As a result, to say that there is no moral obligation to comply with international law is, as noted above, simply a normative argument that states should not pay attention to such norms. Third, Goldsmith and Posner argue against what they call &quot;cosmopolitan theory&quot; which supposedly suggests that states have a duty to act on the basis of global rather than state welfare. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, as discussed in Part III, their account radically limits the scope of cosmopolitanism, which potentially offers a more nuanced understanding of international legal &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1280]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  process - a far more nuanced understanding, in fact, than the one Goldsmith and Posner themselves put forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. The Power of International Law<BR>&nbsp;<BR> As discussed in Part I, Goldsmith and Posner deny that international law has any independent power that would tend to pull a state toward compliance in opposition to that state's interests. But once we unpack the idea of a state interest, we recognize that conceptions of proper policy do not simply arise in a vacuum. Rather, they are developed by human beings operating with various sets of assumptions, ideas about justice, conceptions of global strategy, and beliefs about morality. These assumptions, ideas, and cognitive categories are themselves shaped in part by what sociolegal scholars have long termed legal consciousness. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, the legal norms that are &quot;in the air&quot; at any given moment of history - including international law norms - may well affect how both policy makers and ordinary citizens think about the state's interests. In addition, given that any state policy decision is inevitably the result of a contest among various bureaucratic power centers, all of which are themselves influenced by outside pressure groups, lobbyists, NGOs, and the like, a more complex understanding of international law would need to explore ways in which international legal norms empower specific interests both within and without the state policy-making apparatus and provide arguments and leverage that they might not otherwise have had. Accordingly, this Part first applies scholarship on legal consciousness to international law. Then, it examines the ways in which international legal arguments are deployed by those seeking to influence state policy choices. In both sections, I provide examples of how international law's power manifests in actual settings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. International Legal Consciousness<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Goldsmith and Posner fall into the positivist trap of seeing law only as that which coercively forces individuals (or states) to do things that they do not want to do. Not surprisingly, their view de-emphasizes the efficacy of international legal norms, except for treaties entered into by nation-states, because such norms generally do not have coercive power to back them up. But coercive power is not the only way that law can have an effect, either domestically or internationally. Indeed, as Martha Finnemore has noted, &quot;socially constructed rules, principles, norms of behavior, and shared beliefs may provide states, individuals, and other actors with understandings of what is important or valuable and what are effective and/or legitimate means of obtaining those valued goods.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, law has an impact not &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1281]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  merely (or perhaps even primarily) because it keeps us from doing what we want. Rather, law changes what we want in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, while constructivists have long made such arguments, they have not drawn on the extensive domestic sociolegal scholarship on legal consciousness. That is a shame because legal consciousness scholars have sought to study empirically just how it is that legal categories become reflected in ordinary discourse and thought. Indeed, such scholars have argued that law operates as much by influencing modes of thought as by determining conduct in any specific case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a constitutive part of culture, shaping and determining social relations </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and providing &quot;a distinctive manner of imagining the real.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, &quot;long before we ever think about going to a courtroom, we encounter landlords and tenants, husbands and wives, barkeeps and hotel guests - roles that already embed a variety of juridical notions.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, we cannot escape the categories and discourses that law supplies. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These categories may include ideas of what is public and what is private, who is an employer and who is an employee, what precautions are &quot;reasonable,&quot; who has &quot;rights,&quot; and so on. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In short, &quot;it is just about impossible to describe any &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1282]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  set of &quot;basic' social practices without describing the legal relations among the people involved - legal relations that don't simply condition how the people relate to each other but to an important extent define the constitutive terms of the relationship ... .&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because legal categories and ideas suffuse social life, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> scholars have studied both how people think about the law and the ways in which largely inchoate ideas about the law can affect decisions they make. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n61</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sally Engle Merry observes legal consciousness in &quot;the way people conceive of the &quot;natural' and normal way of doing things, their habitual patterns of talk and action, and their commonsense understanding of the world.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These understandings are often taken for granted. This is because legal consciousness may be so much a part of an individual's worldview that it is present even when law is seemingly absent from an understanding or construction of life events. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, &quot;we are not merely the inert recipients of law's external pressures. Rather, we have imbibed law's images and meanings so that they seem our own.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Law is an often unnoticed, but &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1283]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nevertheless crucial, presence in our ideas of what is fair, appropriate, or natural. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This focus on law in everyday life </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recognizes that people interpret their experiences by drawing on a collaboration of law and other social structures. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These interpretations may be widely varied and will, of course, depend partly on social class, prior contacts with the law, and political standing. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, legal consciousness constitutes an ongoing interaction between official norms as embodied in the common sense categories of daily life and each individual's ongoing participation in the process of constructing legality. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accordingly, legal consciousness includes the ways in which individuals themselves deploy, transform, or subvert official legal understandings and thereby &quot;construct&quot; law on the ground. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1284]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We all take part in the construction of legal consciousness, even as we are also inevitably affected by the legal categories of the social structures around us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a detailed discussion of the legal consciousness literature is beyond the scope of this Book Review Essay, it seems clear that when Goldsmith and Posner complain that the international law constructivist literature lacks &quot;a mechanism for how moral and legal talk influences national behavior,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> legal consciousness scholarship provides part of an answer. And while it is difficult to definitively prove a direct causal link between a legal conception and an individual's category of thought, that does not mean that such processes are not very powerful determinants of how we think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, in another context Jack Goldsmith himself appears to have acknowledged the importance of changes in legal consciousness. In an article cowritten with Cass Sunstein, Goldsmith notes that the recent creation of military commissions to try alleged terrorists engendered a storm of protest even though President Roosevelt's similar decision to create a military commission during World War II was widely praised. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The authors take up the task of trying to explain this difference in response. In the end, they suggest that one of the most important changes from World War II to today is &quot;a massively strengthened commitment to individual rights, not only within the culture but within the legal system itself.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, they note that in 1942 the country was much less libertarian in its outlook:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Restrictions on free speech did not produce a firestorm of public protest. Libelous speech was commonly regulated, without discernible public objection... . Public opposition to discrimination was far more tepid than it is today. Nor did the public insist on what we now take to be minimal procedural safeguards for the accused. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Goldsmith and Sunstein do not delve into the question of what caused these shifts in social attitudes, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but it seems quite clear that changes in the framework of constitutional law had something to do with it. And we need not engage in unsolvable conundrums such as whether changes in attitudes lead to changes in law or vice versa to recognize that, at the very least, the changes in law reinforce shifts in societal perceptions, even among those who are not consciously aware of the actual legal doctrines they have imbibed. Thus, as discussed in more detail below, ordinary people are far &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1285]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  more likely to frame their claims in rights terms after the so-called rights revolution of the Warren and Burger Court eras, than they would have in earlier periods of American history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Goldsmith and Sunstein acknowledge changes in domestic law during the sixty years from Roosevelt's military commissions to today, they do not focus on the parallel &quot;rights revolution&quot; in international law. Since World War II, we have seen the large-scale development of international human rights treaties, conventions, declarations, courts, and institutions, along with their related monitoring bodies, NGO watchdog groups, and cause lawyers. While it is unclear, as Goldsmith and Sunstein point out, whether the military commissions are actually illegal under international law, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the crucial point is that all of this international norm development (along with the concurrent - and obviously related - rise in rights talk under the U.S. Constitution) is likely to have affected perceptions and intuitions about the propriety and wisdom of creating military commissions today. Likewise, it is striking that even the Bush administration was forced to pay lip service to the United Nations during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, if only because U.S. popular opinion demanded it. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, various polls taken in February and March 2003 indicated that a sizable majority of Americans wanted the U.S. to work through the U.N. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This too is undoubtedly, in part, the result of changes in legal consciousness over the past sixty years about international legal institutions and international processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other domestic examples help suggest ways in which legal norms change consciousness over time, even when the literal enforcement of the legal norm is lacking. Perhaps the most famous such instance is the U.S. Supreme Court's declaration in Brown v. Board of Education </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that racially segregated schools were inherently unequal. This declaration had enormous &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1286]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  importance as a statement of an assimilationist ideal, even though legally enforced segregation persisted for many years, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and de facto segregation still exists today. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, some may justly believe that the mere statement of a norm is woefully insufficient when true enforcement is necessary, but that does not mean that the normative statements are not independently important. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, as Jeremy Waldron points out, Brown's &quot;archetypal power is staggering: In the years since 1954 it has become an icon of the law's commitment to demolish the structures of de jure (and perhaps also de facto) segregation and to pursue and discredit forms of discrimination and badges of racial inferiority wherever they crop up in American law or public administration.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As one African-American man, serving in the Marines at the time, has stated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>On this momentous night of May 17, 1954, I felt that at last the government was willing to assert itself on behalf of first-class citizenship, even for Negroes. I experienced a sense of loyalty that I had never felt before. I was sure that this was the beginning of a new era of American democracy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Even though the federal government's commitment to ending segregation lagged over the next ten years, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the sentiments expressed by this man indicate the psychological effects of even a legal statement that is not enforced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, while it is, of course, &quot;impossible to gauge the specific consequences of any given court decision, given that such decisions occur &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1287]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  within a larger social context,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brown generated optimism within activists in the civil rights </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and helped provide them with an additional platform. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As one commenter has noted, &quot;one of the major consequences of the Brown decision was that it was a catalyst for hope and mobilization, rousing the most vigorous and sustained </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for change ever mounted in the United States.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, in the ten years following Brown, civil rights activity was extraordinary, culminating in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And while it is possible to debate the degree to which legal decisions such as Brown reflect societal change or help cause such change, there can be little doubt that Brown was, at the very least, an inspiration to other mobilizing groups, such as women, homosexuals, the elderly, and the disabled. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the change in racial attitudes - at least as expressed in opinion polls - since Brown is extraordinary. In 1954, when the case was decided, 55% of Americans approved of the decision and 40% disapproved. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forty years later, 87% approved and 11% disapproved. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Likewise, in 1942, 68% of the American public supported racially segregated schools; by 1985 that number had dropped to 7%. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the decades since Brown have brought an American consensus in favor of equal access to jobs not only for African Americans but for all groups. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As one sociologist has observed, these changes have been &quot;large, steady, and sweeping.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, such changes have not eradicated racism (though they may have pushed it underground), nor are they all directly attributable to Brown, but it seems clear that, whatever the combination of causes, there has been a shift in legal consciousness since the Brown decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1288]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Similar changes can be seen elsewhere in domestic law. For example, prior to the enactment of laws protecting battered women, acts of domestic violence such as marital rape had not been viewed as serious social problems, let alone crimes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Efforts to criminalize such behavior therefore symbolically indicated that the criminal justice system was beginning to take violence against women seriously. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most importantly, wife abuse was moved out of the private sphere and into public awareness. Indeed, the mere idea that spousal abuse might actually be a crime rather than a private dispute is a significant change. Thus, the criminal justice system now incorporates, at least to some extent, feminist ideas about domestic violence into its standard understanding of violence between males and females.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, sexual harassment law has brought about large attitudinal shifts that go far beyond the literal legal requirements. For example, corporations responding to the threat of Title VII have introduced major institutional changes that have altered many aspects of workplace culture. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, male-female relations in the workplace now reflect internalized norms against sexual harassment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One can dispute whether the impacts have been good or bad, but it is difficult to deny them altogether. And while feminists and religious conservatives may debate the wisdom of the no-fault divorce revolution, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> neither side seriously disputes that the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1289]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  change in divorce laws has helped alter cultural attitudes about marriage and divorce over the past three decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true, as mentioned previously, that these various changes cannot ever be traced solely to changes in legal norms. Indeed, in all of these cases, the legal changes occurred alongside social and political changes, and disentangling which caused which would be an impossible (and fruitless) effort. Moreover, there are also instances when changes in law do not appear to have affected either actions or attitudes on the ground. Perhaps most famously, Stewart Macaulay's study of contractual relations seems to indicate that changes in contract law doctrine had no impact on the form contracts used all the time by repeat players in the manufacturing sector, who relied on more informal sanctions to encourage contract compliance and who never envisioned going to court over a contract dispute in any event. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of these sorts of limitations, constructivism has sometimes been criticized for lacking analytical rigor, and it has not been very successful in developing a framework that would allow one to predict in advance when a legal regime is likely to shape attitudes, interests, and consciousness, and when it is not. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, Goldsmith and Posner would likely argue that the inability to predict when international law will affect state decisions and when it will not renders it useless as a tool for discussing international relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet there is no reason to sacrifice a richer understanding of empirical phenomena just because one wants the supposed clarity of a distortingly simplified framework. The mere fact that changes in legal consciousness are difficult to quantify and predict does not render them any less important in analyzing state behavior concerning international law. Indeed, there are simply too many instances when we do see state actors internalize the norms of international law to dismiss them as flukes or explain them away as mere strategic behavior. Perhaps the best-known example of a change in international legal consciousness concerns the very idea of crimes against humanity. At the time of the Nuremberg prosecutions, it was not at all clear that the pre-war atrocities committed by the German government against German citizens constituted an international crime punishable outside Germany itself. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, the statute of the Nuremberg tribunal and the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1290]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  decisions of the tribunal itself effectively established such a crime. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then, subsequent to Nuremberg, almost every state for the first time voluntarily subjected itself to the Genocide Convention, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> further enshrining the idea that individuals might have international rights against their own nation-states. Today, this idea is sufficiently well accepted that we commonly see international prosecutions for crimes against humanity committed within state borders, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the International Criminal Court has jurisdiction over such crimes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Significantly, though the U.S. has not ratified the International Criminal Court statute, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the basic idea of a crime against &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1291]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  humanity under international law is no longer seriously in doubt, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> signifying an important shift from World War II to the present day. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, there is evidence that even military officers, who might be supposed to resist any limits on their strategic behavior, may come to imbibe and espouse international norms. For example, in the U.S. military, every proposed bombing target is vetted by lawyers who work to ensure that the minimum possible collateral damage is created, in accordance with international law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Likewise, military lawyers and current and former military officers have been among the loudest opponents of the Bush administration's lack of concern for abiding by the Geneva Conventions in detaining and interrogating terrorism suspects. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These acts are not &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1292]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  explainable simply by suggesting that this is a &quot;cooperation game&quot; where military officers wish to obey international law solely to ensure that U.S. targets or captured soldiers in the future are treated similarly. Instead, it seems clear that these officials have internalized the values of international law and see them as part of what is required, both morally and strategically. Similarly, in the environmental context, we have seen multinational corporations supporting the Kyoto protocol on global climate change, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> either because they want to take part in the growing international trade in pollution credits, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or because they seek future profits from investments in renewable energy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such activities suggest that corporations, through the mechanism of capitalist self-interest, have come to internalize (and seek profit from) an international environmental norm. Further, such norm internalization by nongovernmental entities can in turn influence governmental actors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, obedience to international legal norms, even if sometimes detrimental to state interests in the short term - because one is restrained from taking certain actions - may further state interests in the longer term by allowing the state to have legitimacy and a certain morally persuasive voice in the eyes of other states. Indeed, it is significant that Goldsmith and Posner almost entirely exclude so-called &quot;soft law&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or &quot;soft power&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from their &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1293]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  analysis. Yet it is difficult to see how a state could hope to further its long-term interests without being able to convince others to follow certain policies simply through the power of persuasion and moral authority. The problem is that Goldsmith and Posner, because they simply assume a set of interests, provide no way of choosing between these short-term and longer-term interests. As Martha Finnemore has pointed out:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>It is all fine and well to assume that states want power, security, and wealth, but what kind of power? Power for what ends? What kind of security? What does security mean? How do you ensure or obtain it? Similarly, what kind of wealth? Wealth for whom? How do you obtain it? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Goldsmith and Posner, like the neorealists and neoliberals before them, have no answer to these questions. And, even worse, their framework does not allow such questions to be raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, one can certainly find instances when international law does appear to envision itself as a coercive set of rules meant to constrain states. For example, the U.N. Charter lays out a use-of-force regime that is clearly intended to prevent states from engaging in certain belligerent acts. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And we can readily concede that states might sometimes refuse to follow such constraints - as with the Bush doctrine of preemptive war - though such refusal may carry severe consequences to the nonconforming state. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, when Goldsmith and Posner argue that such international law regimes do not, in the end, stop states from pursuing their own interests, such a statement may be true in a certain limited category of cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just as importantly, many aspects of the international normative order do not lend themselves to this type of framework. Indeed, by excluding soft law, Goldsmith and Posner limit their field of vision to the formal, state-centered international law regimes that are arguably playing a less and less important role in the transnational order. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, in many cases, it is not that the international regime is constraining states but that the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1294]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  international regime creates the impetus for action in the first place. For example:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Prior to the actions of UNESCO, most states, especially less developed countries, had no notion that they needed or wanted a state science bureaucracy. Similarly, European heads of state were not particularly concerned about treatment of the war wounded until Henri Dunant and the International Committee of the Red Cross made it an issue. Global poverty alleviation, while long considered desirable in the abstract, was not considered a pressing responsibility of states, particularly of developed states, until the World Bank under Robert McNamara made it a necessary part of development. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Thus, the persuasive power of international norms caused states to develop interests they might not otherwise have had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each of these instances, international law is shaping the consciousness of state actors, not operating to constrain them from taking actions they would otherwise pursue. Similarly, as Thomas Berger argues, in Germany and Japan today, antimilitarism is as crucial to national identity as militarism was in the World War II era. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are changes in the states' conceptions of their own interests, influenced by the international legal regime that Germany in particular has long championed. Again, the important impact of such international regimes has no place in the Goldsmith-Posner framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Goldsmith and Posner go so far as to deny that the existence of a legal norm or agreement necessarily changes the constitutive terms of the relationships among nation-states. According to Goldsmith and Posner, even a treaty exerts no &quot;normative pull.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather, &quot;states refrain from violating treaties (when they do) for the same basic reason they refrain from violating nonlegal agreements: because they fear retaliation from the other state or some kind of reputational loss, or because they fear a failure of coordination.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But once Goldsmith and Posner acknowledge that reputational loss could factor into nation-state decisionmaking, they have essentially conceded that the treaty regime does indeed have a normative pull. This is because the potential reputational loss is made greater by the existence of the treaty regime itself. The treaty effectively alters the terms of the relationship among the parties and necessarily changes their bargaining positions. The same is true of customary international law. Once a norm is named a customary international law norm, then violation of that norm will have far more serious reputational costs. This is not to say that states will never violate such a customary norm, but rather that the naming of the norm &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1295]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  itself makes violating the norm that much more difficult without suffering consequences. Again, the international legal framework changes the constitutive relationship among nation-states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldsmith and Posner respond by saying that such reputational costs do not amount to a true normative pull, and they liken a treaty to a nonbinding letter of intent, which they argue does not itself cause parties to follow its terms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, of course, that is precisely how seemingly nonbinding letters of intent do work. By stating an intent to do something, a party vastly increases the likelihood of doing it because the statement of the intent to be bound changes expectations of the parties and increases reputational costs for noncompliance. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, while the Goldsmith-Posner framework has the advantage of simplicity, we must be careful that simplicity does not devolve into oversimplification or simplemindedness. We need a richer account of how law actually operates, both domestically and internationally, than the positivist vision Goldsmith and Posner assume. We imbibe legal norms and cognitive categories even when we are not consciously aware of the norm in question. We are persuaded by legal norms even when those norms are not literally enforceable. We act in accordance with law because doing so has become habitual, not because we seek to avoid sanction. We conceive of our interrelations with others in terms of law because our long-term interests require that we do so, even when our short-term interest might seem to counsel otherwise. And the existence of a legal norm alters the constitutive terms of our relationships with others as well as the costs of noncompliance. All of these factors may be overcome in some circumstances. Indeed, people sometimes violate domestic law just as states sometimes violate international law. But in neither case does that mean that the law in question has no significant constraining force. And only by thinking more broadly about changes in legal consciousness and the complicated social, political, and psychological factors that enter into the conceptualization of state interests can we begin to understand how international law operates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Multiple Constituencies and the Deployment of International Law<BR>&nbsp;<BR> As discussed previously, Goldsmith and Posner treat the state as a unitary &quot;personality&quot; with a single set of interests. But, of course, the real world is far more messy, with a vast number of constituencies both within the governmental bureaucracy and outside it. This cacophony of voices is &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1296]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  important both because it challenges the seductive simplicity of the vision offered by Goldsmith and Posner and because many of these voices, when advocating policy positions, can use the moral authority or persuasive power of international law norms for leverage. International law therefore becomes a tool of empowerment for particular actors. These actors deploy international law arguments strategically, and may gain more of a foothold for their views because of international law. As a result, international law has a significant impact in domestic foreign policy debates because it may change the relative power of different interest groups seeking to shape that policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, although the celebrated efforts of Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon to try former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were not literally &quot;successful&quot; because Pinochet was never extradited to Spain, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they strengthened the hands of human rights advocates within Chile itself and provided the impetus for a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that led to a Chilean Supreme Court decision stripping Pinochet of his lifetime immunity. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Likewise, Spanish efforts to prosecute members of the Argentine military have bolstered &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1297]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reformers within the Argentine government, most notably President Nestor Kirschner. In August 2003, Judge Garzon sought extradition from Argentina of dozens of Argentines for human rights abuses committed under the Argentine military government in the 1970s. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, Garzon successfully sought extradition from Mexico of one former Argentine Navy lieutenant who was accused of murdering hundreds of people. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the wake of Garzon's actions, realist observers complained that such transnational prosecutions were illegitimate because Argentina had previously conferred amnesty on those who had been involved in the period of military rule and therefore any prosecution would infringe on Argentina's sovereign &quot;choice&quot; to grant amnesty. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the amnesty decision was not simply a unitary choice made by some unified &quot;state&quot; of Argentina; it was a politically contested act that remained controversial within the country. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the Spanish extradition request itself gave President Kirschner more leverage in his tug-of-war with the legal establishment over the amnesty laws. Just a month after Garzon's request, both houses of the Argentine Congress voted by large majorities to annul the laws. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile the Spanish government decided that it would not make the formal extradition request to Argentina that Garzon sought, but it did so based primarily on the fact that Argentina had begun to scrap its amnesty laws and the accused would therefore be subject to domestic human rights prosecution. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n136</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Kirshner therefore could use Spain's announcement to increase pressure on the Argentine Supreme Court to officially overturn the amnesty laws. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n137</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1298]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finally, on June 14, 2005, the Argentine Supreme Court did in fact strike down the amnesty laws, thus clearing the way for domestic human rights prosecutions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n138</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only was the pressure exerted by Spain instrumental in these efforts, but it is significant that the Argentine Court cited as legal precedent a 2001 decision of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights striking down a similar amnesty provision in Peru as incompatible with the American Convention on Human Rights and hence without legal effect. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n139</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, in the end, the &quot;sovereign&quot; state of Argentina made political and legal choices to repeal the amnesty laws just as it had previously made choices to create them. But in this change of heart we can see the degree to which international legal pronouncements, even if they are without any literal constraining effect, may significantly alter the domestic political terrain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, official international institutions, such as the U.N., can also pressure local bureaucracies, for example, by creating international commissions of inquiry concerning alleged atrocities, or by threatening prosecutions in international courts. Such declarations can empower reformers within local bureaucracies, who can then argue for institutional changes as a way of staving off international interference. For example, in the aftermath of the violence in East Timor that followed its vote for independence, there were grave concerns that the Indonesian government would not pursue human rights investigations of the military personnel allegedly responsible for the violence. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n140</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, an International Commission of Inquiry was established, and U.N. officials warned that an international court might be necessary. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n141</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As with Chile and Argentina, such actions strengthened the hand of reformers within Indonesia, such as then-Attorney General Marzuki Darusman. With the specter of international action hanging over Indonesia, Darusman made several statements arguing that, for nationalist reasons, a hard-hitting Indonesian investigation was necessary in order to forestall an international takeover of the process. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n142</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1299]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  surprisingly, when this international pressure dissipated after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, so did the momentum to provide real accountability in Indonesia for the atrocities committed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n143</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, we can again see that international legal activity (or the lack of it) alters the domestic terrain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, even in the United States, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals recently stayed an execution, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n144</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> based in part on a prior decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) concerning the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n145</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> despite the fact that the ICJ had no means of literally enforcing its decision in Oklahoma. Likewise, the Bush administration ultimately issued a directive that state courts should comply with the ICJ decision. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n146</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in the trade context, although ad hoc tribunals convened under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have no authority to directly reverse the decisions of national courts or create formally binding precedent, Robert Ahdieh has argued that, over time, we may see the interactions between the NAFTA panels and national courts take on a dialectical quality that is neither the direct hierarchical review traditionally undertaken by appellate courts, nor simply the dialogue that often occurs under the doctrine of comity. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n147</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, Ahdieh predicts that international courts are likely to exert an important influence even as the national courts retain formal independence, much as U.S. federal courts exercising habeas corpus jurisdiction may influence state court interpretations of U.S. constitutional norms in criminal cases. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n148</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In turn, the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1300]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  decisions of national courts may also come to influence international tribunals. This dialectical relationship, if it emerges, will exist without an official hierarchical relationship based on coercive power. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n149</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, there can be little doubt that local actors, outside of official government bureaucracies or judicial institutions, can at times leverage international legal norms to press causes within their countries. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n150</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, as late as 1994, women in Hong Kong were unable to inherit land. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n151</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That year a group of rural indigenous women joined forces with urban women's groups to demand legal change. As detailed by Sally Engle Merry and Rachel E. Stern, &quot;the indigenous women slowly shifted from seeing their stories as individual kinship violations to broader examples of discrimination.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n152</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ultimately, the women learned to protest these unjust customary laws in the language of international human rights and gender equality. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n153</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having done so, they were successful at getting the inheritance rules overturned. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n154</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While we might regret the fact that these women were forced to &quot;translate&quot; their grievances into an internationally recognized language in order to be heard, the success of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in accessing political power surely attests to the strength and importance of the international law discourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This same story has been replicated numerous times around the world. Assisted by a global network of NGOs and activists, indigenous </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> use international norms to influence local political or judicial actors. In June 2005, communities from across the Niger Delta filed a case in the Federal High Court of Nigeria against several oil companies to stop the practice of &quot;gas flaring,&quot; which poses severe health risks and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n155</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though nominally brought under the Nigerian &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1301]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Constitution, the complaint explicitly references the African Charter on Human and People's Rights and argues for a right to a &quot;clean, poison-free, pollution free and healthy environment.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n156</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other environmental groups seek to have sites placed on UNESCO's World Heritage Committee list of protected sites so that they can then pressure their local governments to take steps to limit environmental damage to the sites. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n157</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consumer groups organize worldwide boycotts on the rhetorical strength of rights discourse. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n158</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, many African countries, responding in part to pressure from international human rights activists, have recently enacted laws forbidding the practice known as female genital cutting. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n159</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And of course, it isn't only social </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that use the language and institutions of international law to access domestic power. Thus, transnational corporations have deployed the rhetoric of international free trade law and have used bodies such as the NAFTA tribunals or the World Trade Organization to avoid being subject to domestic regulation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n160</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of whether or not one thinks the proliferation and deployment of international norms in domestic political and legal debates is a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1302]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  good thing, it is difficult to deny the trend. Thus, the interaction between the international and the local cannot simply be viewed as Goldsmith and Posner view it: a state pursuing a single set of interests either completely constrained or completely unconstrained by international norms. Rather, as part of the multivalent, messy process by which various state constituencies vie to have their preferred policies adopted, international legal norms are a powerful tool. These norms provide a set of moral, rhetorical, and strategic arguments that may empower constituencies that might not otherwise have a voice, or they may be used by already powerful forces to protect their own interests. In any event, only by going beyond the simplistic model of the unitary state pursuing a single set of interests can we see the power of international law coursing below the surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. A Cosmopolitan Alternative<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Goldsmith and Posner reject a cosmopolitan vision of international legal ordering, which they define as the requirement that states act based on global, rather than state, welfare. In conceptualizing cosmopolitanism in this way, they join other scholars on both the left and right in assuming that cosmopolitanism is equivalent to universalism. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n161</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet cosmopolitanism does not require a belief in a single global welfare or even a single universal set of governing norms, nor does it necessarily require that global welfare trump state welfare. Indeed, cosmopolitanism is not at all incompatible with the idea of nation-states, nor does it assume that the state is somehow unimportant. Thus, Goldsmith and Posner provide a caricatured vision of cosmopolitanism. This is a shame, because a more nuanced understanding of cosmopolitan theory offers a useful framework for conceptualizing the interplay of multiple actors in the transnational system we see operating today. Indeed, cosmopolitanism may in fact offer a more useful framework than the reductionist, state-centric vision Goldsmith and Posner offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosmopolitanism is a useful trope for conceptualizing the current period of interaction across territorial borders precisely because it recognizes that people have multiple affiliations, extending from the local to the global (and many nonterritorial affiliations as well). For example, Martha Nussbaum has stressed that cosmopolitanism does not require one to give up local identifications, which, she acknowledges, &quot;can be a source of great richness &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1303]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in life.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n162</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather, following the Stoics, she suggests that we think of ourselves as surrounded by a series of concentric circles:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The first one encircles the self, the next takes in the immediate family, then follows the extended family, then, in order, neighbors or local groups, fellow city-dwellers, and fellow countrymen - and we can easily add to this list groupings based on ethnic, linguistic, historical, professional, gender, or sexual identities. Outside all these circles is the largest one, humanity as a whole. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n163</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Therefore, we need not relinquish special affiliations and identifications with the various groups of which we may feel a part. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n164</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this vision, people could be &quot;cosmopolitan patriots,&quot; accepting their responsibility to nurture the culture and politics of their home community, while at the same time recognizing that such cultural practices are always shifting, as people move from place to place or are increasingly affected by spatially distant actors. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n165</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The result would be a world in which each local form of human life is the result of long-term and persistent processes of cultural hybridization - a world, in that respect, much like the world we live in now.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n166</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, cosmopolitanism is emphatically not a model of international citizenship in the sense of international harmonization and standardization, but is instead a recognition of multiple refracted differences where people acknowledge links with the &quot;other&quot; without demanding assimilation or ostracism. Cosmopolitanism seeks &quot;flexible citizenship,&quot; in which people are permitted to shift identities amid a plurality of possible affiliations and allegiances, including nonterritorial communities. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n167</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cosmopolitan worldview shifts back and forth from the rooted particularity of personal identity to the global possibility of multiple overlapping communities. &quot;Instead of an ideal of detachment, actually existing cosmopolitanism is a reality of (re)attachment, multiple attachment, or attachment at a distance.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n168</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cosmopolitan conception of law, therefore, aims to capture a middle ground between strict territorialism on the one hand and expansive &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1304]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  universalism on the other. A territorialist approach fails to account for the wide variety of community affiliations and social interactions that defy territorial boundaries. A more universalist perspective, by contrast, which seeks to imagine people as world citizens first and foremost, might seem to be a useful alternative. But such universalism tends to presuppose a world citizenry devoid of both particularist ties and normative discussion about the relative importance of such ties. Thus, universalism cuts off debate about the nature of overlapping communities just as surely as territorialism does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cosmopolitan conception, in contrast, makes no attempt to deny the multirooted nature of individuals within a variety of communities, both territorial and nonterritorial. Thus, although a cosmopolitan conception might acknowledge the potential importance of asserting universal norms in specific circumstances, it does not require a universalist belief in a single world community. As a result, cosmopolitanism offers a promising rubric for analyzing law in a world of diverse normative voices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, with regard to jurisdiction, choice of law, and recognition of judgments, I have argued elsewhere that a cosmopolitan perspective would allow courts to look at the relevant community affiliation of the parties rather than undertake a formalist exercise in counting literal contacts with a territorial entity. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n169</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More broadly, cosmopolitanism allows us to conceptualize a broader practice that I call jurispersuasion, in which legal and quasi-legal actors assert jurisdiction and express norms even without literal enforcement power. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n170</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These actors draw on epistemic community affiliations to persuade others to enforce their judgments or normative statements. As constructivists have recognized, &quot;normative claims become powerful and prevail by being persuasive; being persuasive means grounding claims in existing norms in ways that emphasize normative congruence and coherence.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n171</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosmopolitanism, far more than rational choice theory, attempts to capture this multivalent process of norm development and persuasion across territorial borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, though the model of international cooperation among states that Goldsmith and Posner envision has a contractarian cast, their model is strictly that of a series of isolated transactional contracts: parties see a mutual interest in cooperating and thus agree to cooperate. This is a peculiarly thin model of contract, however, and it underestimates the ways in which new interests can grow out of the contracting process itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drawing on the scholarly literature concerning relational contract, in contrast, we may come to see the agreement to cooperate as the first step in creating a contractors' community that over time begins to develop new &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1305]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  norms of reciprocity and loyalty, along with a concomitant interest in fostering and protecting both the community itself and those emerging norms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n172</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, as transnational groups work together to cooperate and solve specific problems, staffs of personnel are created, and these staff members tend to be inculcated in the norms of the group and invested in maintaining relations with each other. As a result, transnational networks of government bureaucrats, trade-promoting groups, human rights NGOs, and the like form de facto cosmopolitan communities, affiliations of people who have come to see that the welfare of their state is interlinked with the welfare of others, and that evaluations of &quot;utility&quot; or &quot;interest&quot; are interdependent. This is an enlarged vision of where a state's interest lies, organically evolved from agreements motivated by more short-term and immediate objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, cosmopolitanism need not be seen as a moral call to have states adopt global standards of well-being while denying state interest. To the contrary, cosmopolitanism recognizes the important historical and emotional pull of the state. In addition, it celebrates diverse normative orders in multiple communities and need not insist on homogenizing that diversity into one global culture or one international legal framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But state communities are not the only salient community affiliations people possess, and we need a framework to account for the multiple overlapping community assertions that regularly take place, particularly in an era of globalization. Whether we are talking about courts being influenced by other courts around the world, ethnic groups or transnational norm entrepreneurs asserting norms across territorial borders, the melding of legal norms that takes place in liminal areas, or the development of transnational non-state lawmaking, there can be little doubt that the state is only one community affiliation among many. And while a more detailed discussion of this cosmopolitan framework is beyond the scope of this brief Book Review Essay, it seems clear that any useful framework for understanding law on the world stage must examine these multiple voices. Cosmopolitanism permits, and encourages, such study, while the rational choice theory of Goldsmith and Posner reductively excludes all voices other than that of the unitary state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IV. Conclusion<BR>&nbsp;<BR> There remains much work to be done, of course, to analyze more fully the myriad ways that international legal norms may affect cognitive categories, conceptions of interests, domestic decisionmaking processes, and the creation of cosmopolitan communities. But such study will necessarily take place far beyond the limited vision of international law that Goldsmith &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1306]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Posner construct. By refusing at the outset even to consider the ways international law might affect state decisionmaking short of outright coercion, Goldsmith and Posner ensure that no possible role for international law will be found beyond simply as a tool for state self interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, The Limits of International Law is not, in the end, a descriptive account of how international law works, but a normative vision advancing an ideology of international relations realism. Ironically, though Goldsmith and Posner refuse to recognize the ways international law may shape legal consciousness, they themselves are nevertheless attempting to affect legal consciousness in the United States. They fear that the moral force of international legal norms will galvanize opposition to state policies, so they wish to persuade readers that such force does not and should not exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But saying it does not make it so. State interests do not operate in isolation from social and psychological realities. Likewise, state interests are not unitary. They arise through complicated processes of norm generation and multivalent disputes over policy. As a result, the reductionist model of game theoretic interaction among states pursuing single interests in clearly defined contexts simply has no basis in the real world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, while no one would say that international law binds all states all the time, international legal norms are part of the context within which state decisions are made, and they provide a set of arguments for domestic constituencies to draw upon in advancing policies. Moreover, international cooperation and international norms create and foster epistemic communities, transnational groups who, over time, come to conceive of themselves as bound up with others across nation-state borders. These are the processes of cosmopolitan norm development that scholars must continue to study. But in order to do so, we must expand our vision of international law far beyond the limits that Goldsmith and Posner seek to impose.</SPAN></P>

Our forces are trained in this legal and moral mindset beginning the day they enter active duty. It should be noted that law of armed conflict and code of conduct training have been mandated by Congress and emphasized since the Viet Nam conflict when our POWs were subjected to torture by their captors. We need to consider the overall impact of approving extreme interrogation techniques as giving official approval and legal sanction to the application of interrogation techniques that U.S. forces have consistently been trained are unlawful.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Memorandum from Jack L.

See Charles Lane, U.S. Quits Pact Used in Capital Cases, Wash. Post, Mar. 10, 2005, at A01.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE (CP) -- Key remnants of ousted Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic's regime crumbled Monday after the prime minister and the country's most powerful police chief resigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early elections were set for the Serbian legislature, a last bastion of the old order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Vojislav Kostunica moved swiftly to drive out remaining Milosevic stalwarts. The government in Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic, is expected to be dissolved today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just two days after formally taking office, Kostunica was also putting his supporters in charge of the country's most important institutions, including the police, judiciary, banks and state-run companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key Kostunica aide, Zoran Djindjic, signalled the new government's desire for closer ties with the United States, in contrast to the election campaign in which the opposition sought to distance itself from Washington because of public anger over last year's NATO bombing campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Without a strategic partnership with America, there is no solution for the Serbian national interests,'' Djindjic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic, who has been holed up at one of the president's official residences in a Belgrade suburb, remained out of public view Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But two of his key allies, federal Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic and Serbian Interior Minister Vlajko Stojiljkovic -- who controlled about 100,000 policemen -- both stepped down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All major Serbian parties agreed to an early election in December -- a move that could spell the end of Milosevic supporters' control of the republic's government and legislature. Given the current popular support for Kostunica, his allies are likely to win a strong majority in the new parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbia is home to more than 90 per cent of Yugoslavs and whoever rules it holds the balance of authority in the country, which includes one other republic, Montenegro. If the current Serbian government and the legislature remain in place, they could block many measures pushed by Kostunica on the federal level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbia's president and legislature are elected separately from federal posts and were not involved in the contentious federal vote Sept. 24. Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and other Serbian government leaders were elected in 1998 to four-year terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Milosevic's allies in the Serbian parliament were trying to keep the current legislature in place until the new election, despite calls for its immediate dissolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``This is a highway robbery,'' said Vojislav Seselj, Serbia's deputy prime minister who has been allied with Milosevic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``You will not get our blessing for a coup,'' referring to alleged forceful removal of Milosevic's allies from all major state institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seselj accused opposition forces of using ``lynching methods'' to force out rivals. Seselj, for the first time, acknowledged Serbia's parliament had lost control of the republic's police to pro-Kostunica forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Seselj was leaving Serbia's parliament, he was jostled by a mob. One of his bodyguards fired shots in the air and a photographer was punched and kicked in the head by a bodyguard. No one was seriously hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the streets, factories and other public places, anger against Milosevic's supporters sometimes boiled over into violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mob attacked Radoman Bozovic, a close Milosevic aide and the director of a major Belgrade trading corporation. He tried to flee from his car but he was caught and beaten. His bodyguards snatched him and moved him into a nearby building for safety. Later, Bozovic resigned as the head of Genex, the biggest state-run import-export operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the city Nis, workers stormed the state-run textile factory, Nitex, demanding the management be fired. Employees of Investbanka demanded Borka Vucic, a top financial associate of Milosevic, leave the Belgrade headquarters of the state-run bank because ``her safety is jeopardized.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbian Health Minister Milovan Bojic also resigned Monday, Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the vestiges of the old regime were being cleared away, the European Union lifted economic sanctions against Yugoslavia and offered it $2 billion US in aid to help rebuild the country, as well as lifting key </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision marked a turning point in Yugoslavia's relations with the rest of Europe and was seen as a first step toward integrating the country into the European mainstream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States said Monday it will follow Europe's lead in lifting sanctions against Yugoslavia but warned Kostunica will be expected to co-operate with the West to qualify for re-entry to international financial institutions.</SPAN></P>

The impact of the ICTY and the ICTR is not necessarily limited to postconflict peace building in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. ... Evaluating the contribution of the ICTY and the ICTR to postconflict peace building depends on how prevention is defined in the context of large-scale violence. ... The focus of the present inquiry is the long-term impact of the ICTY on postconflict peace building. ...  &nbsp; Nonetheless, the international community's policy of using the ICTY as an instrument to eliminate indicted leaders has contributed to postconflict peace building by creating incentives for political parties to behave in a more conciliatory manner. ...  While some would argue that these departures may have been coincidences that favored the peace process, the inaction probably moderated the ICTY's impact on postconflict peace building and long-term prevention of elite-induced ethnic conflict. ... &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> TEXT:<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although still in the early stages of their institutional life, the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and for Rwanda (ICTR) provide a unique empirical basis for evaluating the impact of international criminal justice on postconflict peace building. The pursuit of justice may be dismissed as a well-intentioned, but futile, ritualistic attempt to restore equilibrium to a moral universe overwhelmed by evil. Moreover, measuring the capacity of punishment to prevent criminal conduct is an elusive undertaking, especially when a society is gripped by widespread habitual violence and an inverted morality has elevated otherwise &quot;deviant&quot; crimes to the highest expression of group loyalty. Yet an appreciation of the determinate causes of such large-scale violence demonstrates that stigmatization of criminal conduct may have far-reaching consequences, promoting postconflict reconciliation and changing the broader rules of international relations and legitimacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to the simplistic myths of primordial &quot;tribal&quot; hatred, the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda were not expressions of spontaneous blood lust or inevitable historical cataclysms. Both conflicts resulted from the deliberate incitement of ethnic hatred and violence by which ruthless demagogues and warlords elevated themselves to positions of absolute power. At a volatile transition stage, the calculated manipulation of fears and tensions unleashed a self-perpetuating spiral of violence in which thousands of citizens became the unwitting instruments of unscrupulous political elites questing after supremacy. Against such a backdrop, the removal of leaders with criminal dispositions and a vested interest in conflict makes a positive contribution to postconflict peace building. In concert with other policy measures, resort to international criminal tribunals can play a significant role in discrediting and containing destabilizing political forces. Stigmatizing delinquent leaders through indictment, as well as apprehension and prosecution, undermines their influence. Even if wartime leaders still enjoy popular support among an indoctrinated public at home, exclusion from the international sphere can significantly impede their long-term exercise of power. Failure to deliver on promises of economic growth and prosperity, together with the humiliation of pariah status in an interdependent world community, eventually exacts a cost on such leaders' influence and authority. Moreover, political climates and fortunes change, and the seemingly invincible leaders of today often become the fugitives of tomorrow. Whether their downfall comes through political overthrow or military defeat, the vigilance of international criminal justice will ensure that their crimes do not fall into oblivion, undermining the prospect of an easy escape or future political rehabilitation. A postconflict culture of justice also makes moral credibility a valuable political asset for victim groups, rendering vengeance less tempting and more costly. Of course, the preventive effects of international criminal justice can extend beyond postconflict peace building in directly affected countries. The prosecution and related political demise of such &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  leaders sends a message that the cost of ethnic hatred and violence as an instrument of power outweighs its benefits. Precedents of accountability, however selective and limited, contribute to the transformation of a culture of impunity that has hitherto implied the political acceptability of massive human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent arrest of leaders indicted by the ICTY and the ICTR provides at least a preliminary basis for appraising the preventive potential of international criminal justice in postconflict contexts. A notable example is the arrest of Momcilo Krajisnik  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on April 3, 2000, by French commandos belonging to the Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, pursuant to a sealed ICTY indictment. Krajisnik was charged with war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide for his leadership role in the Serb &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; campaign during the Bosnian war. After Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic,  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Krajisnik was the most influential wartime ultranationalist still active on the Bosnian political stage. His apprehension followed the arrest and demise of other indicted Serb wartime leaders.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Equally notable, on September 24, 2000, Slobodan Milosevic lost reelection to the presidency of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and, refusing to accept the results, was forced out of office through massive street demonstrations in Serbia. Like Karadzic, he is now a fugitive, from both the ICTY and the Serbian people, facing an uncertain future. The dramatic dethronement of these once seemingly invincible architects of &quot;Greater Serbia&quot; and ethnic cleansing, has gone far beyond what most observers imagined possible when the ICTY was first established in 1993.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, despite initial skepticism as to its credibility,  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the ICTR has apprehended most of the significant leaders implicated in the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi minority. These include Theoneste Bagosora, a Defense Ministry official and major architect of the Tutsi extermination plan, as well as Jean Kambanda, prime minister of the 1994 Rwandese interim government, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit genocide.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that a mounting number of wartime leaders are in the dock or on the run, one can fairly say that both the ICTY and the ICTR have become viable international judicial institutions. The ICTY survived a potential amnesty deal in the Dayton peace process.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ICTY and the ICTR have gained financial support from the international community and surmounted significant operational difficulties, demonstrating a capacity to hold fair (if not always expeditious) trials. Nonetheless, even if all the senior accused are arrested and prosecuted, the hardest test of their effectiveness is whether the tribunals have contributed to postconflict peace building and reconciliation. Beyond dispensing retributive justice and vindicating the suffering of victims, have these institutions proved to be an effective instrument for preventing further interethnic &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  violence and human rights abuses? This consideration is particularly relevant to the ICTY and the ICTR since the Security Council established both as measures for the restoration of peace and security under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The empirical evidence suggests that the ICTY and the ICTR have significantly contributed to peace building in postwar societies, as well as to introducing criminal accountability into the culture of international relations. Both institutions have helped to marginalize nationalist political leaders and other forces allied to ethnic war and genocide, to discourage vengeance by victim groups, and to transform criminal justice into an important element of the contemporary international agenda. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the work of the ICTY has dramatically changed the civic landscape and permitted the ascendancy of more moderate political forces backing multiethnic coexistence and nonviolent democratic process. In Yugoslavia, the ICTY helped to delegitimize Milosevic's leadership, as revealed by his attacks on the Tribunal prior to his overthrow, as well as the later calls for his prosecution by the Serb and Montenegrin public. In Kosovo, the ICTY indictment did not stem the deportation and abuse of ethnic Albanians during the NATO campaign, but it has at least marginally discouraged anti-Serb vengeance by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). In Croatia, cooperation with the ICTY has facilitated steps toward international integration, discrediting extremist elements and encouraging liberal political forces to consider the initiation of complementary war crimes prosecutions before national courts. In Rwanda, the ICTR has undermined the capacity of Hutu extremists to rehabilitate the remnants of their leadership abroad, and mitigated the severity of Tutsi reprisals against the Hutu by making accountability an important and constant political factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of the ICTY and the ICTR is not necessarily limited to postconflict peace building in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Nor should the prevention of future atrocities be measured solely by the effects of punishment on directly involved countries recovering from ethnic wars. Despite their ad hoc mandates, the ICTY and the ICTR directly influenced the adoption of the statute of the international criminal court (ICC) at the 1998 Rome Diplomatic Conference. Together with the ICTY and ICTR precedents, the ICC blueprint for a future international criminal justice system, however weak and limited, has raised accountability to unprecedented prominence in the politics of international legitimacy. Criminal accusations increasingly constitute a serious political impediment to the ambitions of existing or aspiring leaders. In the calls for the establishment of further ad hoc international criminal tribunals, mixed tribunals, and prosecutions before national or foreign courts, in places as diverse as East Timor and Sierra Leone, Senegal, and Chile, one finds an unmistakable contagion of accountability. This spread of accountability reflects the early glimmerings of an international criminal justice system and the gradual emergence of inhibitions against massive crimes hitherto tolerated or condoned by the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. PREVENTION OF ABERRANT CONTEXTS: INSTILLING INHIBITIONS AGAINST GENOCIDE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evaluating the contribution of the ICTY and the ICTR to postconflict peace building depends on how prevention is defined in the context of large-scale violence. It is unrealistic to suppose that the ICTY could have instantaneously deterred crimes in the midst of a particularly cruel interethnic war in the former Yugoslavia.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hastily erected bulwarks cannot be expected to save lives when the deluge has already begun. The threat of punishment--let alone an empty threat--has a limited impact on human behavior in a culture already intoxicated with hatred and violence. Similarly, to expect that the ICTR would have brought immediate relief and &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reconciliation to the survivors of the massacres in Rwanda misapprehends the social devastation left in their wake. In both the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda the impact of postconflict justice was diluted by unwillingness to intervene in a timely way to stop ongoing atrocities. Against this backdrop, the first experiments in international accountability could not have been expected to instantly transform an entrenched culture of impunity into an abiding respect for the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illusory closure can easily be sought through the ritual of legal process. To imagine that the horrors of genocide can be contained within the confines of judicial process is to trivialize suffering that defies description. Yet the potential impact of the ICTY and the ICTR on political behavior is subtle and long-term, profound and lasting. Publicly vindicating human rights norms and ostracizing criminal leaders may help to prevent future atrocities through the power of moral example to transform behavior. &quot;Realism&quot; is not founded on the appeasement of power, and ideals are not irrelevant to &quot;pragmatic&quot; considerations. Beyond retribution and the moral impulse to vindicate humanitarian norms, individual accountability for massive crimes is an essential part of a preventive strategy and, thus, a realistic foundation for a lasting peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed conceptual framework for considering the deterrent effect of the ICTY and the ICTR focuses on violence that is extreme and unrestrained, but deliberate and systematically induced. Once mass violence has erupted, threats of punishment can do little to achieve immediate deterrence. However, the outbreak of such violence can be inhibited, and its resumption in postconflict situations prevented--because it often results from an elite's deliberate political choices. Both conflicts were the product of deliberate incitement to socio-ethnic hatred and violence--albeit within societies undergoing a volatile stage of political transition or dislocation.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through systematic indoctrination and misinformation, political leaders created an aberrant context of inverted morality in which dehumanization and violence against members of the &quot;enemy&quot; group were legitimized as purported acts of self-defense. The delicate fabric of interethnic coexistence was gradually torn apart and otherwise shameful and reprehensible behavior elevated to the status of heroism and group solidarity. The homogenization of the masses through collective hysteria, allowing for no dissent, was an expedient political instrument for leaders whose primary concern was to consolidate their power, as well as for those who aspired to a position of leadership and authority. Prevention and punishment should focus primarily on those unscrupulous leaders who goad and exploit the forces advocating a spiral of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notorious campaign of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia was hardly a spontaneous outburst of hatred. The organized and deliberate character of this policy emerged most clearly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where half of the population had entered into mixed marriages. The siege of the historically multiethnic city of Sarajevo by Bosnian Serb forces captured the reality of the conflict as a war of values, and not of peoples. Cosmopolitan Sarajevo, home of Muslims, Serbs, Croats, and Jews, was a rebuke to the ideology of sanguinary ethnic war peddled by Milosevic, Karadzic, and their ilk. The mobilization of political will through ethnic hysteria, and the elimination of rival leaders or ideologies, required the destruction of any belief that multiethnic coexistence was a viable alternative to ethnic partition. The indoctrination of the Serb public was accomplished in part through state-controlled media, the dismantling of multiethnic governmental structures, and their replacement with &quot;crisis committees.&quot; The events of the war point to a deliberate strategy for power, rather than any abstract &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; divorced from the less romantic realities of power politics. This deliberation can be seen in the systematics of carefully coordinated large-scale military attacks against non-Serb towns and villages, the internment of tens of thousands in so-called collective centers or concentration camps, the violent interrogation of suspected &quot;terrorists&quot; by the police, the instigation and indulgence of execution, torture, and rape by both military and &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  police forces, and the deportation and displacement of millions--as well as other elements of the ethnic-cleansing policy such as the pillage of public and private property, extensive war profiteering, and the perpetration of graft and corruption by the Bosnian Serb leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Croatia, President Franjo Tudman's reckless policy of nationalism revived and rehabilitated Ustasa fascist symbols, a senseless provocation against the Serb minority that played directly into the hands of the proponents of &quot;Greater Serbia.&quot; Belgrade painted Tudman's historical revisionism and its reception among Croats as the harbinger of a fascist state in which Serbs would have no place, fortifying Milosevic's prophecy of doom and his call for a preemptive war against the Croats. In Kosovo, the Serb public was distracted once more from the corruption and incompetence of Belgrade's leadership through another war of &quot;self-defense.&quot; Resurrecting the specter of the &quot;Turkish hordes&quot; and the Serb defeat at the 1389 battle of Kosovo Polje, Milosevic took his people on yet another odyssey of collective infantile regression. A long-standing civil conflict was transformed into an episode of ethnic cleansing, a military confrontation with the NATO powers, and a losing battle for a historically vital province. The former Yugoslavia need not have suffered such a cataclysm if its leaders had possessed the political wisdom and self-restraint of Nelson Mandela and F. W. de Klerk. Conversely, the post-apartheid transition of South Africa would not have avoided considerable violence if its leaders had acted like Tudman and Milosevic, inciting racial hatred as an instrument of power and self-promotion. In the words of Warren Zimmermann, &quot;There was plenty of racial and historical tinder available in Yugoslavia. But the conflagrations didn't break out through spontaneous combustion. Pyromaniacs were required.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rwanda, the exceptional efficiency of violence allowed the extermination of 10 to 15 percent of the population during a three-month period, and culminated a process involving the complicated planning and expenditure of resources. The Rwanda conflict was not a spontaneous outburst of savagery. Radio-Television Libre des Milles Collines and other media organized the extermination of the Tutsi and Hutu moderates through the systematic incitement of the public, targeting a largely illiterate population with no access to other sources of information. They reviled the Tutsi as &quot;cockroaches&quot; that had infested the country, and the ensuing rage was sustained by the careful political-military organization of Hutu extremists. The Hutu Interahamwe and other volunteer militia systematically infiltrated every town and village in Rwanda and compiled accurate lists of those slated for extermination. Only when the Rwandese people were saturated with racist hatred and fallacies, and extremists had positioned themselves in every corner of the country, did it become possible to execute the monstrous &quot;final solution&quot; to the Tutsi &quot;problem&quot; with such exceptional efficiency. In the words of Gerard Prunier:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The death-lists had been carefully distributed to the future killers, who acted in coordinated and systematic ways in order to catch their intended victims. There was little spontaneity in the whole process, apart from some street urchins joining in the bloody fun, and everything went ahead with the precision of a well-rehearsed drill.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>This carefully orchestrated common design was the instrument by which corrupt and ambitious leaders sought to sabotage the Hutu-Tutsi power-sharing scheme envisaged under the 1993 Arusha peace accord sponsored by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus of punishment should be the prevention of such deliberately induced aberrant contexts, within which habitually lawful social relations degenerate into unrestrained violence. Once the population has fallen prey to a collective psychosis of ethnic fear and hatred, violent behavior becomes exceedingly difficult to circumscribe through threats of punishment. In this delusional context, criminal conduct that is normally characterized as &quot;deviance&quot; is transformed into acceptable, even desirable, behavior. As Michael Reisman astutely observes:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>In liberal societies, the criminal law model presupposes some moral choice or moral freedom on the part of the putative criminal. In many of the most hideous international crimes, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  many of the individuals who are directly responsible operate within a cultural universe that inverts our morality and elevates their actions to the highest form of group, tribe, or national defense. After years or generations of acculturation to these views, the perpetrators may not have had the moral choice that is central to our notion of criminal responsibility.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moral choice in such cases may be limited rather than nonexistent. Many examples can be found of courage and valor indicating a capacity for choice, even in the most extreme circumstances. ICTR deputy prosecutor Bernard Muna relates that &quot;within the drama&quot; of the Rwandese genocide, &quot;those who were close . . . know there were heroes. There were those who hid their friends, those who tried to save some of them by taking them to safe houses.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet individuals are not likely to be easily deterred from committing crimes when engulfed in collective hysteria and routine cruelty. The central issue is whether and how punishment can prevent such aberrant contexts prior to their occurrence, or prevent their recurrence in postconflict situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prevention of elite-induced mass violence can operate through both conscious and unconscious responses to punishment. Where leaders engage in some form of rational cost-benefit calculation, the threat of punishment can increase the costs of a policy that is criminal under international law. Leaders may be desperate, erratic, or even psychotic, but incitement to ethnic violence is usually aimed at the acquisition and sustained exercise of power. As Professor Ehrlich suggests, &quot;willful engagement in even the most reprehensible violations of legal and moral codes does not preclude an ability to make self-serving choices.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Momentary glory and political ascendancy, to be followed by downfall and humiliation, are considerably less attractive than long-term political viability. Furthermore, in an integrated world community, international legitimacy is a valuable asset for aspiring statesmen, no matter how remote their fiefdoms may be. Even an isolated Somali or Afghan warlord cannot entirely disregard the relation between international acceptance and long-term survival. The stigmatization associated with indictment, as much as apprehension and prosecution, may significantly threaten the attainment of sustained political power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prevention of aberrant contexts through &quot;deterrence&quot; or conscious responses to threats of punishment can be both specific and general.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Punishment of unlawful conduct can be directed against leaders who actually contemplate or are engaged in the pursuit of criminal policies and, generally, against other leaders who might be tempted absent a credible threat of punishment. In both scenarios, the threat of punishment may persuade potential perpetrators to adjust their behavior. This cost-benefit calculation has implications for preventing conflicts, and also for preventing their resumption. In preconflict scenarios, it may discourage decisions to foment ethnic hatred and violence, since power thus accrued would be undermined by international isolation and accountability. In postconflict scenarios, leaders may be incapacitated outright (by arrests or being forced to flee), and the message conveyed that further incitement and violence will incur a high political cost. The credible threat of punishment through vigorous arrests and prosecutions removes impediments to stability from the political stage, and provides an incentive for constructive political behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides the conscious fear of punishment, there is another, more subtle, dimension to general prevention--almost &quot;constructivist,&quot; if you will--that operates to prevent aberrant contexts by instilling &quot;unconscious inhibitions against crime&quot; or &quot;a condition of habitual lawfulness&quot; in &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  society.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Professor Andenaes has argued, the expression of social disapproval through the legal process may influence moral self-conceptions so that &quot;illegal actions will not present themselves consciously as real alternatives to conformity, even in situations where the potential criminal would run no risk whatsoever of being caught.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although leadership roles in preventing future atrocities are emphasized here, the progressive entrenchment of a more lawful self-conception can occur among a wider public, which could stiffen resistance to the blandishments of a leader seeking to exploit ethnic enmity and thereby reduce the prospect of renewed violence after a conflict. Even where public access to unadulterated sources of information is restricted, leaders may be influenced by &quot;moral propaganda&quot; emanating from the implementation of international criminal justice, and understand how the rules of legitimacy are transformed among international elites. Despite the adoption of numerous international instruments affirming human rights and humanitarian standards, international relations in the modern age have perpetuated a culture of virtually complete immunity. Idi Amin, Mengistu Haile Mariam, Pol Pot, and a litany of other tyrants have never been held accountable for their deeds. Notwithstanding the plethora of pious resolutions, solemn declarations, and legally binding treaties, the international community has accepted international crimes committed as an instrument of statecraft and political control. The long-term consequences of such a culture of impunity cannot be underestimated. The failure to uphold elementary international norms has created a political climate in which extermination, deportation, and wanton destruction lie within the range of options available to rulers--not only as conscious decisions, but as a subliminal conception of viable conduct. Impunity erodes the inhibitions and restraints against such behavior, permitting an amoral account of raison d'etat. Reversing this entrenched culture of impunity is a gradual and incremental process. By instilling such unconscious inhibitions in the international community over time, and gradually but definitively transforming the rules for the exercise of power, a new reality of habitual lawfulness may take root and develop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. YUGOSLAV ANOMALIES: WHITHER THE WORSHIP OF NATIONALIST SAVIORS?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus of the present inquiry is the long-term impact of the ICTY on postconflict peace building. Has the ICTY contributed to the stigmatization and marginalization of ultranationalist leaders and ideologies allied with ethnic hatred and violence? Or have indicted leaders been supported by local political institutions in an expression of ethnic solidarity? Has the broader public distanced itself from indicted leaders despite a common ethnic affiliation? Or has indictment only reinforced the martyred image of nationalist saviors, and the ICTY been dismissed as an illegitimate institution?<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The Arrest of Krajisnik</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of Momcilo Krajisnik's arrest is an excellent subject for this empirical analysis because of Krajisnik's central role in the leadership of the Bosnian Serb Republic (Republika Srpska) both during and after the Bosnian war. The relative indifference of most Serbs to the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arrest illustrates the ICTY's effect on peace building--discrediting the remnants of wartime ultranationalism and preventing the resumption of interethnic conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest of Krajisnik brought a surprisingly mild reaction, which demonstrates how dramatically the rules of political engagement have changed in post-Dayton Bosnia. Through the agency of the ICTY, association with the wartime leadership responsible for the criminal policy of ethnic cleansing has become a serious political liability. Moderation of the postconflict political configuration has thus been greatly facilitated. Many would have imagined that, in view of his immense political significance in Bosnian politics, the arrest of Krajisnik would have generated a vigorous response by the Serb public, as well as by the Serb political establishment. The Serb Democratic Party (SDS), which counted him as a founder and influential member, paid tribute to Krajisnik as a &quot;symbol of Serb political will, articulated through the People's Assembly,&quot; having served as a key leader in separating Republika Srpska from Bosnia and linking it to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fearing the creation of an SDS martyr, a moderate Bosnian Serb politician remarked that the arrest might play into the hands of the extremists and &quot;radicalise the political environment.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition Serbian Renewal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Belgrade also issued a statement claiming that the arrest &quot;will strengthen the anti-European feelings of the citizens, and encourage the local extremists there as well as extreme forces in Serbia and Montenegro.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But despite these pessimistic prognoses, Krajisnik's arrest generated remarkably little reaction, save the usual polemics and platitudes. Protests from Bosnian Serb parties across the political spectrum seemed to express a sense of obligation more than genuine concern about Krajisnik's elimination from the political stage. The arrest provoked neither riots or reprisals against SFOR troops nor significant polarization of the elections. According to one source, Krajisnik's arrest &quot;had no major impact on the electorate. For instance, the [more moderate] Serb democrats have scored a clear-cut victory in Banja Luka, where Krajisnik was never popular.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the contest for the loyalty of Bosnian Serbs is far from over, the relative indifference to the arrest of Krajisnik suggests that once-powerful SDS leadership figures may be closer to the margins of the political stage. The Bosnian Serbs were so indifferent to this arrest that notorious Belgrade ultranationalist leader Vojislav Seselj was moved to condemn their inaction. Seselj protested that the Serbian Radical Party is</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>amazed by the Serb Democratic Party and its current leadership. They behave as if they were in collusion with NATO. Instead of organizing protest rallies throughout the [Republika Srpska], blocking traffic, preventing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of NATO troops, arresting NATO officers and demanding to exchange them for Krajisnik and other Serbs who have been taken to The Hague, they are convincing the people that they should remain cool and calm.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>In response to Seselj's call to arms, the Serbian Radical Party proposed that the Republika Srpska National Assembly formally condemn Krajisnik's arrest. But even this purely symbolic condemnation failed to attract the necessary majority. Representatives of moderate political parties, both Muslim and Serb, denounced the proposal as &quot;anti-Dayton&quot; since the Dayton Agreement requires cooperation with the ICTY.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (&quot;Anti-Dayton&quot; statements are grounds for the disqualification of appointed or elected officials from office.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to the skeptical prognosis of a unified Serb response to the arrest of a nationalist &quot;savior&quot; by &quot;outside enemies,&quot; the arrest actually became part of the internal power struggle &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  among Bosnian Serb leaders. Initially, Republika Srpska's prime minister and moderate leader Milorad Dodik was quick to say that he bore &quot;no responsibility&quot; for the arrest, which was portrayed by the SDS as a betrayal of the Serb people. Dodik suggested that the SDS &quot;is just using all available means to disqualify political opponents. I still believe that the SDS is detrimental to the Serb Republic and that we should see its political end.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few weeks later, Dodik displayed little concern in distancing himself from SFOR arrests of Bosnian Serb leaders. During an official visit to the ICTY in The Hague, he pledged the cooperation of Republika Srpska, and made the remarkable suggestion that Karadzic and Mladic should be arrested by international forces.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part of Dodik's strategy was to redefine the Bosnian Serb national interest and put into question the strident nationalism of the SDS. After the commemoration of the fifth anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre in July 2000, Dodik explained:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>There were events in the nationalist euphoria that the nation in whose interests they happened cannot be proud of. The people who committed the crimes are personally responsible for them, and I think they must be held responsible for them before the court. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c26"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c26"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. . . One of them [General Radoslav Krstic] is in The Hague already.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The international policy of discrediting wartime leaders, and the criminalization of the former leadership of Republika Srpska by the ICTY, have allowed new leaders such as Dodik to emerge and to make statements that would have constituted political suicide in another context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more exceptional is the political posture of the SDS itself, despite its condemnation of Krajisnik's arrest as a weapon against Prime Minister Dodik. Though still engaging in strong rhetoric, the SDS appears to be increasingly distancing itself from Radovan Karadzic, its founder and the former president of Republika Srpska, in order to claim a new, more moderate image. Association with a leader indicted by the ICTY has become perceived as an impediment to exercising power. Mirko Sarovic, a leading SDS official and deputy president of Republika Srpska, has emphasized that &quot;Radovan Karadzic no longer leads&quot; the SDS, &quot;nor is he in any way influencing its leaders. We want to build an open party, a party that does not scare anyone and we are prepared to fight for its new legitimacy and image.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few would have imagined that Karadzic, the principal architect of the SDS, would become a liability to the party. Commentators have observed that &quot;since Karadzic withdrew from political life in September 1996&quot; because of his indictment by the ICTY, &quot;the SDS has tried to present itself as a party which departed from the 'chains of dogma of the past'--its campaign during [the April 2000] local elections.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, the SDS finds itself doing the unthinkable: calling for the return of Muslim and Croat refugees, and interethnic reconciliation. In the words of SDS leader Dragan Kalinic: &quot;We have both the political and moral obligation to . . . work on building reconciliation and trust in our relationship with the other two people[s] in Bosnia,&quot; and to this end Kalinic proposed the establishment of a commission for truth and reconciliation.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SDS has maintained its political ascendancy but has still witnessed a gradual electoral shift away from nationalist policies and the erosion of its power, apparently because of the postwar disillusionment of the impoverished Bosnian Serb population and the high cost of international isolation. By necessity, the post-Dayton SDS has reinvented itself as a moderate force, and ICTY indictments and arrests appear to have directly affected the personalities of this newfound &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  moderation. &quot;Observers in Banja Luka and Pale say that the victorious faction in the party is not under Belgrade's control the way the SDS used to be while Momcilo Krajisnik had a main say [prior to his arrest].&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The removal of Krajisnik &quot;also means that the Serb democrats will be far more willing to cooperate [with the more moderate SDS] than before.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not suggested that a mechanical cause and effect operates between ICTY indictments and the moderation of Bosnian Serb politics. Although leaders such as Dodik call for cooperation with the ICTY, a significant part of the Bosnian Serb public continues to view the Tribunal as an anti-Serb institution with little credibility. Furthermore, as serious economic problems such as 90 percent unemployment afflict certain areas, people are preoccupied with daily survival and opportunities for progress. Although the situation has probably changed for the better in the intervening years, a 1997 U.S. Information Agency poll indicated that no more than 6 percent of the ethnic groups in Bosnia regarded the issue of war crimes prosecutions as urgent.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonetheless, the international community's policy of using the ICTY as an instrument to eliminate indicted leaders has contributed to postconflict peace building by creating incentives for political parties to behave in a more conciliatory manner. Without the ICTY indictments, arrests, and pursuit of fugitives, the SDS and other Bosnian Serb political parties would be considerably less benign today, especially if Karadzic and Krajisnik had been amnestied and left unmolested. One does not have to give credence to the expressions of cooperation and reconciliation to credit their effect, for the collective psychosis of the war can be undone in part by a changed public iconography. Even the willingness of Bosnian Serb leaders to yield to the political demands of the Dayton Agreement or to feign reconciliation shows the broader public that they are not omnipotent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's reaction to Krajisnik's arrest also illustrates how the ICTY can dishearten leaders once dismissive of its political relevance. According to a Bosnian source, after Krajisnik's arrest, the Serbian State Security Service assembled a &quot;team of lawyers&quot; to represent accused Serbs standing trial before the ICTY. These lawyers were specially trained to control their clients. Accused Serbs were instructed to &quot;hold their tongues&quot; and to &quot;refrain from badmouthing the Serbian leadership&quot;; they were threatened with &quot;extreme measures&quot; if they went &quot;too far,&quot; including killing their immediate family members. Indeed, immediately after Krajisnik's transfer to The Hague, Milosevic sent his own lawyer, Igor Panteli, to explain bluntly that, &quot;if he mentions in his testimony any link between his activity during the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina and the regime in Belgrade, he could expect the members of his immediate family, who live in Serbia, to be liquidated.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such desperate measures demonstrate that Milosevic could not disregard the detrimental political and practical consequences of adverse testimony before the ICTY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of indicting Milosevic on his political demise and the collapse of his rule is a matter for future review. In addition to the graft and corruption of his government, the stigma of Yugoslavia's pariah status and the devastating consequences of economic sanctions on the people's standard of living can reasonably be seen as primary reasons for the eventual collapse of the regime, through both the ballot box and massive street demonstrations and strikes. Milosevic's indictment by the ICTY for the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians was one expression of the international exclusion of his criminal state. Whether there was a more direct correlation between the opposition </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his overthrow remains uncertain. Anecdotal accounts depict the student-led &quot;Otpor&quot; resistance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as having invoked the Hague court in calling for his downfall. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies in Belgrade during May 2000, students chanted &quot;Milosevic to The Hague.&quot; According to Milorad Roganovic, program director of the independent Studio B radio and television, Milosevic &quot;lost his head&quot; because of the ICTY indictment, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which is shown by his increasingly desperate repression of the opposition, including the closing of independent media.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is evidence that leaders of the opposition fully appreciated the linkage between the prosecution of Milosevic and future chances for European reintegration but were afraid of alienating portions of the Serb public that perceived the ICTY as an instrument for demonizing their nation. During the protests leading to Milosevic's overthrow, a Belgrade commentary noted that the opposition, &quot;exposed to harsh accusations of treason continuously launched by state propaganda, is . . . intent on convincing European leaders that, because of the overall political climate in Serbia, it is wrong to immediately insist on extraditing any war crimes suspects.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To deflect responsibility for this difficult issue, &quot;the opposition leaders said that the cooperation with the Hague Tribunal should exist, but that this is the matter state bodies should deal with, not political parties.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of dwelling on sending Milosevic to The Hague, the opposition asked for Europe's help in &quot;replacing the regime and democratizing the country, while intimating that punishing war criminals would be a logical consequence of such changes. The fear arising at the very mention of the tribunal in Serbia is a result of a widespread state propaganda against this institution, which has been intensified.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This fear was further heightened after the 1999 indictment of Milosevic and his inner circle for war crimes and crimes against humanity against Kosovar Albanians, and after the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia. &quot;The Hague tribunal in Serbia remains an issue no one is willing to publicly tackle,&quot; one commentator noted, &quot;and many opposition leaders say that war crimes suspects 'should be tried at home, not at The Hague.'&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This attitude may explain the view of then-opposition figure Vojislav Kostunica, who replaced Milosevic as FRY president. He indicated his disagreement both with the prospect of an amnesty for Milosevic and with the work of the ICTY: &quot;As a democrat I could not easily justify this kind of trade-off behind the people's back [i.e., an amnesty]. As a democrat I also cannot tolerate the existence of such a monstrous institution as the Hague Tribunal.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It remains to be seen whether Kostunica's hostility to the ICTY was genuine, or merely a strategic consideration that may change with the gradual transformation of politics in post-Milosevic Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But opposition to the ICTY does not equate to opposing prosecution. Among many Serbs, it is no longer a secret that Milosevic used ethnic demagoguery as an instrument for his own political supremacy. It has been acknowledged that the Belgrade leaders indicted by the ICTY were &quot;dragging Serbia into the worst dictatorship and a long-lasting dark age.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Milorad Dodik stated after pledging that Republika Srpska would cooperate with the ICTY, Milosevic's regime in Serbia &quot;has inflicted huge damage on its people, destroyed the future of Serbs wherever they are for decades to come, . . . only its departure will allow the Serb people to regain its place in the international community.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The victims of the Serb-dominated ethnic war in the former Yugoslavia included not only Muslims, Croats, and Albanians, but also the Serb people, who had been deceived into destroying their country for the preservation of Milosevic's ambitions. This realization explains the growing eagerness for his prosecution at home. In the words of Vladan Batic, coordinator of the opposition Alliance for Change, &quot;Milosevic should be tried before a court of the Serbian people and the Serbian state, because he has brought the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  greatest evil to those people.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As with the SDS and Karadzic, even Serbia's Socialist Party is increasingly distancing itself from Milosevic to avoid political extinction: &quot;There are increasing rumblings among disaffected members of the party that the key to its salvation is ditching Mr. Milosevic.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rejecting the strident nationalism of the past, the Socialist Party's general secretary, Zoran Andelkovic, emphasized that a newly moderate party &quot;should turn back to its original principles and become a democratic party of the left.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to his assumption of power in October 2000, Kostunica explained that holding Milosevic accountable was</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>necessary to send messages saying that we are against any kind of vengeance . . . and that Serbia needs national reconciliation between those in power and those not in power. First the living Serbs have to reconcile their differences so that the dead Serbs could reconcile theirs . . . so that we can finally reach a historic national reconciliation.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>One is reminded that, as with the siege of Sarajevo, the real struggle in Yugoslavia's internal wars was over values, and not between nations. Kostunica's remarks point out that the benefits of accountability for postconflict reconciliation extend to the Serb people as well. These benefits accrue not merely from the prosecution of crimes committed against Serb civilians, or from individualizing guilt in Serb perpetrators and absolving the nation of collective guilt, but also from reconciliation within Serb society and the democratic transformation of its political culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assuming that Milosevic does not find a suitable haven outside Yugoslavia, the ICTY indictment will pose difficulties for a new government with democratic pretensions, eager to gain political acceptability in Europe. Prosecution of Milosevic before Yugoslav courts may eventually result from both internal and external pressures to hold him accountable for his acts. Depending on prevailing political circumstances, the ICTY may hold trials in the former Yugoslavia as a compromise solution. Justice delivered close to the affected societies may encourage postconflict reconciliation and emerging democratic forces far more effectively than justice delivered in the remote confines of The Hague. Irrespective of which option is eventually adopted, without the ICTY indictment, an amnesty deal between the vulnerable opposition and Milosevic would clearly have been far likelier. With the added weight of the international community acting through the ICTY, the opposition to Milosevic during the postelection transition to Kostunica's rule was greatly strengthened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milosevic's indictment did not prove a significant impediment to the surrender of power. To be sure, in the midst of the contest the coordinator of the Alliance for Change argued that the indictment was &quot;counterproductive&quot; because it forced Milosevic into &quot;a total isolation in which he is prepared to do anything to achieve his goals. Milosevic will do anything to stay in power because in this way he will delay his extradition to The Hague. He will, therefore, be fighting for his sheer survival.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonetheless, an amnesty was not necessary; widespread opposition to his rule forced Milosevic out of office. Similar arguments in favor of amnesty were made during the Dayton peace negotiations concerning indictments against Karadzic and Mladic. In that case, too, military and political realities on the ground dictated the terms of the peace agreement, and neither of the two leaders was in a position to demand a guarantee that he would not face eventual prosecution. The experience of the ICTY suggests that with sustained international pressure, indicted leaders have limited room to insist on an amnesty deal as a precondition to surrendering power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to postconflict peace building, even the UN Human Rights Commission's special rapporteur for the former Yugoslavia, Jiri Dientsbier, suggested that &quot;the only possible deal, and &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the most important thing for Mr. Milosevic is to have guarantees that if he leaves power he will not be prosecuted and will not spend the rest of his life in prison.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But his views may be contrasted with the argument of Bernard Kouchner, the then UN special envoy in Kosovo, that &quot;there could be no peace and reconciliation in Kosovo until those indicted with human rights violations are brought to justice.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beyond the implications of Milosevic's prosecution for Serbian national reconciliation and democratization, Kouchner's comments reflect the prevailing view that, if there is any hope for Kosovo to become a viable multiethnic autonomous entity, accountability for past crimes must remain an important part of the equation. It is also increasingly accepted that the attainment of this objective largely depends on deterring the violent campaign against ethnic Serbs by the supposedly disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army. The ICTY's announcement in June 2000 that it is investigating alleged KLA atrocities against Serbs has strained NATO-Kosovar relations, not least because some of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> senior leaders may be implicated and arrested by the NATO forces that were once regarded as saviors of the Kosovars from Serb atrocities. This course of action appears to be the best option in undoing a reverse ethnic-cleansing campaign by those whose political ambitions are served by fomenting hatred and violence under the guise of avenging past wrongs. The ICTY may have increased the cost of organized anti-Serb vengeance by Kosovar political elements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entanglement of NATO in the Kosovo war has dramatically transformed the context in which the ICTY operates. Although it has reinforced the prestige of accountability in policy-making circles, the air campaign has also put the independence and impartiality of the ICTY to the test. The indictment of Milosevic in the midst of the NATO campaign and the accompanying propaganda war inadvertently allowed the ICTY to be perceived as a political instrument of the Western powers. In reality, the expulsion of almost one million Kosovar Albanians by FRY armed forces, together with fears of a possible amnesty for Milosevic in a peace settlement, prompted then-Prosecutor Louise Arbour to hastily prepare an indictment in &quot;real time.&quot; The egregious scale of the expulsions facilitated the gathering of evidence required for an indictment. A more relevant question is why Milosevic was not indicted earlier for his extensive involvement in the &quot;Greater Serbia&quot; campaign in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina between 1991 and 1995. An international organized-crime investigation on such a grand scale is time-consuming and resource intensive, and individual criminal liability cannot be based on newspaper clippings and human rights reports. More important, the ICTY initially could not grasp the complex legal and evidentiary contours of organized crime at the highest echelons of state authority. This inability is manifest in the disproportionate allocation of scarce resources to investigating low-ranking perpetrators for the direct commission of crimes such as murder--i.e., crimes familiar to prosecutors and investigators in the context of domestic law enforcement--during the first years of the ICTY's operations. A similar explanation may apply to the ICTY's failure to indict Croatian president Franjo Tudman, his defense minister Gojko Susak, and former Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban prior to their respective deaths. While some would argue that these departures may have been coincidences that favored the peace process, the inaction probably moderated the ICTY's impact on postconflict peace building and long-term prevention of elite-induced ethnic conflict.<BR>&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The Case of Croatia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of the ICTY on Croatian politics indicates a positive interrelationship between accountability, the moderation of chauvinist ethnic politics, and the consolidation of multiethnic democratic forces. Croatian judicial cooperation with the ICTY became possible &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  following the landslide victory of more liberal political forces in February 2000. Stjepan Mesic was elected president of Croatia after serving as the last president of the prewar Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). His election has brought dramatic changes in favor of multiethnic reconciliation, and the ICTY has become an inextricable aspect of the struggle against nationalist recidivism. The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) under President Franjo Tudman wielded complete control over Croatian politics and the HDZ nationalist platform of &quot;Greater Croatia&quot; prevailed. Discouraging the return of Serb refugees from Krajina and supporting the forcible annexation of Herzegovina into Croatia, the HDZ took a contemptuous view of the limited ICTY inquiries into Croatian wartime behavior. A few Bosnian Croats indicted by the ICTY for crimes against Muslims &quot;voluntarily&quot; surrendered in response to international pressure on Croatia. But the HDZ's policy was to obstruct ICTY investigations and prosecutions--especially in regard to Croatia's alleged military involvement in the ethnic cleansing of Muslim areas of Herzegovina in 1993 and the events of the 1995 &quot;Operation Storm&quot; in the Krajina region of Croatia, during which three hundred thousand ethnic Serbs were displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mystique of Tudman as the visionary father of the newly independent Croatian state, hailed as the leader of the &quot;Homeland War&quot; and exponent of &quot;Greater Croatia&quot; in the incessant flow of pro-HDZ propaganda by the state-controlled media, made him a formidable political figure. His death in December 1999 ended the unchallengeable supremacy of Croatia's nationalist wartime politics and ushered in a new civic political space in which the opposition thrived. The increasingly stale and empty nationalist rhetoric of the ruling forces, the extensive graft and corruption in HDZ circles, and the mounting costs of international isolation opened the way for the extraordinary triumph of Mesic. Mesic prevailed against the HDZ in part because he was nominated by a broad coalition of opposition parties: the Croatian National Party, the Croatian Peasant Party, the Liberal Party, and the Istrian Democratic Alliance. His election was extraordinary not only because of his past association with the SFRY and the Yugoslav multi-ethnic ideal, but also because of his willingness to testify before the ICTY against both Milosevic and Tudman to expose their agreement for the ethnic partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina into Serb and Croatian spheres. Mesic showed few compunctions in challenging ideas that the Croatian public had come to favor through years of indoctrination and misinformation. Denouncing Croatian intervention in Bosnia and proclaiming the desirability of repatriating Krajina Serb refugees, Mesic's heretical political platform also called for unconditional cooperation with the ICTY. While Tudman had dismissed ICTY investigations of Croat generals as &quot;unprincipled&quot; pressure on Croatia,  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mesic as the opposition leader had audaciously countered that</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>the extradition of generals and state officials is not a topic we should dwell on. We are not dealing with generals or officials here, because a person whom the Hague Tribunal wants becomes a war crime suspect--not a general, a minister, a captain, or a shoemaker, but a war crime suspect. Besides, the individualization of responsibility is a good thing for the Croatian nation, as it would be less than civilized to talk about the collective responsibility of us all.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Despite having initially trailed the HDZ candidates, Mesic demonstrated confidence throughout the elections. When asked to name the determining factor in his victory, he asserted that &quot;the opening of Croatia towards Europe was crucial. In fact, people have come to a conclusion that Croatia's isolation damages Croatia only, and that there will be no steps forward if it stays this way.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His gamble on international cooperation and transparent government, including support of the ICTY, paid off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In another unusual demonstration of enlightened politics, Mesic has indicated that Croatia should renounce all territorial claims and ambitions in Bosnia: &quot;Croatia cannot finance the army in the territory of another country, Croatia cannot pay for the remaining of a quasi-state [i.e., the Bosnian Croatian entity of Herceg-Bosna], because all of that is nothing else but interfering into [Bosnian] internal affairs.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Closer to home, he has also insisted that Croatia should &quot;encourage our former Serb fellow citizens who fled during the confusing developments in the Serbian-Croatian war . . . to return to their native towns, grant them their minority rights, the right to use their language and give them their share in our country's economic prosperity.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has tied this policy of interstate and multiethnic reconciliation and respect for the rule of law to accountability for past crimes, including both cooperation with the ICTY and national trials. Cooperation with the ICTY serves Croatia's national interest, he says, as a means of distancing the Croatian nation, and indeed other Balkan peoples, from collective demonization because of the criminal deeds of their self-proclaimed nationalist saviors: &quot;The Hague tribunal is an institution that individualized war crimes and does not condemn an entire people as such. Modern Europe, to which the Croats, Albanians, Bosnians and Serbs belong, does not approve of collective guilt.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serb leaders in Croatia such as Milorad Pupovac have responded to this new political culture with delight and disbelief, saying that they feel they can breathe once again.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesic's political initiative did not come without costs. Remnants of the HDZ nationalists and other more extreme groups strongly oppose cooperation with the ICTY, which they portrayed as &quot;the general criminalisation and satanisation&quot; of the &quot;Homeland War&quot; against the Serbs.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The volatility of this issue was demonstrated in the Croatian House of Representatives when HDZ members interrupted a session, apparently insulted by a government minister's suggestion that &quot;during the Homeland War crimes had been committed by the Croat side as well.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a veterans' rally in the city of Split, demonstrators combined Ustasa fascist salutes with insults of President Mesic, warning that &quot;if our wartime generals are removed, the ruin of Croatia becomes inevitable.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cooperation with the ICTY has thus become an important issue in the power struggle between nationalist forces and democratic elements committed to multiethnic reconciliation. Cooperation with the ICTY serves to undermine the legitimacy and power of forces in Croatian politics wedded to ethnic chauvinism, which explains their strong reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mesic has gone to great lengths to expose the link between supposedly patriotic concerns about Croatian war heroes and the self-preservation of political forces that exploited the conflict for their own ends. For example, after the ICTY convicted Bosnian Croat General Blaskic for the ethnic cleansing of Muslims in the Lasva Valley region of Bosnia in execution of Tudman's vision of a &quot;Greater Croatia,&quot; nationalist forces organized protests in front of the U.S. Embassy in Zagreb. Mesic denounced these demonstrations. Failure to cooperate with the ICTY, he said, would mean that &quot;one would have to once again isolate Croatia and continue plundering what is left in it.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organizers of the protests &quot;are not interested in Blaskic,&quot; he said, &quot;they are interested in continuing the plundering of Croatia, and some of them protect themselves.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n61</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the efforts of the Mesic government to transform public perceptions, cooperation with the ICTY was not necessarily popular among the Croatian public in the immediate aftermath of the Tudman era. In August 2000, six months after his election, a survey reported that over 78 percent of Croatian citizens &quot;think that Croatia must not extradite its citizens if the Hague Tribunal requests it.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only about 13 percent of the respondents supported extradition, while more than 8 percent were undecided. Over 52 percent believed that &quot;The Hague wants to criminalize the Homeland War,&quot; while almost 32 percent did not think so, and more than 15 percent were undecided. Over 60 percent of those polled believed that the ICTY was &quot;unfair,&quot; in contrast to 15 percent who believed it was fair. Somewhat more than 61 percent said that &quot;Croatia should change its policy [of cooperation] toward the Hague Tribunal if the tribunal requests extradition of a general.&quot; The pollsters concluded that there is &quot;an express anti-Hague atmosphere in the country.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonetheless, the popular discontent with the ICTY has not significantly affected the ruling coalition's standing. The same survey indicated that, although cooperation with the ICTY signalizes &quot;a decrease in confidence in the Prime Minister and the President of the state,&quot; other surveys demonstrate that this is &quot;primarily a consequence of the social situation in the country and the slow pace of reforms.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with the case of the FRY, in Croatia opposition to the ICTY is not necessarily tantamount to opposing prosecutions as such. Some Croats support trials before national courts, possibly as a means of preempting the ICTY. The Mesic government has also framed national trials as a method of cooperation with the ICTY. The Croatian deputy minister of justice, Ranko Marjan, announced that &quot;the ICTY does not have enough judges and facilities to put war criminals on trial. It is in Croatia's interest to initiate and carry out proceedings against suspected war criminals.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further, to the extent that Zagreb wishes to depend on the ICTY to vindicate its claim that Belgrade committed the greater share of crimes in the conflict, it must concede the Tribunal's underlying authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the best of all worlds, the willingness of states in the former Yugoslavia to pursue national prosecutions vigorously would obviate the need for international criminal jurisdiction. Despite the broader interest of the international community in the enforcement of humanitarian law, it is the peoples of the former Yugoslavia who must ultimately assume responsibility for their past. Concurrent national trials before Croatian courts, and possibly before Serbian courts, can complement and reinforce the ICTY's capacity to contribute to reconciliation and the prevention of future atrocities. The legitimacy of international justice, combined with the greater accessibility of domestic justice, can facilitate the internalization of accountability in the political culture and strengthen inhibitions against ideologies centered on ethnic hatred and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. RESURRECTION IN RWANDA: REPAIRING THE IRREPARABLE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An examination of the ICTR's contribution to postconflict peace building and the prevention of future atrocities in Rwanda must take into account the extraordinary magnitude of the 1994 genocide that provoked the Tribunal's establishment. The extermination of the Tutsi population in Rwanda was more extreme in its proportions and impact than the events in the former Yugoslavia. About 1 million people out of a total population of 7.5 million were slaughtered between April and June 1994.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the Rwandese representative to the Security Council stated, &quot;On the same scale, in a country the size of the United States this would be equivalent to the loss of over 37 million Americans in under three months.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This scale severely circumscribes &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the potential impact of the ICTR on postconflict peace building. In some respects, Rwanda is a society beyond repair, at least for the foreseeable future. Despite the more favorable prospects for arrests there as compared to the former Yugoslavia--because of the military defeat of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">genocidaire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government by the Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF)--it would also be misleading to suppose that a &quot;postconflict&quot; situation has obtained in Rwanda for the past several years. Unlike Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, Rwanda has not been the recipient of international peacekeepers or significant economic assistance. The instability and the debilitating struggle for daily survival remove the consideration of prosecutions and reconciliation from people's immediate concerns. And unlike the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda has suffered a continuation of armed conflict between government forces and Hutu insurgents that has involved widespread atrocities against civilians. Indeed, the multiparty armed conflict has engulfed the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and virtually the whole of central Africa, killing tens of thousands of civilians more. Hundreds of thousands may have perished from warrelated famine and disease. While the ICTY can exercise jurisdiction over all crimes committed after January 1, 1991 (when the dismemberment of the SFRY began), the ICTR exercises jurisdiction only over crimes committed in 1994, with no competence regarding events before or after that calendar year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite all these qualifications and limitations, some evidence suggests that the ICTR has contributed to discrediting and incapacitating the remnants of the former </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">genocidaire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government. In contrast to the origin of the ICTY, the initial proposal for the establishment of the ICTR came from the Rwandese government, and not the international community.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government supported such an institution, inter alia, because of its desire to avoid &quot;any suspicion of its wanting to organize speedy, vengeful justice.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The support also reflected a policy of removing any doubt as to the veracity of the genocide by internationalizing accountability. Furthermore, the government believed that &quot;it is impossible to build a state of law and arrive at true national reconciliation&quot; without eradicating the culture of impunity that had prevailed in Rwanda.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Notwithstanding the various conflicts between the ICTR and the Rwandese government as to the speed and control of proceedings and the division of labor between the Tribunal and national courts, this policy of accountability, aimed at discrediting the Hutu extremists, has also restrained the extent of anti-Hutu vengeance killings. Under the shadow of ICTR proceedings against leadership figures, the diversion of popular fury at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">genocidaires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> through the national criminal justice system, however inadequate and rudimentary, appears to have exercised a moderating influence in the postconflict peace-building process. The detention and trial of tens of thousands of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">genocidaires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before Rwandese courts may be viewed as an alternative to mass expulsions or widespread extrajudicial executions and private revenge killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICTR has made its most obvious contribution by politically incapacitating the remnants of the Hutu extremist leadership responsible for the 1994 genocide. By internationalizing the justice process under Security Council authority, countries as diverse as Belgium, Cameroon, France, Kenya, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Zambia have been called upon to apprehend the genocidal leaders indicted by the ICTR. Hutu insurgents continued to launch military attacks against the RPF government from northwestern Rwanda and the DRC at least until 1999, but the decapitation of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">genocidaire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leadership has thwarted any political rehabilitation and military reorganization of Hutu extremism. This is the result of the arrests as well as the stigmatization of those associated with the previous government. Without the ICTR, it would have been much easier for the defunct Interahamwe to find political sympathizers, and to launch a more vigorous campaign against the successor government. Of course, the defeat of the Hutu insurgency is primarily because of the RPF's military onslaught in the DRC, which forced hundreds of thousands of Rwandans to move into government-controlled &quot;villages&quot; in &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the northwest. Nonetheless, had foreign governments provided continued political and financial support for the Hutu insurgents, the Tutsi government's military victory against the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">genocidaires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would have encountered more resistance, and long-term stability in Rwanda would have become more elusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICTR's other key role in postconflict peace building is in moderating Tutsi revenge killings against Hutu. Although the fighting in the DRC has claimed many more civilian lives, international accountability has made the Tutsi government more cautious about violent anti-Hutu reprisals. In effect, the international recognition of the Tutsi's status as victims of genocide has made moral credibility a valuable political asset for the present regime and increased the costs of anti-Hutu revanchism. The interests of the Tutsi government are clearly served by distinguishing itself from the previous rulers of Rwanda and avoiding any suggestion of moral parity. This objective has been pursued through the prosecution of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">genocidaires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, to a lesser extent, through a certain measure of accountability for atrocities against the Hutu. In this latter respect, the integration of accountability as an important ingredient in the political process has increased the government's responsiveness to allegations of human rights abuses. Although the ICTR's impact can be exaggerated against a backdrop of considerable violence, the Tutsi-led government views the erosion of its privileged moral status and international legitimacy with concern. The practical impact of this attitude is seen in the occasional punishment of crimes perpetrated by government forces against Hutu civilians. &quot;An increasingly active military justice system [has] tried soldiers for indiscipline and common crimes, sentencing several to prison and even to death . . . for charges such as theft and [individual] murder,&quot; Human Rights Watch has noted.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With respect to massacres against civilians, the record is less impressive. Despite several arrests, &quot;few of the accused were brought to trial or seriously punished for human rights abuses in the course of military operations.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few exceptional cases can be found, such as a &quot;noteworthy trial&quot; in which &quot;a major was sentenced to life in prison and a subordinate to a term of forty-five months for having massacred more than thirty civilians in July 1994.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These modest measures should be considered in the context of a militant postgenocide &quot;survivalism.&quot; &quot;The lesson of the genocide,&quot; according to RPF leader Paul Kagame's spokesman Emmanuel Ndahiro, &quot;is that either we are able to organize ourselves and look after ourselves or [we] perish.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is no secret that the national trials in Rwanda have been far from ideal. The Human Rights Watch report for 2000 notes that &quot;trials of persons accused of genocide moved at a snail's pace during 1999 . . . . Prosecutors, judges, and investigators were poorly paid and subject to pressure and sometimes to threats from all sides.&quot; Out of 135,000 persons accused of genocide, &quot;fewer than 2,000 . . . had been tried since the trials began nearly three years ago.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, the report points to the politicization of the delivery of justice: persons from the top to the bottom of society were accused of genocide, anti-Tutsi activities, or links to the insurgents &quot;whenever personal or political enemies wanted to threaten them.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To this grim situation may be added &quot;inhumane conditions of overcrowding and lack of sanitary facilities&quot; in Rwandese prisons, which held some 150,000 prisoners.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonetheless, the situation could have been far worse without any resort to the criminal justice system in the aftermath of the 1994 genocide. Although the top leadership was apprehended by the ICTR, countless victims have to live next to neighbors who participated in the killings. Channeling the desire for vengeance into legal process, even with the imprisonment of thousands, bought &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*25]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  time until circumstances improved and mitigated the severity of retaliatory abuses. For example, as of October 1999, 3,500 detainees had been released, including elderly, infirm, and young prisoners, because their files were determined not to contain substantial proof of guilt. The Rwandese authorities are currently considering a form of popular justice based on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">gacaca</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a customary procedure for conflict resolution. With the gradual stabilization of Rwanda, this emerging leniency is likely to increase, allowing improvements in the criminal justice system and better prospects for national reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relationship between the ICTR and national trials manifests considerable complexity, even in achieving national reconciliation. The ICTR has often been faulted for its remoteness from the Rwandese people. Its geographical location in Arusha, Tanzania, makes it visibly distant, even though it has tried increasingly to inform the public about its activities through the Rwandese media. Professor Jose Alvarez points out that prosecutions before Rwandese courts are preferable to ICTR adjudication because &quot;local justice is more accessible, more compatible with community expectations, and . . . may present greater opportunities for control over both criminal and civil proceedings.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1999 former ICTR prosecutor Louise Arbour recognized the possibility of &quot;an enhanced visibility for the Arusha Tribunal through periodic sessions in Kigali, where certain testimony or depositions could be received by judges of the international tribunal who would move to Kigali to hear certain witnesses.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But an enhanced presence in Rwanda, and increasing Rwandese participation and control of the judicial process, must be considered against the realities of a ravaged judicial system operating with serious security problems in a volatile political situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Professor Alvarez's observation that &quot;each dollar spent . . . on the ICTR is one less dollar available for assistance to Rwandan courts,&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it takes more than money to transform a fledgling group of hastily trained magistrates and lawyers into a viable judicial system capable of complying with minimal guarantees of a fair trial. Contrary to popular perceptions, the Rwandese judiciary has received considerable funds. By March 1998, &quot;donors had provided more than U.S. $ 17 million for the administration of justice and were in the process of disbursing grants amounting to another $ 13 million,&quot; yet the Rwandese judicial system still &quot;functioned poorly.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Time, training, and experience, and a favorable political and social climate are needed before a judicial system can function impartially and effectively. The ambassador of Rwanda to the United States, Theogene Rudasingwa, has pointed out that &quot;there are just over one hundred prosecutors in the country and most of these prosecutors are high school graduates. . . . There are probably only about sixty private lawyers in the entire country.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This grave situation has obviously affected the administration of justice before Rwandese courts. According to Human Rights Watch, &quot;More than one hundred persons were condemned to death for genocide&quot; in local trials in 1997, despite concerns that &quot;some of the trials had failed to meet international standards of due process. In several, the accused had no access to counsel and presented no witnesses in their defense.&quot; In the case of Silas Mynyagishari, a former Hutu prosecutor, &quot;political considerations may have influenced the verdict. The executions were carried out in several towns before large and often festive crowds.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore, even considerable material resources do not necessarily produce an impartial justice system in a short time, and local involvement must be weighed against the ever-present danger of vengeance--especially in the visible cases of former leaders of the genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security problems and the politicization of the judiciary also impede the holding of international trials in Rwanda. Human Rights Watch reported that in 1999 the government suspended &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the president of the court of cassation, and he later resigned &quot;under pressure.&quot; The government also suspended or removed five other leading magistrates or counselors, including &quot;the highest ranking magistrates in place before 1994.&quot; Their removal left the judiciary &quot;largely in the hands of Tutsi.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In July 1999, &quot;the entire Supreme Court was replaced, after the judges were removed or pressured to resign.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In yet other cases that indicate &quot;the risks of attempting to deliver justice,&quot; the prosecutor in Gisenyi prefecture &quot;disappeared,&quot; a lawyer was &quot;murdered just after agreeing to defend persons accused of genocide,&quot; and &quot;the president of the tribunal of first instance in Kigali, a Tutsi survivor of genocide, chose exile in Canada.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Alvarez has suggested that,</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>since the post-genocide courts of Rwanda have acquitted a number of Hutu defendants, one might have thought that ICTR proceedings would take precedence only as needed, as when a country refuses to extradite to Rwanda a particular perpetrator or after a particularized finding that Rwandan courts would not grant a defendant a fair trial.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>One can only commend the impulse underlying this approach and bemoan an elitist international justice far removed from victims and survivors, and oblivious to the idiosyncratic context of Rwanda. However, in view of regular threats and violence against magistrates, prosecutors, and defenders by both Hutu and Tutsi--in relation to proceedings regarding lower ranking accused as well as the emotionally charged prosecution of high-ranking leaders--and political interference in the judicial process, the view that national trials in Rwanda lack serious problems does not correspond to reality. This is not to say that concurrent national trials are undesirable. That conditions in Rwanda do not entirely favor national trials does not mean such prosecutions should be abandoned. If anything, these efforts should be supported so as to give the judiciary over time the experience necessary for long-term self-sufficiency, and to avoid the much worse alternative of revenge killings against the countless Hutu suspects that the ICTR cannot prosecute because of its limited capacity. The ICTR is not intended to substitute for the Rwandese judicial system, but to serve as a jurisdiction with limited resources focusing on the arrest and prosecution of the most senior accused. Furthermore, far from being mutually exclusive, concurrent trials before the ICTR and national courts are mutually reinforcing. As noted by Ambassador Rudasingwa, &quot;we should get in the habit of thinking about the ICTR and the Rwandan process as complementary rather than competing. I think we have the same objectives and the same goals.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The initial distrust and tensions between the ICTR and Rwanda have been replaced by increasing cooperation and understanding. The ICTR Office of the Prosecutor has had greater contact with Rwandese magistrates in various communes and cooperated in investigations. More and more Rwandese officials--including lawyers from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court--have been attending ICTR proceedings in Arusha. The Rwandese government has appointed an official representative to the ICTR to expedite the investigative access needed for effective prosecutions. Thus, the symbiosis between international and national trials has become increasingly apparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against the backdrop of the 1994 genocide, and the killing and mass expulsion of tens of thousands in its aftermath, the ICTR has made a modest contribution to postconflict peace building. But it has palpably improved the postconflict situation by impeding the resurrection of the former government and enhancing the political attraction of criminal justice as an alternative to anti-Hutu violence. The internationalization of accountability and its gradual internalization in the African continent may be an equally significant legacy of the ICTR. According to observers, the indictment before Senegalese courts of the former head of state of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*27]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chad, Hissein Habre, though later dismissed, was one of the fruits of the ICTR's Africanization of accountability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IV. MAKING ACCOUNTABILITY FASHIONABLE: CHANGING THE RULES OF LEGITIMACY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the broader impact of the ICTY and the ICTR on transforming a culture of impunity should not be overlooked. These institutions have &quot;mainstreamed&quot; accountability in international relations and thus instilled long-term inhibitions against international crimes in the global community. The establishment of the ICTY and the ICTR helped to revive the process of adopting a statute for an international criminal court. Despite its limited jurisdictional reach, the ICC will make it increasingly difficult for states to avoid their obligations to impose individual accountability for international crimes. Pending the entry into force of the ICC statute, the relative success of the two international criminal tribunals has brought calls for ad hoc judicial intervention in response to other large-scale atrocities. The increased national prestige associated with accountability and the stigma attached to the failure to prosecute international crimes have also encouraged third-party states to use their courts to assert universal jurisdiction over accused war criminals. Several states have prosecuted Yugoslav or Rwandese perpetrators, even when no international indictments had been issued.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Pinochet</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> national case, proceedings before English and Spanish courts gave impetus to renewed proceedings before the Chilean courts, despite once insurmountable political obstacles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of the ICC on the prevention of international crimes can only be surmised since its statute has not yet entered into force. The states most likely to commit themselves to scrutiny are those least likely to violate human rights. But even states with a good human rights record may backslide during a change of regimes. Indeed, that is what happened in the former Yugoslavia, which ratified major human rights treaties before the outbreak of ethnic war in the 1990s. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Application of the Genocide Convention</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case,  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> initiated by Bosnia-Herzegovina against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia before the International Court of Justice, was made possible because of Yugoslavia's acceptance of international jurisdiction at a time when such a case could not have been envisaged. Members of the international community may also exert pressure on reluctant states to ratify the ICC statute as a rite of passage to international respectability and credibility. This tactic could be applied not only to so-called pariah states, but also to more influential states with leadership aspirations. One can safely assume, however, that selective Security Council enforcement action under Chapter VII of the Charter--whether in the form of further ad hoc tribunals like the ICTY and the ICTR or referrals to the ICC--will continue to be the mainstay of international criminal prosecutions for the foreseeable future. As Louise Arbour and Morten Bergsmo have observed, &quot;It may be a more accurate proposition that the restrictive jurisdictional regime of the ICC Statute will make effective investigation and prosecution by the Court very difficult as long as a situation has not been referred by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter . . . .&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process leading to the adoption of the ICC statute constituted an important exercise in acculturation engaging thousands of diplomats, advisers, academics, and activists who represented states, international organizations, and NGOs. This process has resulted in greater exposure to and familiarity with the basic principles and procedures of international criminal &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*28]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  law, strengthening the idea of accountability in a system of sovereign states. The negotiations leading to the adoption of the ICC statute have made an important contribution to the internalization of relevant human rights and humanitarian law norms, instilling inhibitions against international crimes and making them less acceptable in the community of nations. A significant number of the &quot;like-minded&quot; states that supported a strong and effective ICC have felt impelled to assert national-court jurisdiction over crimes of universal significance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community increasingly views impunity for large-scale atrocities as an impediment to postconflict peace building and stability. A stark example is the &quot;absolute and free pardon and reprieve&quot; granted to the insurgent RUF under the 1999 Lome Agreement in Sierra Leone, concluded by the democratically elected government under international pressure.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a ruthless campaign aimed at profiting from Sierra Leone's vast gold and diamond reserves, the RUF attempted to win the &quot;allegiance&quot; of people through the exhaustive employment of terror. RUF tactics included the abduction and forced recruitment of children and the use of narcotics to turn them into effective killers, often against their own family members. Widespread killing, rape, and torture were common, and those suspected of supporting the government--as well as their children and infants--had limbs amputated in a form of &quot;rule by terror.&quot; As part of an internationally sponsored &quot;solution&quot; to the horrific war of atrocities plaguing Sierra Leone, the RUF leader, Foday Sankoh, was appointed vice president and chairman of the Commission for Strategic Mineral Resources and Development, in a power-sharing agreement with the democratically elected government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. Thus, Sankoh was allowed to maintain control over the natural resources that had financed his war of terror against the civilian population since 1991. Predictably, Sankoh was not a reliable partner. He continued his ruthless quest for absolute power and supremacy, as if the Lome Peace Agreement had changed nothing. The atrocities continued unabated, as did the pillage of the diamonds and gold. The RUF also took hostage several hundred peacekeepers from the UN Assistance Mission in Sierra Leone. Sankoh attempted to escape from the capital city of Freetown but was eventually arrested by government forces and now faces prosecution. Thereafter, the government asked the Security Council to establish a special court for Sierra Leone &quot;in order to bring and maintain peace and security in Sierra Leone and the West African subregion.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Security Council endorsed this request on the understanding that &quot;the amnesty provisions of the [Lome] Agreement shall not apply to international crimes.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In retrospect, the Sankoh affair offers additional evidence that impunity is not an effective instrument for peace and stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mainstreaming of criminal justice in international relations has created an incentive in some instances for &quot;preemptive&quot; national proceedings, strengthening moderate political forces committed to reconciliation. For example, despite considerable resistance, President Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia has shown an unprecedented willingness to investigate the atrocities committed by military and paramilitary forces in East Timor before and after the population voted in favor of independence on August 30, 1999. The UN Commission on Human Rights established an International Commission of Inquiry on East Timor,  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which found &quot;patterns of gross violations of human rights and breaches of humanitarian law&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and recommended the establishment of an &quot;international human rights tribunal . . . . to try and sentence those accused.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response to these demands, President Wahid indicated his preference for trials &quot;to take place at home.&quot; UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan supported Wahid &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*29]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and emphasized that an international tribunal would not be established if the legal proceedings in Indonesia were &quot;fair and transparent.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 2000, an Indonesian commission of inquiry advised that Attorney General Marzuki Darusman should investigate six generals, including General Wiranto, who had served as chief of staff of the armed forces and was currently coordinating minister of policy and security in the cabinet. The Hasibuan commission found &quot;'convincing evidence' that the six men [were] jointly responsible for murders and arson in East Timor after the referendum&quot; and that &quot;Wiranto is guilty of negligence because as chief of staff he did not take timely action to curb the violence in East Timor.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Wahid subsequently dismissed General Wiranto, although the Indonesian Parliament later voted a general bill of amnesty. Observers point out that the Indonesian armed forces did not attack the findings of the commission because it had been established &quot;as a fortress to preempt a plan to set up an international tribunal on the mayhem in East Timor.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Air Vice Marshall Graito Usodo, &quot;The last thing we want is for outsiders to interfere in our internal matters.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite fears of a military coup, Wahid prevailed in a contest of strength with General Wiranto and, with the support of the military, ordered Wiranto's resignation pending completion of a formal investigation by the attorney general. In September 2000, the attorney general indicted nineteen officials for crimes in East Timor, including three lower level generals and a former provincial governor. Although Wiranto was not included among the accused, Indonesian prosecutors indicated that other suspects were not ruled out and said publicly that they were &quot;planning to take an incremental approach, using information gleaned from lower-level officials to assemble cases against the senior ones.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Calling the indictments &quot;an encouraging and very positive first step,&quot; the special representative of the UN Secretary-General in East Timor, Sergio Vieira de Mello, suggested that &quot;we shouldn't be disappointed if the glass is only half full now.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Wahid embraced accountability not just to appease the international community, but also to check the power of the military, strengthen democracy, and promote national reconciliation. Changes in the military command, including Wahid's order for the resignation of General Wiranto, were partially linked with international pressures but clearly served his democratic and reformist agenda. One commentator observed that, from the time of his election in October 1999, Wahid had &quot;set about loosening the Indonesian military's well-fortified power base, brick by cautious brick,&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> including through prosecutions for abuses. &quot;It will help him . . . that unless Indonesia proceeds with its own trials, the UN is ready to create an international criminal tribunal on East Timor.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accountability for atrocities and corruption, it was noted, &quot;is the key to obtaining the international investment and aid Indonesia desperately needs. Mr. Wahid is playing his aces--democratic legitimacy and international support--to break with the past.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wahid has been especially concerned with interethnic reconciliation and national unity. Aware that military abuses have weakened support for Jakarta's rule in outlying provinces, he has prosecuted human rights abuses to moderate the centrifugal forces tearing apart the heterogeneous archipelago, particularly in the province of Aceh in northwestern Sumatra. According &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*30]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to a member of the Indonesian Commission of Inquiry into Human Rights Violations in East Timor, &quot;The killings in Aceh are far more horrible than those that occurred in East Timor [in 1999].&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On May 17, 2000, an Indonesian court convicted twenty-four members of the armed forces and one civilian for the murder of students in the Free Aceh </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These prosecutions were linked with the first cease-fire and peace negotiations with the separatist insurgents in a twenty-five-year-old conflict that has claimed thousands of lives.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, such is the importance of accountability to reconciliation in the newly democratic Indonesia that President Wahid has even initiated a judicial inquiry into the killing of some five hundred thousand &quot;communists&quot; in the 1965-1966 coup that brought President Suharto to power.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (The political ambition of Suharto's children may also explain this measure.) Despite political limitations, Wahid's efforts suggest that international demands for criminal justice can inspire action by national courts, and that such pressures can be used to weaken the grip of militarist elements with a view to strengthening democratic forces and promoting national reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">V. ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE &quot;NEW REALISM&quot;: TOWARD &quot;PRAGMATIC IDEALISM&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current prominence of accountability, and its emergence as a significant element of international relations, is a reflection of a desire for justice, as well as utilitarian objectives of postconflict peace building and the long-term prevention of mass violence. Impunity is often a recipe for continued violence and instability. The examples of the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and other transitional situations demonstrate how hard it is becoming even for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">realpolitik</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> observers and diehard cynics to deny the preventive effects of prosecuting murderous rulers. Indeed, the rules of legitimacy in international relations have so dramatically changed since the inception of the ICTY, the ICTR, and the ICC during the 1990s that accountability is arguably a reflection of a new &quot;realism.&quot; A past view of policy based on principles of justice as naive and unrealistic has been seriously challenged by the convergence of realities and ideals in postconflict peace building and reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accountability is ultimately effective when it conforms with the broader policy context within which it operates. In contrast to the prevention of ongoing atrocities through military intervention or peacekeeping, and substantial postconflict economic assistance and social rehabilitation, resort to international tribunals incurs a rather modest financial and political cost. However, the attractive spectacle of courtroom drama, which pits darkness against the forces of light and reduces the world to a manageable narrative, could lead international criminal justice to become an exercise in moral self-affirmation and a substitute for genuine commitment and resolve. Postmortem justice without a corresponding commitment of military, political, and economic resources significantly dilutes the message of accountability and undermines its long-term viability in preventing crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International criminal justice also cannot enjoy long-term credibility if it becomes an instrument of hegemony for powerful states. Understandably, in a slightly primitive international order built on the anarchy of power and state sovereignty, the early glimmerings of international criminal justice manifest themselves in selective ad hoc accountability. It is reasonable to assume that the progressive internalization of international criminal justice will gradually spread from the periphery to the center and give rise to a more inclusive universal framework, possibly through a widely ratified ICC statute together with vigilant and invigorated national or foreign courts. If the international community is to move beyond the currently fragmented assortment of jurisdictions to a coherent system of justice, a great burden falls on the shoulders of influential states to set a fitting moral example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*31]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No one should entertain the illusion that the relative success of the ICTY, the ICTR, and the ICC process, or the engagement of national and foreign courts, has somehow exorcised the specter of genocide and other massive crimes from our midst. The reality of widespread atrocities in Africa and elsewhere leaves little room for judicial romanticism and even less for moral triumphalism. Achieving effective prevention against an entrenched culture of impunity, and fostering inhibitions against widespread rape, pillage, and murder in a context of habitual violence, cannot be realized through the efforts of a few ad hoc tribunals and national trials here and there. As Professor David Wippman has observed, international criminal prosecutions may &quot;strengthen whatever internal bulwarks help individuals obey the rules of war, but the general deterrent effect of such prosecutions seems likely to be modest and incremental, rather than dramatic and transformative.&quot;  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, in contrast with the gloom that encircled those seeking justice in the not-so-remote past, even these modest and early glimmerings of international criminal justice may be dramatic and transformative.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c30"><SPAN CLASS="c20">The effect of the criminal law and its enforcement may be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c27">mere deterrence</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c20">. Because of the hazards involved, a person who contemplates a punishable offense might not act. But it is not correct to regard general prevention and deterrence as one and the same thing. The concept of general prevention also includes the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c27">moral</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c20"> or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c27">socio-pedagogical</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c20"> influence of punishment. The &quot;messages&quot; sent by law and the legal processes contain factual information about what would be risked by disobedience, but they also contain proclamations specifying that it is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c27">wrong</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c20"> to disobey.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c20">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c27">Id.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c20"> at 950. In other words, general prevention consists of both deterrence through fear of punishment in society and the moral influence of punishment as an expression of social disapproval.</SPAN></P>

It is hard to imagine a more desperately tedious-sounding topic than whether &quot;international law&quot; is really &quot;law.&quot; ...  The Soviets have attacked, and I am invoking Article 5 of the NATO Treaty?&quot; Suppose then that the President had said: &quot;Well, I have Article 5 here, and I don't read it to say that we're bound to come to your defense. ... Efforts to minimize or override the nation-state under the weight of &quot;international law&quot; have found further expression in the expansive elaboration of the doctrine of &quot;universal jurisdiction.&quot; ...  Albright's real failure, and those who supported the intrusion of &quot;international law&quot; into the Breard case, was ignoring the legitimate, indeed overwhelming, national interest in honoring our own laws and our own Constitution. ...  It is precisely because the United States is not simply one among 189 members of the United Nations that our debate on the death penalty, as on so many other domestic policy issues, makes us the focus of so much effort to bind our policies through international constraints. ... &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> TEXT:<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is hard to imagine a more desperately tedious-sounding topic than whether &quot;international law&quot; is really &quot;law.&quot; Practicing lawyers and legal academics, let alone normal people, may become overwhelmed with boredom just reading the title of such an essay, even before plunging into the text. Beneath the comatose appearances, however, a political battle of immense significance is underway. Indeed, close observers believe the struggle may already be almost over, with enormous adverse consequences to the international interests and constitutional system of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a rich tradition of skepticism about the &quot;legality&quot; of international law,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> although much of the intellectual debate consists of two streams of argument that never really engage in actual combat. Critically, skepticism about international law does not depend at all on whether one's foreign-policy views are internationalist, isolationist or lie at any point in between, but rather on properly understanding why nations behave as they do among themselves and whether concepts of law used domestically can be exported &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  wholesale into international affairs. This is an important conceptual point to make at the outset, if for no other reason than to avoid the rhetorical onslaught of the &quot;international law&quot; advocates who immediately label any skeptic as an &quot;isolationist,&quot; with overwhelmingly negative implications. In fact, of course, one can be a vigorous internationalist, and simultaneously thoroughly unimpressed by the tenuous claims of &quot;international law.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. IS IT &quot;LAW&quot; OR ISN'T IT?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with any body of literature that is purportedly &quot;law,&quot; the central philosophical question about &quot;international law&quot; is a liberty issue: How does this corpus of &quot;law&quot; affect individuals in the exercise of their individual freedom? For many years, during virtually the entire history of international law until World War II, even its most vociferous advocates rarely argued anything other than that international law governed conduct among nation-states. Individuals and associations were rarely affected directly, and even the impact of international law on nation-states and their respective citizens was at most highly limited. Today, however, the central debates in the field are precisely about international law's command over individuals and groups within states. Although now largely targeted against war criminals and other alleged reprobates, the logic of today's international law proponents drives them toward more pervasive international command-and-control structures that will deeply affect the domestic policies and constitutions of all nations. Thus, the liberty question has never before been posed so dramatically, nor have the implications of the possible answers to this question been quite so clear as now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To start, let us define in summary fashion what, at least in the United States, &quot;law&quot; is commonly understood to be. We understand &quot;law&quot; to be a system of commands, obligations and rules that regulate relations among individuals and associations, and the sources of legitimate coercive authority in society. These are the forces that can compel behavior and enforce compliance with rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For any system of law, there are two basic prerequisites for legitimacy (and hence compliance). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">First</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it has to exist within a coherent structural framework--a constitution--that defines the government's authority, and by so doing, limits it, thus preventing arbitrary authority. The great scholar, Professor McIlwain, once said, &quot;All constitutional government is by definition limited government.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is critically important for a free person's understanding of law that there is an over-arching structure within which the subsidiary aspects of the law develop. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Second</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the source of coercive &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  authority--the &quot;rule of law&quot;--rests on popular sovereignty or public accountability through reasonably democratic popular controls over the creation, interpretation, and enforcement of laws, the three broad ways in which law develops. Any other definition of law is either incoherent or unacceptable to a free person. Of course, much of the world's law does not rest on popular sovereignty, even in many Western European countries commonly accepted as &quot;democracies.&quot; In Chinese, for example, there is no distinction between the phrase &quot;rule of law&quot; and &quot;rule by law,&quot; a distinction we see as fundamental for liberty purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These admittedly somewhat abstract definitions and principles have very important practical implications. The first is that the sources of law are identifiable and authoritative. The second is that the mechanism for interpreting and resolving conflicts and disputes among parties under law is agreed upon. The third is that the source of law enforcement (including execution and compliance activities), as well as the methods and procedures for declaring and changing the law, is also agreed upon. This is true both in public and private law, in civil as well as criminal, and in law enforcement as well as the typical civil disputes that occupy much of our courts' time. These practical implications are all embodied in the United States Constitution and its system of government, exemplifying the kind of legal system acceptable to a free person. One need not argue that a proper structure of government </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">must</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> be like that of the United States, with three separate branches, but the Constitution is conceptually quite clear in defining the heads of authority for law creation, interpretation, and enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other problems with &quot;international law,&quot; there are simply no agreed-upon sources.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recognizing this gaping hole, its advocates have written reams of attempted explanations, but even their best guesses are failures.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, one way in which &quot;international law&quot; is said to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  develop is through treaties, the written, agreed-upon documents that nations sign and pledge to follow. Treaties are often analogized to contracts, agreements between people, businesses, or other kinds of associations. This analogy is fundamentally wrong.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the simplest and best definitions of &quot;contract&quot; is from Restatement (Second) Contracts, stating: &quot;A contract is a promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy. . . .&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This definition has two parts. The first part is &quot;a promise,&quot; and the second is &quot;for the breach of which the law gives a remedy.&quot; By &quot;remedy&quot; we mean that when one contracting party breaches his or her obligation, there is a judicial mechanism to either obtain damages for the breach of the promise or to get specific performance of that to which the parties had agreed. The Restatement's brief definition fully embodies the practical implications of real law described above. It is not just an abstract exchange whereby &quot;I promise X and you promise Y.&quot; The promises take place within a system, where if one party breaches its promise, there is a defined way to get remedies. There is a process to decide which promises are legitimate and a procedure to enforce a court order that a party has breached a promise. The very concept of a contract, in other words, takes place within a coherent universe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compare this to a treaty. A treaty is an exchange of promises--period. It is a flat misunderstanding of reality to believe that there are enforcement mechanisms &quot;out there&quot; internationally that conform to the kind of legal system that exists in the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court long ago understood this critical difference, even if the dreamier supporters of international law could not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A treaty is primarily a compact between independent nations. It depends for the enforcement of its provisions on the interest and the honor of the governments which are parties to it. If these fail, its infraction becomes the subject of international negotiations and reclamations, so far as the injured party chooses to seek redress, which may in the end be enforced by actual war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not domestic law at work. Accordingly, there is no reason to consider treaties as &quot;legally&quot; binding internationally, and certainly not as &quot;law&quot; themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is at this point that advocates of international law usually deploy the &quot;isolationist&quot; broadsword, arguing that this view means the end of all treaties, international chaos, and a retreat into the &quot;American cave.&quot; These are all overreactions. Simply because treaties are not &quot;law&quot; does not mean that states are not in some sense bound by them, or that states may dismiss or ignore treaty promises without consequence. Nor does it mean that failing to consider treaties as law unleashes anarchy upon the world. Consider three sentences about treaties:</SPAN></P>

</TABLE>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, two points that more fully explain the import of &quot;de-legalizing&quot; treaties that is manifested in the differences among these three sentences. First, these three sentences say three different things. Being morally bound is not the same as being politically bound, and being politically bound is not the same as being legally bound. Second, Sentences One and Two are true, while Sentence Three is false. There is no legal mechanism--no coherent structure--that exists today on a global level to enforce compliance with treaties, a fact international law advocates flatly ignore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is emphatically </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to say that the United States should freely ignore its treaty obligations. Indeed, moral and political obligations in the real international world are often far more binding than &quot;law.&quot; Take, for example, Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, the bedrock of foreign policy in the United States for fifty years, which provides explicitly &quot;that an armed attack upon one or more [member] in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Are we legally bound by Article 5? What if, during the Cold War, the signatories to the Warsaw Pact had attacked Germany, and the Chancellor had called the President of the United States and said: &quot;We've got a problem here. The Soviets have attacked, and I am invoking Article 5 of the NATO Treaty?&quot; Suppose then that the President had said: &quot;Well, I have Article 5 here, and I don't read it to say that we're bound to come to your defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would the Chancellor then have gone to court to obtain an injunction to force the United States to abide by Article 5? Of course not. Our word in that case is our political word and our moral word. It has nothing to do with legality. That is why, properly understood, the distinction between &quot;legal&quot; and other commitments implies not anarchy, but rather a truer, more realistic understanding of treaty obligations. Indeed, the precise &quot;legal&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  obligation contained in Article 5 is surprisingly weak, providing only that each NATO member &quot;will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">such action as it deems necessary</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including the use of force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second source of &quot;international law&quot; is the ways in which nations behave, the practices they engage in over the years, a source that evolves and becomes international law. This &quot;state practice&quot; is the basis of what is called &quot;customary international law,&quot; which is said to be just as binding on nations  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as, for example, laws that have passed through the constitutional system of the United States. But this is plainly wrong. Practice is practice, and custom is custom; neither one is law. Customary international law changes under this definition when state practice changes, which led former Attorney General Bill Barr to opine: &quot;Well, as I understand it, what you're saying is the only way to change international law is to break it.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This telling remark shows the incoherence of treating &quot;customary international law&quot; as law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, customary international law is always &quot;out there&quot; developing. In the debate over the International Criminal Court,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japanese Ambassador Owada said, &quot;We ought to leave open the possibility of expanding the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court as new criminal offenses crystallize in the international system.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Imagine citizens of the United States learning that their laws &quot;crystallized&quot; in Washington, rather than being enacted by both Houses of Congress. We would say unhesitatingly that we will not be governed by laws that &quot;crystallize,&quot; but only by laws adopted through a defined constitutional process. Thus, with respect to treaties, one can at least argue that generally a president has to sign them, and the Senate has to give its advice and consent, so there is some semblance of formal consideration and decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This point is particularly important because of the campaign to incorporate customary international law into our federal law by judicial decision, an entirely separate battlefront where there is even less democratic involvement. The locus of this dispute recently has been the Alien Tort Statute, an obscure provision of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which provides that Federal District Courts have jurisdiction over certain suits by aliens for &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  torts &quot;committed in violation of the law of nations. . . .&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 1980 Federal appellate court decision essentially held that this statute opened U.S. courts to adjudicate claims based on &quot;customary international law.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A contrary opinion by Judge Robert H. Bork, writing in a divided panel of the District of Columbia Circuit,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rejected that argument, holding that the Act may give the court jurisdiction, but it does not create a cause of action--that is, a substantive basis for judicial relief. The role of &quot;customary international law,&quot; in areas well beyond the Alien Tort Statute, is now under intense debate in academic circles, and it has enormous implications.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is not simply a philosophical debate between &quot;monism&quot; and &quot;dualism,&quot; but an intensely practical political struggle. If international law can, in effect, be incorporated into U.S. law by judicial decision, it is far easier and far less democratic than struggling to get Congress to adopt it by statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is another important source of international law, which the academics refer to quite regularly: the writings of academics! This notion is pervasive in international law circles, especially among the academics who stand most to benefit from its uncritical acceptance, and reflects one of its most basic undemocratic aspects. There is no better response than William F. Buckley, Jr.'s famous statement that he would rather be governed by the first two thousand names in the Boston telephone directory than by the faculty of Harvard University.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the absence of legitimately authoritative sources of international law, there is no process to bind it to the political consent of the world's population. There are no international democratic institutions that provide legitimacy for any aspect of international law. There are also no definitive dispute resolution mechanisms, and there are certainly no agreed-upon enforcement, execution or compliance mechanisms. These are not just technical, mechanistic deficiencies that can be fixed by creating new institutions. Rather, these are conceptual and institutional flaws that show fundamentally why international law is not law. They highlight graphically the point that the analysis of international law is basically a liberty question. No free person should subject himself to an untried system of authority based so much on assumptions and so little on reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Advocates of &quot;international law&quot; acknowledge that these arguments are, indeed, accurate with respect to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">domestic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> law, but they say: &quot;We are talking about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">international</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> law, so, of course, none of that applies.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is their central mistake: the conceptual underpinnings for legitimate law, in both form and substance, must apply whether we deal with municipal, state, federal or international law. If they are absent, that law lacks legitimacy and, therefore, the binding force that is central to any acceptable definition of real law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. WHY DOES IT MATTER?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why does any of this matter? In the United States, until now, &quot;international law&quot; has hardly touched us. We have not thought it terribly important. Before World War II, the &quot;law of nations&quot; dealt with fishing rights, rights of passage through international waters, the return of prisoners of war, and very little else. Since World War II, however, &quot;international law&quot; has grown enormously, and it is accumulating force that will even more dramatically impede us in the future. In the rest of the world, international law and its &quot;binding&quot; obligations are taken for granted. Even here, many believe that international problems can be solved through legal devices, that nations can, for example, sign a treaty that renounces aggressive war.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once we have signed such a treaty, then that law is binding on us, is it not? We will abjure aggression, and, of course, the other signatories will do so as well. And if they do not, why that's just illegal! Unfortunately, this enthusiasm has never troubled even slightly those inclined to use force, but it does impair our ability to understand real events in the real world.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There are four key issues for the United States: (a) the rhetorical--and, accordingly, the political--value of the word &quot;law&quot;; (b) the unique international status of the United States, and the efforts to limit and undercut that status through purportedly &quot;legal&quot; mechanisms; (c) the implications of domesticizing &quot;international law&quot; for limiting and constraining the exercise of Constitutional structures and reducing the ability of the United States' institutions of representative government to make decisions independently from &quot;international law&quot;; and (d) restraining the United States from using its military power through a variety of mechanisms. We consider each in turn, showing by specific example how claims that &quot;international law&quot; has binding and authoritative force ultimately ring either hollow or unacceptable to a free people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c13">A. The Rhetorical Value of the Word &quot;Law&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In large measure, this debate about &quot;international law&quot; is about the ethical and political persuasiveness of the world &quot;law,&quot; and when it may legitimately be invoked to order our conduct. U.S. citizens generally are a very law-abiding people. When somebody says, &quot;That's the law,&quot; our inclination is to abide by that law. Thus, if &quot;international law&quot; is justifiably deemed &quot;law,&quot; Americans will act accordingly. On the other hand, if it is not law, it is important to understand that our flexibility and our policy options are not as limited as some would have us believe. It follows inexorably, therefore, that the rhetorical persuasiveness of the word &quot;law&quot; is critically important. The advocates of international law have long recognized this phenomenon, while the skeptics have too long ignored or under-appreciated the underlying political stakes at issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, when people assert that we are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">required</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to pay assessments to the United Nations, they invariably say that the United States has a &quot;solemn legal obligation.&quot; When spoken, it is universally in a low, deeply earnest voice, and, in fact, &quot;legal obligation&quot; sounds much better than &quot;political deal,&quot; which is basically what the UN Charter represents.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arguing that something is a matter of &quot;international law&quot; has more sit-up-and-take-notice force. Claims made by decision makers both in the executive branch and in Congress in the name of &quot;international law&quot; are more intimidating than claims of &quot;international custom&quot; or &quot;state practice.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only is the &quot;solemn legal obligation&quot; theory contrary to simple common sense, it has been repeatedly rejected by the United States Supreme &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court, and not merely for the lack of enforcement mechanisms.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the American system, treaties have no special or higher status than other acts of Congress, or, for that matter, than the Constitution. For purposes of the law of the United States, treaties do not exist apart from or outside of that body of law, or in a position superior to or superseding the Constitution, or any of its requirements or prohibitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is widespread confusion on this point, among even knowledgeable and sophisticated foreign policy analysts. The confusion appears to stem largely from a misreading both of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, and of the well-known opinion by Justice Holmes in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Missouri</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Holland</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Supremacy Clause provides:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inclusion of &quot;treaties&quot; in the Clause was a deliberate effort by the Framers to subordinate contrary State laws to treaties entered into by the national government. Under the Articles of Confederation, States had frequently enacted laws that, for example, clashed with the Treaty of Paris of 1783. Just as the Framers intended duly laws at the national level to supersede contrary State laws, so too, were national treaties intended to trump State law under the Supremacy Clause.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution entrusted the treaty-making power solely to the national government, by providing that the President &quot;shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur. . . .&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, the Framers also provided that &quot;no State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation&quot; to make it completely clear that the treaty power belonged only to the national government.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Missouri</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Holland</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the State of Missouri challenged the constitutionality of the Migratory Bird Convention of 1916 with Great Britain, as well as the statute and regulations intended to implement the treaty. Missouri argued that the Convention, which attempted to limit the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  killing and capturing of migratory birds in the United States and Canada, violated the Tenth Amendment. The Supreme Court rejected Missouri's argument, and upheld the validity of the treaty, as well as the implementing statute and regulations. Justice Holmes specifically concluded that &quot;the treaty in question does not contravene any prohibitory words to be found in the Constitution.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonetheless, his opinion added expansively:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is said that a treaty cannot be valid if it infringes the Constitution, that there are limits, therefore, to the treaty-making power;, and that one such limit is that what an act of Congress could not do unaided, in derogation of the powers reserved to the States, a treaty cannot do. . . . Acts of Congress are the supreme law of the land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while treaties are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. . . . We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power, but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national wellbeing that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, &quot;a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government&quot; is not to be found.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having dealt with the Convention itself, Justice Holmes summarily upheld the implementing statute: &quot;If the treaty is valid, there can be no dispute about the validity of the statute under Article I, [Section] 8, as a necessary and proper means to execute the powers of the Government.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apprehension about the implications of Justice Holmes' dicta grew particularly acute after World War II with the formation of the United Nations and numerous other international organizations, as some became concerned that the Treaty power might be used as a &quot;back door&quot; to amend the Constitution. This anxiety in turn led to an extended discussion about whether to amend the Constitution to provide that treaties could become effective U.S. law only through subsequently enacted legislation that itself must pass constitutional muster. This debate over the &quot;Bricker Amendment,&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while inconclusive, highlighted the relationship of treaties to the United States' legal system. Perhaps sensing the need to quiet the trepidation generated by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Missouri</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Holland</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Supreme Court revisited &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the issue in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Reid</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Covert</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There, the Court invalidated the murder convictions of wives of United States' servicemen who had accompanied them as dependents overseas, and who were convicted of murdering them by military courts martial. A plurality of the Court concluded that, in general, military trials of civilians violated the Constitution, while Justices Frankfurter and Harlan limited their opinions only to capital cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plurality opinion by Justice Black rejected an argument by the government that courts martial of dependents accompanying the United States' military overseas were required to implement international agreements made with the countries where they were stationed. The Court concluded that &quot;no agreement with a foreign nation can confer power on the Congress, or on any other branch of Government, which is free from the restraints of the Constitution.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After quoting the Supremacy Clause, Justice Black wrote:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is nothing in this language which intimates that treaties and laws enacted pursuant to them do not have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution. . . . It would be manifestly contrary to the objectives of those who created the Constitution, as well as those who were responsible for the Bill of Rights--let alone alien to our entire constitutional history and tradition--to construe Article VI as permitting the United States to exercise power under an international agreement without observing constitutional prohibitions. In effect, such construction would permit amendment of that document in a manner not sanctioned by Article V.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Black said unambiguously that &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">this Court has regularly and uniformly recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He then concluded: &quot;There is nothing in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Missouri v. Holland</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that is contrary to the position taken here. There the Court carefully noted that the treaty involved was not inconsistent with any specific provision of the Constitution.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, whatever the legal impact of a treaty, that impact must be determined consistently with the Constitution and subordinate law of the United States. Here again, there is considerable confusion about the effect of U.S. treaty obligations and what it means to say that they constitute &quot;the supreme Law of the Land.&quot; In the context, for example, of UN assessments, the conventional argument is that these assessments are the result of a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  treaty obligation, hence are the &quot;Law of the Land&quot; and are legally binding on Congress to pay in a full and timely fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This line of argument is flatly incorrect. To the extent that adherence to the UN Charter carries any obligation, it is political in nature, and subject to all of the possibilities for modification or abrogation of any political arrangement. That renders it fundamentally different from a treaty that purports to affect the domestic relationship between the government and its citizens, or among private citizens, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Edye</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Robertson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (the &quot;Head Money Cases&quot;),  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Court upheld as constitutional a per-person fee on immigrants to be used for the support of those who needed care or assistance after landing. The ship owners challenging the fee's validity argued that the statute establishing the fee violated several U.S. treaty obligations. The Court rejected this argument, and in so doing articulated the important distinction between the effects of treaties in the international arena, on the one hand, and within the United States, on the other. As noted above, in the international sphere, treaties that failed resulted in &quot;negotiations and reclamations&quot; between governments, perhaps &quot;in the end . . . enforced by actual war.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to a treaty's domestic impact, however, the Court explained that:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[A] treaty may also contain provisions which confer certain rights upon the citizens or subjects of one of the Nations residing in the territorial limits of the other, which partake of the nature of municipal law, and which are capable of enforcement as between private parties in the courts of the country.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In such circumstances:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Precisely this kind of political environment is where the dispute over UN assessments is to be found, not in cognizable legal obligations. The Supreme Court has recognized:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that circumstances may arise which would not only justify the government in disregarding [a treaty's] stipulations, but demand in the interests of the country that it should do so, there can be no question. Unexpected events may call for a change in the policy of the country. Neglect or violation of stipulations on the part of the other contracting party may require corresponding action on our part. When a reciprocal engagement is not carried out by one of the contracting parties, the other may also decline to keep the corresponding engagement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN></P>

There may be good and sufficient reasons to abide by the provisions of a treaty, and in most cases one would expect to do so because of the mutuality of benefits that treaties provide, but not because the United States is &quot;legally&quot; obligated to do so. As the Supreme Court observed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Chae Chan Ping v.

<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is now engaged in the third serious debate this century about our place among the nations. The first debate centered on the League of Nations after World War I, the next on the United Nations after World War II, and, fittingly, this third debate takes place after our victory in the Cold War. The current centerpiece is whether the nation-state will survive for long in anything like its present form.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the most part, those advocating limiting its role are fundamentally antipathetic toward the nation-state in general,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and antipathetic toward one nation-state in particular--the United States.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although relatively new in the United States in its current incarnation, this debate is already well along in many other countries, virtually all of which seem relaxed about having &quot;law&quot; made for them by others. Not so in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union (&quot;EU&quot;), for example, is currently striving for &quot;ever closer union,&quot; evidenced by the recent adoption of a common currency through the European Monetary Union.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another important example of integration is trade policy, where it is no understatement to say that the EU's fifteen members have ceased to exist as nation-states for those purposes. They no longer make independent policy on trade matters as nation-states. Symbolic of that change is that when the G-7 now meets on trade matters, they meet as four: the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union. Germany, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom do not separately participate in G-7 trade meetings because they no longer have national authority outside of EU deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This disappearing act is not true on all matters, particularly foreign and security policy,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but one should not underestimate the seriousness of the Europeans surrendering their sovereignty to the EU. While there are many reasons for this development, the theoreticians of the Europeanist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  largely believe that the institution of the nation-state is historically responsible for instability in Europe, and for three wars in less than 100 years between France and Germany.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are, therefore, determined to work toward eliminating the concept of the nation-state on that continent, and while busy with that task, they and their allies are trying to obliterate it in the rest of the world as well.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is considerable popular agreement in Europe with the argument that European Union is necessary to avoid fighting another war on the continent. This is now virtually an article of faith, for which the United States bears considerable responsibility through our Cold War policies in Europe. Starting with the Marshall Plan, the United States encouraged European economic integration as well as membership in NATO,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> perhaps never foreseeing the consequence that integration would proceed as far as it has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, there is substantial evidence that most people in Europe have also not fully considered the actual implications of the continual erosion of their national sovereignties. When votes actually occur, there is a broad gap between elite opinion, which supports the erosion, and popular opinion. That is why Denmark initially rejected the Maastricht Treaty in a 1992 referendum;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> why France accepted Maastricht in a referendum by only the narrowest of margins;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> why Norway again voted against joining the EU in a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1994 referendum;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and why in the United Kingdom, despite strong Labour Party support for joining the EMU, and an overwhelming Labour House of Commons majority, Prime Minister Tony Blair is still afraid to say so explicitly.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> European elites do their best to obscure the gap between elite and popular opinion, and it is relatively easy for them to do so because, bluntly stated, European political institutions are not as democratic as those of the United States.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n61</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The European elite are the ones who wanted the EMU, as much for political as for economic reasons. This is why the stakes in the EMU are so high: if the common currency fails, political elites all over Europe will be on the defensive. If it succeeds, the EU will be a far more unified &quot;economic space&quot;--one larger than the United States. Not only will they have to accept the consequences whatever the outcome, but so will the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts to minimize or override the nation-state under the weight of &quot;international law&quot; have found further expression in the expansive elaboration of the doctrine of &quot;universal jurisdiction.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until recently an obscure, theoretical creature in the academic domain, the doctrine gained enormous public exposure (although very little scrutiny) during the efforts of an opportunistic Spanish magistrate to seize and extradite General Augusto Pinochet of Chile from the United Kingdom during a medical visit there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even defining &quot;universal jurisdiction&quot; is not easy because the idea is evolving so rapidly. For example, the sixth edition of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Black's Law Dictionary</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, published in 1990, does not even contain an entry for the term.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The idea was first associated with pirates, who were said to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">hostes humani generis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (&quot;enemies of the human race&quot;). The 1990 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Black's Law Dictionary</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presents &quot;pirates&quot; as an example of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">hostes humani generis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, suggesting that they alone would be covered by &quot;universal jurisdiction.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because pirates were beyond the control of any state and thus not subject to any existing criminal justice system, the idea developed that it was legitimate for any aggrieved party to deal with them. Such &quot;jurisdiction&quot; could be said to be &quot;universal&quot; because the crime of piracy was of concern to everyone, and because such jurisdiction did not comport with more traditional jurisdictional bases, such as &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  territoriality or nationality. In a sense, the state that prosecuted pirates could be seen as vindicating the common interest of all states.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key element in the criminal characterization of piracy is that, by definition, pirates operate on the high seas beyond state boundaries. As the Italian Alberico Gentili wrote in the late 16th century, the sea &quot;is by nature open to all men and its use is common to all, like that of the air.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Referring to ancient history, Gentili argued:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romans justly took up arms against [pirates] even though those peoples had touched nothing belonging to the Romans, to their allies, or to any one connected with them; for they had violated the common law of nations. . . . Piracy is contrary to the law of nations and the league of human society. Therefore war should be made against pirates by all men.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, this is not &quot;jurisdiction&quot; in a legal process sense, but instead a justification for the legitimate use of force. It is a far cry from what &quot;human rights&quot; activists, NGOs, and academics, who repeatedly confuse the roles of force and law, have in mind today. From a very narrow foundation, theorists have enlarged the concept of universal jurisdiction to cover far more activities, with far less historical or legal support, than arose earlier in the context of piracy. At the same time, they have omitted reference to the use of force and substituted their preferred criminal prosecution. The proscribed roster of offenses now typically includes genocide, torture, war crimes and crimes against humanity, which are said to vest prosecutorial jurisdiction in all states.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing his decision in the November 25, 1998, decision of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Ex parte Pinochet</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Lord Nicholls described the crimes of which the General stood accused: &quot;International law has made it plain that certain types of conduct . . . are not acceptable conduct on the part of anyone.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although that decision (overturned and set for rehearing because of lapses in judicial ethics by one of the majority judges,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but subsequently readopted in &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  substance)  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not actually rest on universal jurisdiction, Lord Nicholls was, in fact, stating the doctrine's essential foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worst problem with universal jurisdiction is not its diaphanous legal footings but its fundamental inappropriateness in the realm of foreign policy. In effect (and in intention), the NGOs and theoreticians advocating the concept are misapplying legal forms in political or military contexts. What constitutes &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; and whether they should be prosecuted or otherwise handled--and by whom--are not questions to be left to lawyers and judges. To deal with them as such is, ironically, so bloodless as to divorce these crimes from reality. It is not merely naive, but potentially dangerous, as Pinochet's case demonstrates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morally and politically, what Pinochet's regime did or did not do is primarily a question for Chile to resolve.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most assuredly, Pinochet is not, unlike a pirate or a slave trader, beyond the control of any state. Although many people around the world intensely dislike the solution that Chile adopted in order to restore constitutional and democratic rule in 1990--especially the various provisions for amnesty--the terms and implementation of that deal should be left to the Chileans themselves. They (and their democratically elected government) may continue to honor the deal, or they may choose to bring their own judicial proceedings against Pinochet. One may accept or reject the wisdom or morality of either course (and I would argue that they should uphold the deal), but it should be indisputable that the decision is principally theirs to make.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The idea that Spain or any other country that subsequently filed extradition requests in the United Kingdom has an interest superior to that of Chile--and can thus effectively overturn the Chilean deal--is untenable. And yet, if the British had ultimately extradited Pinochet to Spain or elsewhere, that is exactly what would have happened. A Spanish magistrate operating completely outside the Chilean system will effectively have imposed his will on the Chilean people. One is sorely tempted to ask: &quot;Who elected him?&quot; If that is what &quot;universal jurisdiction&quot; means in practice (as opposed to the theoretical world of law reviews), it is hopelessly flawed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spain </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">does</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have a legitimate interest in justice on behalf of Spanish citizens who may have been held hostage, tortured, or murdered by the Pinochet regime. And the Spanish government may take whatever steps it ultimately considers to be in the best interest of Spanish citizens, but its recourse lies with the government of Chile, and certainly not with that of the United Kingdom. If the government of Spain--as opposed to a loose cannon &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  magistrate--were truly serious, it would have approached the government of Chile directly. Whether Spain proceeded through judicial action or diplomatic channels (or both, or through military means) would, of course, have been up to Spain; in turn, Chile could have responded as it chose. But in this proper bilateral context, the Pinochet question would have been primarily a political matter. In actuality, the attempt to extradite Pinochet while he was in London was thus not the exercise of law; it was political theater.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much the same could be said about the debate over whether allegations of war crimes by members of Indonesia's armed forces in East Timor should be tried by Indonesia, or in a special tribunal to be created by the United Nations. This, too, is a question that is not simply a matter of legal process, but one that reaches the heart both of democratic theory and practice, and of national sovereignty. A UN panel of experts, formed to investigate the violence in East Timor, recommended to the Secretary General that the Security Council establish an international court along the lines of those established for Yugoslavia and Rwanda.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By contrast, a human rights commission appointed by the Indonesian government recommended to the country's Attorney General that top military leaders be tried in Indonesian courts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no dispute that atrocities took place (although the specifics remain subject to further investigation), and there is no dispute that someone should be held accountable. But the remaining questions--who should do the accounting, and how--pose a critical philosophical debate for which Indonesia's answer could set an important precedent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in Chile, the key issue in Indonesia is whether nations, especially emerging democracies, are to be afforded the chance to confront the realities of their own histories. They should set the moral, political and legal standards by which they wish to be judged, implement those standards in viable judicial codes and institutions, and then live with the consequences of those decisions. This is one critical way in which fledgling democracies mature. To take critical decisions, such as those facing Indonesia, out of their hands is to deny them the chance for historical responsibility. To be sure, the decisions they make may not be those that self-assured, higher moralists might make, but that is inherent in the concept of popular sovereignty and autonomy. Facing up to the past, reckoning how to deal with the consequences autonomously, and then consciously taking responsibility for their decisions are central to moral choice. Anyone is free to offer Indonesia advice, but it is precisely the democratic responsibility to make its own decisions that would be at risk if the decisions were internationalized. To &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  abort Indonesia's assumption of responsibility for its citizens' actions is not just elitist and paternalistic, but fundamentally violates the assumptions of democratic government. Unlike unfortunate Chile, Indonesia should be given the breathing space it needs to confront what happened in East Timor, and neither spared the pain of so doing nor the lesson of living with whatever it decides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the predominant view in the United States has been that this is precisely the kind of dispute best left to the political branches. Chief Justice Melville Fuller said clearly in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Underhill</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Hernandez</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Redress of grievances by reason of such acts must be obtained through the means open to be availed of by sovereign powers as between themselves.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Robert H. Bork, concurring in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Tel-Oren</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Libyan Arab Republic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, warned against a role for courts that &quot;would raise substantial problems of judicial interference with nonjudicial functions, such as the conduct of foreign relations.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stressing the purely legal aspects of a dispute--central to the entire contemporary concept of universal jurisdiction--not only ignores the political component, but foists responsibility onto the least-equipped branch of government. Widespread use of the doctrine would almost surely exacerbate political tensions between countries without adequately addressing the underlying causes of their original disagreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the substantial publicity surrounding the Pinochet matter, we can expect copycat efforts covering a range of other &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; in the near future.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But adding purported crimes (shocking though they may be) to the list of what triggers universal jurisdiction does not make the concept any more real. Nor does a flurry of law review articles (and there has been far more than a flurry) make concrete an abstract speculation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, &quot;universal jurisdiction&quot; is conceptually circular: universal jurisdiction covers the most dastardly offenses; accordingly, if the offense is dastardly, there must be universal jurisdiction to prosecute it. Precisely because of this circularity, there is absolutely no limit to what &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  creative imaginations can enlarge it to cover, and we can be sure that they are already hard at work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any concept that can expand so dramatically so quickly--from piracy to genocide--is unlikely to slow down soon. Although one area of expansion will almost certainly be the official conduct of foreign policy, the realm of business and commercial activity will not be overlooked.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Typically, the existing &quot;universal jurisdiction&quot; crimes require an element of illicit governmental action, but not all do. For the creative activist, glossing over a &quot;state action&quot; requirement should prove no hurdle at all in proscribing what, in Lord Nicholls words, is &quot;not acceptable conduct on the part of anyone.&quot; Consider just three examples: (i) major environmental disasters, particularly those with international implications like an oil spill at sea, could easily be envisaged as &quot;crimes against humanity,&quot; and therefore subject to prosecution universally. An analogy to maritime piracy would be strained, to say the least, but not beyond either the ability or inclination of NGOs and academic theorists; (ii) unsatisfactory wages, hours or other conditions of employment at multinational corporations are already targets of union and human rights activists, who would not need much encouragement to liken such practices to slavery; and (iii) mining or manufacturing near sites of cultural or historical interest--what UNESCO devotees like to call the &quot;common heritage of mankind&quot;--could quite readily become the subject of universal jurisdiction, especially since the states where such activities occur might be classified as too weak to vindicate their own interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, an oil company whose tanker broke up on the high seas could be brought to trial in an environmentally conscious Nordic state. A law-wage transnational could be prosecuted by a righteous Social Democratic government in Europe. A &quot;culturally insensitive&quot; company could be indicted almost anywhere cultural sensitivity is an issue. In each case, senior corporate executives could be arrested, detained and ultimately extradited for trial in countries far removed from any traditional nexus to the alleged offenses. Surely, no one will object, for they are, after all, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">hostes humani generis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, are they not? We are not yet at this point, but the warning signs are clear. Consigning &quot;universal jurisdiction&quot; to the isolated debates of legal academics is seriously ill-advised from both foreign and economic policy perspectives, and more dispassionate analysis of the concept is sorely needed. Here is a clear case where law is too important to be left to law professors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, there are undoubtedly issues, such as those involving terrorism, that are not really suitable for a &quot;legal&quot; resolution. One such example may be the case of Pan Am 103, blown out of the sky over Lockerbie, Scotland, on December 21, 1988.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nine years after the UN Security Council &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  condemned Libya for its involvement in the conspiracy to destroy Pan Am 103, and subsequently imposed limited economic sanctions, Libya agreed to turn over two of its intelligence agents who had been indicted for murder by prosecutors in the United States and Scotland.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the beginning of their trial on May 3, 2000, before a special Scottish court, sitting in the Netherlands (at Libya's insistence)  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might seem like something to celebrate, a time for rhetoric about &quot;the international rule of law,&quot; the trial actually marks the final collapse of United States policy against Libyan terrorism, and the end of its efforts for a real vindication of Pan Am 103's victims. This collapse embodies both a failure of will to use military force to respond to a brutal attack on United States citizens, and self-imposed, potentially crippling limitations on even the narrow avenue of prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basic wrong turn in policy began with the Bush Administration's decision in 1991-92 to judicialize the Pan Am 103 matter rather than to use force, in effect treating this Libyan act of terror like a domestic murder case, rather than the political-military attack that it was. In January 1992, the Security Council took the unprecedented step of deploring Libya's failure to cooperate with international law-enforcement efforts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two months later, in another unprecedented step, the Council's Resolution 748 imposed economic sanctions against Libya.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although hailed at the time as great victories, in fact, there was little enthusiasm for the initial Council condemnation of Libya, and there was barely enough support for the subsequent imposition of sanctions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 1992, the United States has faced continuous pressure to scale back or eliminate the sanctions on any pretext, largely from Europeans who would rather trade with Moammar Gadhafi than punish him for murder.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, not even Gadhafi played along with this charade. In an April 3, 2000 speech to the African-European summit in Cairo, just before the opening of the trial, he declared that &quot;Africa is not a ping-pong ball to be hit &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  once by Europe, once by the U.S.,&quot; and &quot;we do not need democracy; we need water pumps.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even assuming that military retaliation was out of the question, either because of the passage of time between the destruction of Pan Am 103 and the point at which the United States and Great Britain's investigators could reasonably conclude that Libya was responsible, or because of a conscious policy decision not to use force, several critical mistakes were made. Ironically, these mistakes weaken national legal institutions, but do not correspondingly strengthen international ones, except in their unreliable appearance, again contributing to the political theater nature of &quot;international law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright conceded, without getting anything in return, that the case would be tried under Scottish law, which does not provide for the death penalty for convicted murderers.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Scotland undeniably has a jurisdictional claim in the case, because eleven of its citizens died on the ground near Lockerbie, the claim of the United States is far stronger, given that 189 of its citizens were among the 270 total fatalities. One can imagine valid reasons for deferring to the Scots, but to lose even the possibility of the death penalty without obtaining a single one of its objectives in exchange is a stunning failure of United States diplomacy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second concession (holding the trial in the Netherlands rather than in Scotland) also had adverse consequences. Leaks that the United States would accept the Pan Am 103 trial in a third country originally appeared in July 1998, before the terrorist bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet even after those bombings, and the subsequent military retaliation, the Clinton Administration gave way on the Pan Am 103 trial location, which had previously been non-negotiable, either in the United States or Scotland.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further concession is embodied in the August 1998, Security Council Resolution, namely that UN Secretary General Kofi Annan would name international &quot;observers&quot; to &quot;monitor&quot; the Scottish judges' conduct of the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*25]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever the individual qualifications of the five trial observers named to date--and one of them is reported to have served as a lawyer for Libya's UN Mission in New York  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --the fact remains that this concession is insulting to the entire Scottish judicial system. The idea that Scottish justice might not be up to Libya's high standards of due process, or that there is some &quot;international&quot; standard that is somehow better than Scotland's (and, implicitly, the United States') is truly remarkable. An equally negative precedent is the agreement by the United States and Great Britain that the defendants, if convicted and imprisoned, would be &quot;monitored&quot; by the United Nations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The notion that Scottish prisons might not meet Libyan standards is breathtaking. In nations where the rule of law prevails, prisoners generally are required to be treated humanely, are allowed to consult with counsel, to practice their religions, to receive legitimate visitors, and the like. For understandable security reasons, prisoners are not treated uniformly. Convicted murderers do face different circumstances than tax evaders. Nonetheless, Scotland still qualifies as a democratic, civilized-enough place that it can be expected to meet its own legal standards. These concessions raise the prospect that future controversial cases with even the slightest international coloration will be subject to calls for UN monitoring or oversight. What seems at first like a slight concession to Gadhafi's peculiar sensitivities is actually a potentially open-ended invitation to global entanglements in domestic criminal justice systems.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The result is a net </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">lowering</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of legal standards, not an enhancement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the foregoing examples, responsibility for a critical aspect of national self-governance has been taken away--or given away--from the nations most deeply affected. More precisely, the responsibility has migrated from the elected representatives of the people most directly affected to others, whose interests, opinions, motivations and capabilities are often far-removed from the consequences of the actions under scrutiny. Not only is authority being reduced, but so, too, is the inevitable legitimacy that flows from the decision-making of representative governments. In some purely theoretical sense, this migration may resemble a &quot;legal&quot; process, but it is hardly one that free citizens would knowingly choose if they fully understood what was happening to their liberty and authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c13">C. The Implications of Domesticizing &quot;International Law&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dissolving of nation-states into the European Union is important not only in its &quot;international&quot; impact, but also in the &quot;domestic&quot; impact on EU member states. They fully understand that transferring various &quot;competencies&quot; to Brussels reduces their respective national &quot;domestic&quot; authorities, and they do so openly, sometimes by treaty, and sometimes by explicitly amending their respective national constitutions. Indeed, the rapidity with which constitutions are being amended to conform to the EU's emerging shape makes these constitutions more like statutes, as sovereignty shifts from the nation-state to Brussels. And the practice of divesting themselves of authority in favor of multilateral institutions now extends outside the EU. Germany and France, for example, after signing the 1998 Statute of Rome creating the International Criminal Court, are in the process of amending their constitutions to conform them to the Statute.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American opponents of the nation-state are rarely so overt. Indeed, they face an entirely different and arguably far more difficult problem under the U. S. Constitution. Is it theoretically legitimate for a President to sign, and the Senate to ratify, a treaty creating an international structure superior to the Constitution? As discussed previously,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the answer is clearly &quot;no,&quot; at least not without an amendment to the Constitution, as Justice Black, writing for a Supreme Court plurality, said in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Reid</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Covert</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, &quot;This Court has regularly and uniformly recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the United States, it is politically inconceivable that anybody could advocate a treaty that would actually require amending the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*27]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Constitution. In fact, we may be the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">only</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> country in the world that cares so deeply about our constitutional autonomy, but we have good reason to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so dramatic as outright Constitutional amendment is the less visible but increasingly more pervasive approach of trying to establish domestic policy through international agreement. Although advocated because &quot;global&quot; problems require &quot;global&quot; solutions, the proposed policy changes are often precisely those that would be advanced whether there was a &quot;global&quot; aspect or not. These objectives are often impossible to achieve domestically (or almost insuperably difficult) through traditional political means, such as legislation, because there are too many opponents who can block Congressional action. Accordingly, the advocates turn to international agreements as a way to &quot;back door&quot; the United States' domestic political process, thus &quot;binding&quot; Congress and eliminating its ability to &quot;subvert&quot; the treaty objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One current variation on this theme is the argument, discussed above, that the United States is &quot;legally&quot; bound to pay whatever assessment is presented to it by the United Nations, because Congress lacks the power to authorize and appropriate a different amount.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under this variation, membership in the UN and adherence to Article 17 of the Charter strips Congress of its discretion over financial contributions and &quot;binds&quot; Congress to the level presented in the UN's assessment notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House of Representatives rejected precisely this argument 204 years ago. Several provisions of the Jay Treaty of 1796, establishing &quot;mixed commissions&quot; to address various issues, required appropriations to make them effective. Supporters of the Treaty argued that, since it had been duly ratified, Congress was obligated to make the necessary appropriations. Opponents, by contrast, argued that separate legislative action was required by the Constitutional provision that &quot;no money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historical discussion of the congressional debate over the Jay Treaty has concentrated on the struggle by Congress to obtain the negotiators' instructions. Nonetheless, while the debate was confused, at best, on several points, the financial question was also one of great significance. As it turned out, the opponents, led by Congressmen James Madison and Albert Gallatin, prevailed on the appropriations issue, certainly in the court of history.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the House appropriated the money necessary to implement the Treaty, it also adopted a Resolution that stated:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*28]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When a treaty stipulates regulations on any of the subjects submitted by the Constitution to the powers of Congress, it must depend for its execution as to such stipulations on a law or laws to be passed by Congress, and it is the constitutional right and duty of the House of Representatives in all such cases to deliberate on the expediency or inexpediency of carrying such treaty into effect, and to determine and act thereon as in their judgment may be most conducive to the public good.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, two centuries of House precedents confirm the legitimacy of the House and the Senate, making their own judgments on appropriations--or any other legislation--independent of any prior treaty ratification. Authorizing or appropriating less than the full amount of a UN agency's assessment is doing nothing more or less than what Madison and Gallatin successfully urged two centuries ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the idea that treaties, ratified alone by the Senate, can supplant the legislative role of the House of Representatives, in and of itself should demonstrate both the grave constitutional and political weaknesses of the &quot;back door&quot; approach to domestic legislation. The Supreme Court has already, at least in passing, noted this point:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A treaty is made by the President and the Senate. Statutes are made by the President, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The addition of the latter body to the other two in making a law certainly does not render it less entitled to respect in the matter of its repeal or modification than a treaty made by the other two. If there be any difference in this regard, it would seem to be in favor of an act in which all of the three bodies participate. And such is, in fact, the case in a declaration of war, which must be made by Congress, and which, when made, usually suspends or destroys existing treaties between the nations thus at war.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, this analysis is entirely consistent with an essentially unquestioned line of congressional practice that treaties can be voided or unilaterally modified by subsequent congressional action. The first example of such action took place shortly after the Jay Treaty controversy. In 1798, relations with France had deteriorated to the point that Congress voided previously existing treaties between that country and the United States. The key explanatory language of the repealing statute stressed that:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas the treaties concluded between the United States and France have been repeatedly violated on the part of the French Government; and the just claims of the United States &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*29]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for reparation of the injuries so committed have been refused, and their attempts to negotiate an amicable adjustment of all complaints between the two nations have been repelled with indignity; and whereas, under authority of the French Government, there is yet pursued against the United States a system of predatory violence, infracting the said treaties and hostile to the rights of a free and independent nation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where Congressional actions modifying treaties have been challenged judicially, there is an unbroken line of Supreme Court precedent holding that such legislative actions are entirely lawful and constitutional. Thus, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Chae Chan Ping</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a statute prohibiting the entry into the United States of certain Chinese laborers was challenged on the ground that it contravened existing treaties between the United States and the Emperor of China. The Supreme Court agreed that the challenged statute in fact violated the treaties indicated, but was not thereby invalid. The Court reasoned:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A treaty . . . is often merely promissory in its character, requiring legislation to carry its stipulations into effect. Such legislation will be open to future repeal or amendment. If the treaty operates by its own force, and relates to a subject within the power of Congress, it can be deemed in that particular only the equivalent of a legislative act, to be repealed or modified at the pleasure of Congress. In either case the last expression of the sovereign must control.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, Congress may exercise this authority for whatever reason it chooses: &quot;it is wholly immaterial to inquire whether it has, by the statute complained of, departed from the treaty or not; or, if it has, whether such departure was accidental or designed; and if the latter, whether the reasons therefor were good or bad.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though, to date, ultimately futile at stifling domestic political attitudes, the attractiveness of the &quot;back door&quot; still persists. A particularly vivid contemporary example of trying to obtain internationally what is &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*30]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  impossible to obtain domestically is the Kyoto Protocol on global warming.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many environmental groups wanted a series of changes in environmental and economic policy that they knew Congress, a messy, democratic institution, would reject. They concluded, logically from their tactical perspective, that it was much easier to persuade an international conference to adopt environmental standards that could then be presented to the Senate, saying in effect: &quot;Because the President has signed this international treaty, the credibility of the United States is on the line. Surely the Senate must ratify.&quot; In fact, the strategy at the Kyoto conference was to make the United States look isolated and intransigent, as a Greenpeace delegate said even before the opening gavel: &quot;There is a growing feeling that the U.S. is becoming the bully of the conference.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sure enough, when Vice President Gore arrived in Kyoto, he instructed the U.S. delegation to change its position.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there was a considerable delay before the Clinton Administration finally signed the Protocol and submitted it to the Senate,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it is now pending. Because political opposition in the Senate has remained unchanged, however, the Kyoto agreement is not going to be ratified, and implementing legislation is not going to be adopted. But now, the United States has been tactically out-maneuvered in the international arena, and made to look isolated. It suggests that, as a political tactic to obtain substantive policy change that cannot be obtained through domestic political activity, the international arena is much more attractive.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the example of Kyoto is further proof that &quot;international law&quot; today is very much about binding, restricting and limiting the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, there is already an emerging vehicle for this process in international &quot;civil society,&quot; a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that has astutely, if dishonestly, misappropriated the name of an important and legitimate component of national polities. &quot;Civil society&quot; as it currently functions in the international arena amounts to the collection of advocacy NGOs in a variety of fields such as human rights and the environment,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> something far different from the voluntary, non-business/non-labor, civic, religious and charitable associations that make up domestic &quot;civil society.&quot; What actually seems to be happening is that the international NGOs are becoming an alternative to national &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*31]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  governments as vehicles for decision-making.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In reality, however, it is precisely the detachment from governments that makes such a &quot;civil society&quot; so troubling, at least for democracies. Within each democratic government, political interests compete for power: the legitimate, constitutional authority flows from victory, in order to implement their policy preferences. In the international context, this includes the authority to negotiate on behalf of the entire nation, including opposing political forces that lost electorally. &quot;Civil society,&quot; by contrast, seeks to re-argue its preferred issues, by trying to leverage political power from outside of the democratic polities where they have been unsuccessful politically. This &quot;outside&quot; political power may well, over the long term, leave them in a stronger domestic position than their opponents, who have neither access to nor allies beyond their own countries. In effect, therefore, &quot;civil society&quot; attempts to renegotiate the basic constitutional issue of democracies--who governs?--to its own advantage.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An important contemporary example of precisely this leverage at work is the current international campaign against the use of the death penalty in the United States, aspects of which have been played out during the 2000 presidential campaign. Hofstra University law professor Peter Spiro, for example, has asserted that the U.S. death penalty &quot;is the area where American law 'most clearly is trespassing on crystallizing international norms.'&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without being diverted into an extensive argument about the pros and cons of the death penalty, there should be little doubt that the extent to which the death penalty has, in the last several years, been adopted and reaffirmed at the State and Federal levels, shows that the measure has strong public support. This support is not, to be sure, universal, and considerable controversy and debate still surrounds both the general subject and application of the death penalty in particular cases. Nonetheless, the decision to provide for the penalty in the current context has been made only after full debate and in the unchallenged exercise of democratic authority and legitimacy. Death penalty opponents obviously remain free to debate the issue, and to press for reconsideration, and they continue to do so actively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students of democratic theory might think that the results of this free and open process by which citizens and their elected representatives have made their policy decisions should be sufficient. They would be wrong. Death penalty opponents have turned outside of the United States Constitution and polity to try to find added support for their campaign inside the United States &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*32]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in two ways. First, they have attempted to use international agreements--such as the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --in litigation against the application of the death penalty, and second, they have tried to mobilize </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">international</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> public opinion against the prevailing majority view </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">within</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first strategy was applied in the 1998 case of Angel Breard, a Paraguayan national, convicted in Virginia of a particularly brutal murder: the killing of a single woman whom he followed home and stabbed five times in the neck, following an attempted rape.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guilt was unquestioned because of Breard's own confession at trial in June 1993 (against the advice of both his experienced, court-appointed attorney and his Paraguayan mother), and because of extensive DNA testing and microscopic evidence from his victim's corpse. Breard had been living in the United States since 1986, and it was uncontested that he had a good command of English. He had almost immediate and continuing access to his family and counsel from the time of his arrest in August 1992. A jury sentenced Breard to death, pursuant to Virginia law, because of &quot;future dangerousness&quot; and the &quot;vileness&quot; of his crime.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breard then received the benefit of every possible judicial review. His jury conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Virginia;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States Supreme Court denied review.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Breard then brought a state habeas corpus petition, which was twice denied by the trial court. The state Supreme Court also twice rejected his habeas appeals.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During all of these proceedings, Breard never raised the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. In analogous cases, such a procedural default would bar a person from using certain defenses in later proceedings, even defenses based on the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only in a new habeas corpus petition, filed in a federal district court in Virginia, filed by five new court-appointed attorneys, did Breard finally raise the Vienna convention issue. The precise question at issue--and the principal point of attack for Breard's counsel and their sympathizers--was whether Virginia's failure to advise Breard at the time of his arrest that he could consult with Paraguayan consular officials, pursuant to the Vienna &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*33]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Convention, was enough to set aside his conviction. There was never any claim that Virginia had denied such access, only that it had not informed Breard of the option. Breard's new petition was rejected.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and also denied Breard's petition for rehearing. Paraguay filed a separate federal suit to enjoin Virginia from proceeding, but the district court dismissed the case,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of this should be very surprising, since the preamble to the Vienna Convention itself expressly states that its subject is &quot;consular relations privileges and immunities,&quot; and that the purpose of such privileges and immunities &quot;is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">not to benefit individuals</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but to ensure the efficient performance of functions by consular posts.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, the Supreme Court did not find the case difficult, denying Breard's and Paraguay's petitions for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and applications for a stay, and rejecting the contention that any error in Breard's case caused him any real harm:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even were Breard's Vienna Convention claim properly raised and proven, it is extremely doubtful that the violation should result in the overturning of a final judgment of conviction without some showing that the violation had an effect on the trial. . . . In this case no such showing could even arguably be made.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court also held that international law generally recognizes that &quot;the procedural rules of the forum State govern the implementation of the treaty in that State. . . . This proposition is embodied in the Vienna Convention itself.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, in thirteen distinct decisions, by five different courts in four separate proceedings, in litigation lasting five years and eight months, Breard either failed to raise the Vienna Convention or had his arguments about the Convention rejected. But this was not the end of the matter. Although Paraguay and the Department of State had been in diplomatic conversation about Breard since April 1996, when Paraguay first contacted the Department asking for information, Paraguay (assisted by U.S. lawyers referred by Breard's domestic American counsel) waited for two years until April 3, 1998 to file suit in the International Court of Justice (&quot;ICJ&quot;), a mere eleven days before Breard's scheduled execution. Mirroring arguments made by the Solicitor General in the Supreme Court, State Department lawyers &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*34]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  argued that the ICJ had no jurisdiction to hear Paraguay's case, that Paraguay was wrong on the merits, and that the stay of Breard's execution sought from the ICJ was impermissible. The ICJ, in response, called upon the United States not to execute Breard while it considered the applicability of the Vienna Convention,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and even Secretary of State Madeleine Albright got into the act. She took the extraordinary step of writing to Virginia Governor James Gilmore to ask him to stay the execution, for two reasons. First, she said that executing Breard &quot;could lead some countries to conclude incorrectly that the U.S. does not take [the Vienna Convention] seriously,&quot; which could pose risks to citizens of the United States overseas. Second, given the ICJ opinion, she said that executing Breard &quot;could be seen as a denial by the United States of the significance of international law and the [ICJ's] processes in its international relations.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Governor Gilmore nor the Supreme Court were impressed, and Breard was executed on schedule on April 14. The Court's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">per curiam</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opinion said unequivocally that, if Governor Gilmore &quot;wishes to wait for the decision of the ICJ, that is his prerogative. But nothing in our existing case law allows us to make that choice for him.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, Secretary Albright's concern for &quot;international law&quot; relating to citizens of the United States traveling abroad was entirely misplaced. Any foreign government with even a minimal knowledge of due process (by any civilized definition) will understand that Breard received all possible legal protections, procedurally and substantively, in more than ample measure. Governments without such minimal knowledge will not be deterred by the Vienna Convention in any case. If respect for the rule of law is generally absent in a country, there is no reason to believe that adherence to the Vienna Convention might be the sole exception. Moreover, the Convention does not guarantee that trials abroad will be conducted by U.S. standards, but only that American citizens must be advised that they can consult with consular officials. It is fanciful to believe that consular officials--as opposed to experienced criminal defense attorneys--can offer the real assistance needed by United States' citizens in legal trouble overseas. Albright's real failure, and those who supported the intrusion of &quot;international law&quot; into the Breard case, was ignoring the legitimate, indeed overwhelming, national interest in honoring our own laws and our own Constitution.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second strategy, mobilizing international opinion against the death penalty, has come most recently in the form of a rapporteur authorized by the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*35]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  United Nations Human Rights Commission to investigate death penalty law and practice in the United States.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although this Human Rights Commission rapporteur (and others who have recently investigated the United States on &quot;religious intolerance&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n136</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and &quot;violence against women&quot;  n137) could undoubtedly fi</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>nd</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more useful work to do investigating other UN member states, his deployment here emphasizes the workings of what can only be described as an effort to subvert the use of the death penalty in the United States. To begin with, the rapporteur's explicit mandate covered only &quot;extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions.&quot; Can anyone seriously argue that any level of the United States government has, in recent years, carried out an execution in such a lawless manner? One may argue (incorrectly, in my view) that the death penalty falls disproportionately on one group or another, but there is simply no credible argument that the administration of the death penalty in the United States is &quot;extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the rapporteur himself gives his real agenda away when he writes in his report that &quot;information concerning the extension of the scope and the reintroduction of death penalty statutes in several states prompted&quot; his visit.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n138</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This admission reflects unambiguously the pursuit of a political agenda, or is otherwise a confession of just how undisciplined an international organization the UN is. There are &quot;extrajudicial executions&quot; in the world, and the UN's inability to focus its scarce resources where the real problems exist is telling evidence for many citizens of the United States of fundamental structural flaws in the institution itself. Further evidence is found in the rapporteur's unbelievable recommendation that our government &quot;include a human rights component in training programmes for members of the judiciary.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n139</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While one unguided rapporteur (or even several) is hardly a threat to the Republic, there can be no argument that something else more troubling is at work here. The rapporteur, in his forty-page, single-spaced, heavily footnoted report about his &quot;mission&quot; to the United States, is quite explicit: &quot;The United Nations had gradually shifted from the position of a neutral observer . . . to a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*36]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  position favouring the eventual abolition of the death penalty.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n140</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most United States' citizens will wonder how the UN arrived at such a position, which was certainly never debated in Congress. Moreover, how and when did the &quot;United Nations&quot; ever come to believe that it had authority to make such judgments in the first place? Whether abolition of the death penalty is the personal opinion of some rapporteur from Senegal is, of course, completely irrelevant to the domestic debate on the issue. But the rapporteur and his allies are clearly trying to do something more here: leverage the stature and legal &quot;authority&quot; of the UN (such as they are) into that debate, through his finding that the use of the death penalty in the United States violates &quot;international law.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n141</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rapporteur goes on to recommend, in light of his findings, that &quot;the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers&quot; make a visit to the United States.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n142</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also recommends that our police receive &quot;training on international standards on law enforcement and human rights.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n143</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is not alone in facing these pressures from international organizations. Australia has recently come under criticism for &quot;mandatory sentencing&quot; laws in Western Australia and the Northern Territory by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (&quot;CERD&quot;), which asserts that Aboriginal citizens are adversely affected by the practice.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n144</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is not a case of reporting on &quot;human rights&quot; violations by a totalitarian state, but is instead a direct and unambiguous interference in the internal affairs of a democratic UN member. Citizens can and should debate the merits of mandatory sentencing, and its impact on racial minorities, and Australians are perfectly capable of making up their minds on the subject without help (or implicit pressure) from outsiders. Moreover, CERD itself is not composed of member UN governments, but eighteen &quot;experts&quot; acting in their individual capacities, elected by signatories to an international convention.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n145</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has no more international authority or legitimacy than any random collection of eighteen people at an intersection outside UN headquarters in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One could well ask why CERD could not find more important work to do in any number of other countries where problems of racial discrimination are not only more severe but, because of the lack of basic democratic freedoms, far less likely to be resolved satisfactorily. In fact, CERD's comments on Australia epitomize the larger pattern of action in the name of &quot;human rights&quot; that is having the perverse effect of taking critical political and legal &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*37]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  decisions out of the hands of nation-states by overriding their own internal decision-making processes and effectively superseding national constitutional standards. But it is both wrong and excessively defensive to act as though international &quot;human rights&quot; standards should reflexively apply when the constitutional application of democratic principles produces a different result. Does CERD possess greater wisdom and maturity than the Australian electorate? Do Australian officials really trust a group of &quot;international experts&quot; to produce better policy for Australia (or its components) than their own voters? Why should Australia feel any need to conform to someone else's definition of &quot;human rights&quot; or good public policy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both of these international interferences in democratic societies are illegitimate. We should understand clearly that to whatever extent the death-penalty rapporteur's or CERD's efforts have an impact, they represent a shift away from a constitution-based decision-making structure toward one that subjects us to the vagaries of world opinion.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n146</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As with the examples in the previous section, authority (and, therefore, the ability to confer legitimacy, a central element of anything that can reasonable be called &quot;law&quot;) is being taken from citizens and their elected representatives and being sent overseas. A free people should simply find this unacceptable. Ironically, the death-penalty rapporteur in particular picked his target accurately. It is precisely because the United States is not simply one among 189 members of the United Nations that our debate on the death penalty, as on so many other domestic policy issues, makes us the focus of so much effort to bind our policies through international constraints. Every time the United States bends its knee to this kind of international pressure, it sets a significant--and detrimental--precedent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c13">D. Restraining the United States From Using Its Military Power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another hidden agenda is making the unilateral use of United States' force harder by raising the political and military risks and costs of such action, thus making it less attractive to senior decisions makers; requiring other nations (whether through the Security Council or other mechanisms) to participate in the consideration of the use of force by the United States; and locking the United States into interpretations of &quot;international law&quot; rather than relying on Constitutional or statutory reasoning. Since the national security of the United States is the ultimate responsibility of its central government, the weakening of that authority is perhaps the most definitive and most crippling paralysis of &quot;international law&quot; of all the examples discussed herein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*38]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">1. The Case of Former Yugoslavia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider NATO's bombing campaign against former Yugoslavia, which was not authorized by the Security Council. Although many opposed the NATO action because there were insufficient national interests of the United States at stake, there was almost no disagreement here that, within the terms of international law, the U.S. was perfectly justified.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n147</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By contrast, several legal academics argued that NATO violated Article 2(3) of the UN Charter, which states that &quot;Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means,&quot; and Article 2(4) which requires that member states &quot;refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n148</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the contrary, however, nothing in the Charter requires any member to give up its fundamental ability to protect its own national interest. Article 51 expressly recognizes the &quot;inherent right of individual or collective self-defense&quot; for all members. While Article 51 applies specifically when a member faces armed attack, the &quot;inherent right&quot; it recognizes is far broader. Most United States' citizens--in Congress and the general public--would be very surprised to hear that by ratifying the UN Charter over five decades ago, they had given up their ability to use military force to advance and defend what we define to be in our national interests. Such a conclusion certainly permits other nations to make a parallel analysis on their own behalf, but that is what most of them do anyway, and it is inevitable in a world that still consists of nation-states. To some, this may not be a pretty picture, but that is a matter of aesthetics, not law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, the Clinton Administration and its supporters asserted the &quot;right of humanitarian intervention&quot; to justify military operations to prevent ethnic cleansing or potential genocide, but this &quot;right&quot; is even more malleable than most principles of international law and is a treacherous ground on which to stand. Its high-minded morality is especially susceptible to cynical manipulation, as Hitler might have done to justify intervention to protect Sudetan Germans from &quot;mistreatment&quot; in Czechoslovakia. Today, ultranationalist Russian governments could assert &quot;humanitarian&quot; grounds to intervene in the affairs of the new states of the former USSR, which have substantial Russian minorities. This Russian concern is far from hypothetical and already evident in several former Soviet republics from Georgia to Tajikistan.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n149</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*39]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If humanitarian grounds sufficed for Clinton Administration decision-makers to justify NATO attacks in former Yugoslavia, these grounds can be amply supported &quot;legally&quot; as legitimate United States' national interests under Article 51. One may agree or disagree that such &quot;interests&quot; justify the risk of losing American citizens' lives for something so tangential to traditional security concerns, but that is policy disagreement, not a matter of law. Likewise, one might argue that the foregoing reading of Article 51 effectively eviscerates the provision, by allowing it to be interpreted so broadly that almost any pretext can be used to satisfy it. Such an argument, however, misses the basic tenet of Article 51, which acknowledges the &quot;inherent right of individual and collective self-defense.&quot; Surely, if an &quot;inherent right&quot; means anything, it means the ability of each member to decide its interests without supervision or review. Otherwise, the right is hardly &quot;inherent&quot; in any coherent sense of the word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside of the United States, however, that was an unpopular position. During the NATO air war against Yugoslavia, Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed the predominant view that &quot;unless the Security Council is restored to its pre-eminent position as the sole source of legitimacy on the use of force, we are on a dangerous path to anarchy.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n150</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortly thereafter, in a report to the United Nations' membership, Annan repeated his argument, stating that military actions (such as the NATO air campaign) amounted to threats to the &quot;very core of the international security system. . . . Only the Charter provides a universally legal basis for the use of force.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n151</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Implicitly, therefore, in Annan's view, NATO's failure to obtain Council authorization made its actions illegitimate, which is what those pursuing the hidden agenda want to hear: while one cannot stop the United States from using force because it is so big and powerful, one can ensure that it is illegitimate absent Security Council authorization. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, was even more pointed, announcing: &quot;Civilian casualties are human rights victims.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n152</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She asked, &quot;If it is not possible to ascertain whether civilian buses are on bridges, should those bridges be blown?&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n153</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her basic objection, however, was not to civilian casualties, but to the bombing itself. During the war, she said, &quot;NATO remains the sole judge of what is or is not acceptable to bomb,&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n154</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and she did not mean it as a compliment. Even more basically, she, like Annan, asserted &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*40]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that NATO's lack of Security Council authorization violated international law:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It surely must be right for the Security Council of the United Nations to have a say in whether a prolonged bombing campaign in which the bombers choose their target at will is consistent with the principle of legality under the Charter of the United Nations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n155</SUP></SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Robinson's peripheral position in international affairs did not expose her to the full measure of criticism that one might have expected, but her elaboration of Annan's basic position further evidences the direction the Secretary General was traveling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, in fact, both Annan and Robinson are badly mistaken, their analysis being unsupported either by the UN Charter or by fifty-five years of UN practice. Not surprisingly, most of the &quot;legal&quot; criticism of the NATO bombing campaign came from the academic left, even though, as a political and policy matter, the political left (and at least some of the political right) in the United States supported the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military action.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n156</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, in the summer of 1999, European and Canadian law professors filed a &quot;complaint&quot; with Louise Arbour, then the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (&quot;ICTY&quot;), alleging that NATO's use of force was an illegal act of aggression and that several actions during the aerial campaign specifically amounted to war crimes or crimes against humanity.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n157</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arbour ordered an internal staff review of these allegations, resulting in the preparation of a staff report. Although Arbour's successor, Carla Del Ponte, in response to news reports, subsequently denied that she was conducting a &quot;formal inquiry&quot; into NATO's actions, her carefully-worded statement only raised more questions about what she actually was doing.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n158</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Del Ponte's subsequent declination to indict NATO officials does not finally resolve the matter.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n159</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) hoping to change Pentagon behavior as much as the international &quot;rules&quot; themselves, through the threat of prosecution, continued the assault. They hope to constrain military options, and thus lower the potential effectiveness &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*41]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of such actions, or raise the costs to successively more unacceptable levels by increasing the legal risks and liabilities perceived by top civilian and military planners of the United States and its allies undertaking military action. Indeed, the ICTY Prosecutor's review of the allegations against NATO is a virtual road map to the future role of NGOs in pressuring and cajoling the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) into adopting their worldview (thus providing yet another reason to reject the ICC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, for example, were quite willing to make the judgments Mrs. Del Ponte had avoided, following the path blazed by Mary Robinson. Amnesty asserted less than a week after Del Ponte's announcement that &quot;NATO forces violated the laws of war leading to cases of unlawful killing of civilians.&quot; The NGO complained loudly about NATO attacks on a &quot;civilian&quot; television transmitter in Belgrade, even though it served the Milosevic regime's propaganda purposes.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n160</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, Human Rights Watch had earlier concluded that NATO violated international law, but stopped short of labeling its actions as &quot;war crimes.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n161</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another recent report, this NGO announced its opposition to the sale by the United States to Israel of air-to-ground missiles, because of the Israeli &quot;war crime&quot; of attacking Lebanese civilian targets.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n162</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, much the same could also be said about air attacks by the United States during the Persian Gulf War, aimed at destroying critical communications and transportation infrastructure inside Iraq, in order to deny it to Saddam's military. If these targets are now &quot;off limits,&quot; the United States' military will be far weaker than it would otherwise be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is precisely the agenda of many in the &quot;human rights&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The events leading to the internal ICTY staff report are a virtual road map to the future role of NGOs in pressuring and cajoling future national and international prosecutors. It is unacceptable to begin with that a small group of academic ideologues could have moved the ICTY Prosecutor even to the extent they have. Emerging ICC procedures, for example, already contemplate an even larger role for NGOs, which will inevitably provide the dominant ideological compass for the Prosecutor.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n163</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Law Professor Diane F. Orentlicher in effect gave the game away when she crowed, &quot;the future the United States government feared is here sooner than it expected.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n164</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*42]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The future arrived for the United Kingdom shortly thereafter when it was sued in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg by families of Argentine sailors who died in the 1982 sinking of the Argentine battleship </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">General Belgrano</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the Falklands War.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n165</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plaintiffs argue that torpedoing the warship violated the 1907 Hague Convention  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n166</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> because it was sunk outside of a 200-mile &quot;exclusion zone&quot; around the Falklands (known as the Malvinas in Argentina), unilaterally declared by the United Kingdom, and thus not in a legitimate theater of operations. Although it is merely a &quot;human rights&quot; lawsuit that seeks monetary damages on behalf of the deceased Argentines, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Belgrano</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> litigation is an entirely predictable adjunct to recent efforts to criminalize the use of force in international affairs. Nonetheless, this case raises several new, unacceptable precedents, such as second-guessing a military decision eighteen years after it was made in the heat of combat. No civilians or civilian targets were even arguably involved. Complaining today that sailors on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Belgrano</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> died as a result is a direct challenge not to one particular military decision, but to the very fact of the war itself, which is not a &quot;legal&quot; complaint, but a political one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the belligerent governments, both now indisputably democracies, have already resolved their general differences over the Falklands and their specific differences over the sinking of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">General Belgrano</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Diplomatic relations between the combatants were restored in 1990, and in 1994 Argentina agreed that the incident was &quot;a legal act of war.&quot; The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Belgrano's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> captain himself has said: &quot;I realized from the outset that the 200-mile limit did not exclude danger or risks. It was the same in or out.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n167</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One might question the wisdom of the outcome, but what is not legitimate is for such public policy questions to be removed from the political field and assigned to judges, especially international ones. This is not simply a technical, legal question, but a basic issue of the allocation of power and responsibility between the political and judicial branches of government, with the notable point that the judicial &quot;branch&quot; involved here is not part of any recognized government. One can predict with confidence that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Belgrano</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case will not be the last of its kind filed in Strasbourg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*43]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">2. International &quot;Justice&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Criminal Court (ICC),  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n168</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which the Clinton Administration has not tried to join, although it dearly wants to,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n169</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> purportedly has jurisdiction even over individual officials from countries that do not agree to it. One of the ICC's most striking aspects is the extent to which the rhetoric of its supporters parallels the 1945 rhetoric of the supporters of the International Court of Justice. Among that court's many failings, its worst is the crassly political way its members are selected, by horse trading among General Assembly members, and the equally political way in which its judgments are crafted. Exactly the same will be true of the ICC, convincingly demonstrating why it is fundamentally a political and not a legal institution. In this important sense, the ICC is the logical institutional end-point of the doctrine of &quot;universal jurisdiction&quot; discussed above.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n170</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the history of the allegations against NATO in the Yugoslav air campaign, briefly recounted above, show just how intensely politicized such matters will inevitably be, and that in fact, top leaders in the United States, not just individual soldiers, are the real targets of the ICC. ICC advocates had previously responded to such arguments by decrying them as scare tactics, scoffing at comparisons between the former U.S. independent counsel statute and the ICC's prosecutor. Invariably, they had pointed to the professionalism and self-control shown by ICTY prosecutors to cast doubt on concerns about the dangers posed by the essentially independent ICC prosecutor. Even though the ICTY Prosecutor subsequently declined to indict any NATO officials, she said carefully, &quot;although some mistakes were made by NATO, I am very satisfied that there were was no deliberate targeting of civilian or unlawful military targets by NATO during the bombing campaign.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n171</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Mrs. Del Ponte also stated explicitly that she was not opining on the basic &quot;legality&quot; of the NATO campaign, which was &quot;not our task and is not part of our brief, just as we cannot decide on general responsibilities of countries or international organizations. It is our task to pinpoint possible individual responsibilities.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n172</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, by actively considering the complaints, and by effectively rejecting their substantive allegations, the Prosecutor nonetheless implicitly &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*44]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  concluded that she had jurisdiction over the incidents alleged. In short, she was asserting that, had there been sufficient evidence or credible allegations of war crimes by NATO personnel, she would have had the requisite authority to launch prosecutions against them. While it may comfort some in the short term that no NATO officials were prosecuted this time, the longerterm repercussions are far more troubling. Many in Congress were surprised to find that the ICTY, created in 1993 at the behest of the Clinton Administration, has assumed jurisdiction over more than Balkan war criminals. The idea that the Security Council can create tribunals of limited scope and authority, and exercise authority over the tribunals once created, is already a casualty of Del Ponte's vindication of NATO's bombing campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, just a few days later, the New York Times reported that tribunal officials were saying &quot;privately that they hoped their report would cause NATO countries to review their rules of engagement in order to lessen the chances of civilian casualties.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n173</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once, merely prosecutors, they have become military strategists--a new goal for aspiring law students and professors. Moreover, Del Ponte qualified her declination to prosecute by saying that &quot;some mistakes were made by NATO,&quot; and at least as stated publicly, that she based her decision on the absence of intent, perhaps the easiest of the elements of any criminal offense for a prosecutor to consider subjectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor have the actual operations of the Yugoslav and Rwanda tribunals been free from criticism, criticism that foretells in significant ways how an ICC might actually operate. A UN experts' study (known as the &quot;Ackerman Report,&quot; after its chairman) noted considerable room for improvement in the work of the tribunals.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n174</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Report notes that, in 1999, ICTY's annual budget was $ 94,103,800, covering a total of 838 assessed-budget personnel, and that ICTR's budget amounted to $ 68,531,900, with 779 assessed-budget personnel. While these figures are not well known in Congress or in other UN member governments, they most certainly show that neither court is starved for funding. Even with these large expenditures and personnel, however, the pace of the Tribunals' work has been slow. The Ackerman Report states that &quot;ideally, the trial of an accused should commence and be concluded expeditiously following an indictment. But that has not generally been the case in ICTY or ICTR.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n175</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, ICC opponents have warned that the court will be subjected to intense political pressures by parties to disputes seeking to use the tribunal to achieve their own non-judicial objectives, such as score-settling and &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*45]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  gaining advantage in subsequent phases of the conflict. The Ackerman Report, in discussing the ICTY's quandary about whether to pursue &quot;leadership&quot; cases or low-level suspects, points out precisely how such political pressures work, and their consequences: &quot;Unavoidable early political pressures on the Office of the Prosecutor to act against perpetrators of war crimes . . . led to the first trials beginning in 1995 against relatively minor figures. And while important developments . . . have resulted from these cases, the cost has been high. Years have elapsed and not all of the cases have been completed.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n176</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In short, political pressures on the Tribunals, to which they respond, are very real threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, one important result of the Prosecutor's focus on leadership cases, in her own view, has been &quot;to further worsen the difficulties in obtaining state cooperation, particularly in the ICTY region.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n177</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This finding underscores the central problem of inserting criminal-law institutions into still-unresolved political or military contexts, while believing naively that such tribunals can function impartially, like a municipal traffic court. The Ackerman Report makes clear that, in such unsettled contexts, the leadership defendants &quot;are viewed by many, however mistakenly, as heroic rather than criminal figures warranting prosecution. Local politicians see cooperation with the ICTY in such cases as political suicide.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n178</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The experts go on to identify another central reality that ICC advocates too often, and too naively, ignore: &quot;If there is insufficient political resolve in the region and elsewhere to implement the mandate of the Security Council, the Prosecutor's policy of focusing on top leadership may, paradoxically, be self-defeating.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n179</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ackerman Report explores many other aspects of the ICTY/ICTR experience that have direct applicability to the ICC, notably the integration of the Prosecutor and the Chambers: &quot;Unlike the prevailing situation in national jurisdictions, the Prosecutor, while independent in many respects, is an organ of the Tribunals, and to a degree is integrated into their rules.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n180</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, the Registry (which essentially comprises the support structures for the Tribunals, including incarceration), because of its &quot;unusual dual role, is occasionally faced with seeming conflicts in discharging its responsibilities.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n181</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are serious matters, too often dismissed simply as minor administrative concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the Ackerman Report's findings thus reflect the inherent difficulties of the multilateral versus national prosecution of alleged war criminals. It says, for example that creation of the ICTY and ICTR &quot;almost &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*46]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  inevitably presented issues either unforeseen or not fully appreciated, issues that would unfold only through the often costly process of trial and error.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n182</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This cautionary language is, of course, directly applicable to the United States' consideration of the ICC. Although ICC proponents predict almost nothing but smooth sailing, the actual experience of the ICTY and the ICTR proves that much of what lies ahead for so unparalleled an institution is simply unforeseeable, and that the level of risk is accordingly quite high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ICC supporters argue that the threat of liability to national decision-makers will deter them from undertaking illegal actions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n183</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the Statute is so vague that no one can confidently advise a President of the United States what is illegal and what is not. This is a way of binding and constraining the United States, and one can already see its limiting effects, at least indirectly. NATO's Yugoslav air campaign shows the inhibiting effect, as evidenced by testimony of a key U.S. military official, of arguments that protect even legitimate targets from bombing, or that restrict, and perhaps dangerously so, the timing of such operations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n184</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, it may well be that NATO was more inhibited by &quot;international law&quot; in the Kosovo campaign than was the Milosevic regime in Belgrade, thus proving that those who don't really need to be deterred will be, and those that should be the principle targets of international &quot;justice&quot; will simply ignore it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbs (and others) were already facing charges for crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed in Bosnia before the Kosovo air war began. If there ever were a case where the prospect of ultimate prosecution and sentencing should have been palpable to senior political and military leaders, those in Belgrade should have understood best of all. Nonetheless, the Yugoslav leadership proceeded with its campaigns against civilians in Kosovo as if the ICTY did not exist. Even more importantly, the Milosevic regime not only ignored the threat of NATO military action, it dramatically stepped up the pace of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo after the NATO bombing actually began. It defies credulity to believe that a regime not deterred by precision-guided bombs and missiles literally falling on its head will somehow be deterred by the threat of war-crimes prosecutions at some distant, hazy point down the road. Nonetheless, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's ill-disguised desire for the United States to join the ICC continues to assert itself. Her repeated threats of bombing Serbia if it failed to sign the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*47]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rambouillet Accords having failed, she simply turned to the next set of threats on her clipboard, which failed as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c13">3. Arms Control</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, the 1997 Land Mine Convention, which essentially prohibits anti-personnel land mines, was also signed by almost every nation except the United States, to the Clinton Administration's chagrin. The Convention's advocates are attempting to make the United States' use of land mines in defense, principally of anti-tank land mines, appear illegitimate.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n185</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A related development occurred in the context of the Senate's rejection of the proposed Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n186</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the first major international agreement to be rejected since the Versailles Treaty.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n187</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather than accepting defeat, the Clinton Administration insisted instead that it was still pressing for ratification--a political event which would truly be the equivalent of Hell freezing over--and that, pursuant to Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n188</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (which the United States has also not ratified) the United States was bound to comply with the terms of the rejected treaty and forego nuclear testing. Apart from the separation-of-powers issues legitimately and acutely raised by this bizarre analysis of the existing domestic political landscape in the United States, the Clinton Administration's approach rested entirely on the purportedly binding force of &quot;customary international law.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n189</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nowhere publicly did the President or his senior officials invoke his Constitutional authority as Commander in Chief, which undeniably provides plenary authority to declare a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear testing, as a justification for this policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Clinton Administration's CTBT reasoning, it could also declare itself bound by the &quot;customary international law&quot; force of the widely accepted Land Mine Convention, and thus bind the United States not only without ratification, but even without signing by the Executive Branch.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n190</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*48]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  peculiar approach to international agreements must undoubtedly spring from concealed philosophical sources within the Administration, which have not been revealed as of this writing, but which quite probably also contain other threats to the independent exercise of judgment by the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. CONCLUSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;agenda&quot; of constraining the United States through international law is neither carefully planned nor entirely coherent, but it is an unmistakably discernible tendency. In fact, the tendency has friends in high places. Two years ago, at his speech at the United Nations, President Clinton said, &quot;the forces of global integration are a great tide, inexorably wearing away the established order of things.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n191</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is hard to say exactly what that means, but the thrust is clear: global integration is &quot;out there,&quot; it is sweeping over us, and those who stand against it are on the wrong side of history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lessons we should draw are clear: the way to deny the conclusions--the consequences of the growth of international law--is to deny the assumptions, and to argue that the underpinnings of international law rest on unacceptable premises for peoples who believe they are entitled to be free. This is why the relationship between international law, whatever it is, and the United States Constitution remains so central. Three possibilities exist in theory. First, international law is subordinate to the Constitution, a formulation that would make it essentially trivial for our purposes. Second, international law is equal to the Constitution, a formulation that would lead to chaos, because two such bodies of law cannot function as equivalents. Third, international law is superior to the Constitution; its requirements override the Constitution, and trump our constitutional arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If asked, &quot;Does international law trump national constitutions?,&quot; most international lawyers would say, &quot;Of course!&quot; Most American citizens would emphatically disagree, however. We should be unashamed, unapologetic, uncompromising American constitutional hegemonists. International law is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> superior to, and does not trump, the Constitution. The rest of the world may not like that approach, but abandoning it is the first step to abandoning the United States of America. International law is not law; it is a series of political and moral arrangements that stand or fall on their own merits, and anything else is simply theology and superstition masquerading as law.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c23"><SPAN CLASS="c20">n97&nbsp; Yet another concession, highly controversial in the United States, involves a February 17, 1999, letter sent by Secretary General Annan, which essentially guaranteed to Gadhafi that he would not be linked to the murders at the trial. Annan's letter has only recently been made public, but it reflects that Libya's &quot;understanding&quot; of the arrangements for the two defendants is fully shared by the United States and the United Kingdom. Secretary Albright had previously refused requests from members of Congress, families of the Pan Am 103 victims, and journalists for a copy of the letter, which had been retrospectively classified by the Department of State. In unambiguous terms, the Secretary General's letter insulates Gadhafi from criminal liability for the bombing, which many believe he personally ordered. An attachment to Annan's letter containing the &quot;understanding&quot; states: &quot;The two persons will not be used to undermine the Libyan regime.&quot; Certainly, the United States has, at times, decided not to proceed with criminal trials that might have had an adverse impact on national security. Because of concerns about protecting intelligence sources and methods, or because of overriding foreign policy priorities, even clearly winnable prosecutions have been abandoned. Such decisions reflect tough assessments as to when critical national interests legitimately trump criminal justice priorities. But what the United States and the United Kingdom have done here is something far different. These concessions to Gadhafi are made to a potential defendant, or at least a co-conspirator, in the murder that is the very subject of the investigation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c27">Id.</SPAN></P>

In 1999, the American Journal of International Law published a Symposium on Method in International Law.  The organizers sought to &quot;provide a greater grasp of the major theories of international law currently shared by scholars&quot; and to apply these theories to a concrete legal problem specifically &quot;the question of individual accountability for violations of human dignity committed in internal conflict. ...  Is it nevertheless possible to restore order and meaning, or, in the words of the late Yale Law Professor Robert Cover, to affirm &quot;the imagined triumph of the normative universe&quot;?  Is it possible to reconnect the victim - and perhaps even the perpetrator - to the larger community after &quot;world-destroying pain&quot;?  ...  Just as the Enlightenment sought to justify the power of Western culture, and its devastating legacy of imperialism, post-Cold War international law seeks to justify the power of late capitalism, which seems to be conspicuously less vigilant about &quot;violations of human dignity&quot; if cheap oil is at stake. ...  According to the modern metanarrative, international law discourages genocide, the complete denial of human dignity, on the one hand, by encouraging the fullest recognition of human dignity through human rights law, on the other. ... &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Martyrs insist in the face of overwhelming force that if there is to be continuing life, it will not be on the terms of the tyrant's law. Law is the projection of an imagined future upon reality. Martyrs require that any future they possess will be on the terms of the law to which they are committed (God's law). And the miracle of the suffering of the martyrs is their insistence on the law to which they are committed, even in the face of world-destroying pain. Their triumph - which may well be partly imaginary - is the imagined triumph of the normative universe - of Torah, Nomos - over the material world of death and pain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. Introduction<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In 1999, the American Journal of International Law published a Symposium on Method in International Law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organizers sought to &quot;provide a greater grasp of the major theories of international law currently shared by scholars&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and to apply these theories to a concrete legal problem specifically &quot;the question of individual accountability for violations of human dignity committed in internal conflict.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The seven methods selected, with many lawyerly disclaimers and caveats, were legal positivism, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the New Haven School, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> international legal process, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> critical legal studies, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*317]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  international law and international relations, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> feminist jurisprudence, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and law and economics. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next issue of the Journal, appropriately if predictably, carried letters from three respected members of the international legal community, pointing out omissions or diplomatically thanking the co-editors for affirming the authors' own approaches to international law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This Article is like both kinds of letters (but longer) in that I both regret the omission of postmodern international law (&quot;PIL&quot;) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and thank the co-editors for exemplifying (and, in my view, vindicating) it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unlike both kinds of letters, of course, in that it is not addressed to the co-editors. Rather, it is addressed to an audience which includes those who do not necessarily share the assumptions of the &quot;international legal community,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and who may not be fluent in its dialect. Grounded in PIL's insistence on questioning assumptions and challenging boundaries, finding an accessible vocabulary takes on a terrible urgency in the context of &quot;violations of human dignity.&quot; Any legal response to such violations must above all be intelligible to the law's targets and to those who harbor them. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While neither can be assumed to be familiar with international law, PIL's affinity for the vernacular makes it more accessible than the often esoteric language of the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*318]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Symposium. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The omission of PIL from the symposium was fitting, accordingly, because PIL did not fit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its omission was fitting for other reasons as well. First, as I have explained elsewhere, PIL is the method of choice of the &quot;omitted,&quot; the excluded, because it focuses on those at the margins rather than on those at the center. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, PIL is necessarily an &quot;afterword&quot; because it comments on and reacts to the modernity that precedes it. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Third, related but distinct, PIL comes &quot;afterwards&quot;; that is, after the end of the modern international institution-building period which began after World War II and ended with the end of the Cold War. Fourth, more portentously, PIL is &quot;after words&quot;; i.e., it recognizes that words themselves are spent, that the modern emphasis on &quot;mastery/logos&quot; has been displaced by something else. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the co-editors' adoption of what Martti Koskenniemi decries as the &quot;shopping mall approach to 'method,' the assumption that styles of legal writing are like brands of detergent that can be put on display ... to be picked up by the customer in accordance with his/her idiosyncratic preferences,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is itself postmodern, confirming J.M. Balkin's observation that &quot;the jurisprudence produced during the postmodern era will turn out to display &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*319]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  elements of postmodernity whether this is consciously desired or not.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Does this mean that PIL is merely a &quot;theory,&quot; devoid of application to particular problems, as opposed to a &quot;method&quot;? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not at all, as this Article will show by applying PIL to the problem posed in the symposium. But first, a story. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Run Lola Run begins with a phone call in an apartment in Berlin. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The TV is on. The call is from Lola's boyfriend, Manni, who has left a bag of money on the subway. His drug dealer boss expects Manni to deliver the bag in twenty minutes. Lola tells Manni to wait for her and promises that she'll think of something. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She runs out of the apartment and we see her running downstairs as a cartoon on the TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She runs through the city, bumps into a pedestrian, exchanges words with a passing bicyclist, is almost hit by a car, and dashes into the imposing Deutsche Transfer Bank, where she surprises her V.I.P. father with his mistress. She breathlessly begs him for help; he replies coldly that he is leaving her mother and that she is not even his daughter. Lola runs on, but she is too late. Manni, desperate, has already begun robbing the supermarket next to the telephone booth where he should have been waiting for her. He sees her and signals to her for help. She joins him, and is shot dead by the police a few minutes later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scene dissolves in surreal red light, and Lola and Manni are in bed, chatting and smoking. &quot;Manni, do you love me?&quot; she asks. Dismissing his assurances, she announces, &quot;I have a decision to make&quot; as the phone rings and she's off again. This time, however, she gives the pedestrian a wide berth. After her father refuses her request, she snatches a gun from a nearby security guard's holster and repeats her demand, holding the gun to her father's head. She gets the money and completes the gauntlet, arriving at the meeting place on time. Manni joyfully runs toward her and is run over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*320]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Again, Lola and Manni are in bed in the red light. &quot;What would you do if I died?&quot; he asks. &quot;You're not dead yet,&quot; she replies, as the telephone rings again. Lola encounters the same cast of characters, but this time she is lucky and she makes better choices. After her father refuses to give her money, she dashes into a casino and quickly wins what she needs. Leaving the phone booth, Manni performs a random act of kindness, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> returning a phone card to a blind woman who was in the booth before him. She points to a fleeing figure, who Manni sees is carrying the very bag of money he left on the subway. The movie ends with the lovers' happy reunion, both alive and rich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lola, obviously, is an international lawyer confronted with a crisis. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ways in which she deals with the people she runs into (or around, or over) are like the methods presented in the symposium. She must make a series of choices and react to an unpredictable series of choices made by others. Each choice becomes part of a story, and whose story it is becomes clear only in hindsight. Lola's choices affect the outcome, but they do not determine it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Article explains why Lola opts for PIL, which allows her to mix and meld other methods. It does so by appropriating the questions posed by the symposium, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> just as postmodernism appropriates the structures of modernism. First, it explains PIL's assumptions about the &quot;nature&quot; of international law, using lex lata (the &quot;law as it is&quot;) and lex ferenda (the &quot;law as it should be&quot;) as examples. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, it explains how PIL shifts our focus from the &quot;decision makers&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the public eye to those at the periphery, and how even a nameless pedestrian may shape the law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, this article explains why PIL is both inevitable and inevitably transient. Like Lola, the international lawyer dealing with &quot;accountability for violations of human dignity&quot; does not enter the story until something has &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*321]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  already gone terribly wrong. The international lawyer's chances of success, like Lola's, are not very good. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even if she does everything right, she may fail to achieve her objectives. International law is often irrelevant in such contexts or is sacrificed to other interests as a matter of political expediency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Lola in the final scenario, the international lawyer sometimes triumphs. Even if she does, however, her success is transient. At the end of the movie, Lola and Manni are alive and rich, but their happy ending - a successful drug deal - is part of other, less happy stories for other people. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIL questions the possibility of &quot;success&quot; in the context of &quot;accountability for violations of human dignity.&quot; We cannot rewind the tape; we cannot undo genocide or other atrocities. Is it nevertheless possible to restore order and meaning, or, in the words of the late Yale Law Professor Robert Cover, to affirm &quot;the imagined triumph of the normative universe&quot;? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is it possible to reconnect the victim - and perhaps even the perpetrator - to the larger community after &quot;world-destroying pain&quot;? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In two famous articles, Violence and the Word </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Nomos and Narrative, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cover shows how violence destroys meaning, isolating the victim and the perpetrator. It is through the &quot;word&quot; - the law and the narratives that drive the law </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - that we recreate meaning and possibilities for human &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*322]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  connection, thus &quot;projecting ... an imagined future upon reality.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But law itself is violent, Cover insists. That is, law must be grounded in political power willing and able to impose law through force. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task of Cover's martyr, to &quot;insist in the face of overwhelming force that if there is to be continuing life, it will not be on the terms of the tyrant's law,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is precisely the task addressed here. Cover's linkage of violence and the law, similarly, is precisely the linkage sought by international lawyers in this context, who often find themselves with plenty of words and enough law to fill multiple symposia, but without the muscle to impose it. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After words, in short, how can international lawyers assure the violence to back them up, in a postmodern world where this linkage cannot be assumed? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Never again!&quot; swore world leaders after World War II. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Drawing on the political will that had been pooled long enough to win the war, they were able to &quot;project ... an imagined future upon reality&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the form of an international legal order. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The words of the U.N. Charter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> along with the conventions which would be drafted to implement them, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would assure that genocide and crimes against &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*323]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  humanity never again took place. Several genocides later, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> however, the phrase is fatally tinged with irony. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the atrocities do not stop and they cannot be ignored. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Cover understood, the linkage of violence and the word, the recreation of nomos, is an ongoing project. Every new atrocity is a wake-up call, like Lola's ever-ringing phone, exhorting us to begin again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. PIL's Assumptions About the Nature of International Law<BR>&nbsp;<BR> While &quot;many doubt whether the term [postmodernism] can ever be dignified by conceptual coherence,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> three concepts widely viewed as characteristically postmodern are particularly pertinent here. First, as Jean Fran&lt;cedil c&gt;ois Lyotard explains, postmodernism is &quot;incredulity toward metanarratives.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, as critic Fredric Jameson points out, postmodernism is the &quot;cultural logic of late capitalism.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Third, as geographer David Harvey observes, &quot;The most startling fact about postmodernism ... [is] its total acceptance of ... ephemerality, fragmentation, discontinuity, and the chaotic.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These three distinct but related concepts, like Lola's three scenarios, embody PIL's assumptions about the nature of international law, as well as its multiple and contradictory possibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PIL's &quot;incredulity toward metanarratives&quot; leads it to question international law's reliance on the Enlightenment and to challenge Western hegemony. By situating international law within the &quot;cultural logic of late capitalism,&quot; PIL shows how international law shapes, and is shaped by, commodification and globalization. PIL's &quot;total acceptance of fragmentation&quot; highlights the fragmentation of international law in this context, shatters the underlying assumption of a universal standard, and suggests that to the extent international law blames violations of human dignity on the fragmentation of states, it takes a very statist perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*324]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Incredulity Toward Metanarratives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Dark Side of the Enlightenment.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Like international human rights law, postmodernism is often linked to the discovery of the death camps after World War II. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International law responded by drafting new laws that drew on the Enlightenment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Postmodernists such as Theodor Adorno, in contrast, questioned the role of the Enlightenment project itself in the Holocaust. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n61</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;final solution&quot; was not, after all, a barbarian rampage but an orderly, systematic &quot;scientific&quot; program of genocide - authoritarian, bureaucratic and perversely &quot;rational.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dark side of the Enlightenment was the reification of reason and the march towards a universal society. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was all too evident to Adorno in contemporary Stalinism and fascism. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As recent observers have noted, the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*325]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dangers are not limited to those particular totalizing cultures. The dark side of the Enlightenment can be seen, for example, in what Richard Falk describes as &quot;the dirty hands of our own governing process when it comes to such matters as ... the moral scandal of financing and promoting terrorism in Central America. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Enlightenment made &quot;man&quot; rather than God the center of the universe. But critics have charged that its purportedly universal, objective, rational subject is in fact a Western white man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and its promised Utopia the universalization of Western culture. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just as the Enlightenment sought to justify the power of Western culture, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and its devastating legacy of imperialism, post-Cold War international law seeks to justify the power of late capitalism, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which seems to be conspicuously less vigilant about &quot;violations of human dignity&quot; if cheap oil is at stake. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By challenging the Enlightenment metanarrative, PIL challenges Western hegemony, culturally and politically. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*326]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A Postmodernism of Resistance.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Such challenges are crucial in the context of individual accountability for violations of human dignity because they make us question our own assumptions on an ongoing basis. A key premise of the post-war international order </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was that human rights law would prevent such violations. PIL questions this premise, but does not necessarily reject it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While postmodernism may lead to &quot;the black hole of relativism,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> there is a &quot;postmodernism of 'resistance' as well as a postmodernism of 'reaction,'&quot; as Roy Boyne and Ali Rattansi observe. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, PIL accepts the premise that more human rights means fewer violations of human dignity but it does so contingently, always insisting that the premise be recognized as &quot;tentative, relational and unstable.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIL is grounded in what Katherine Bartlett has called &quot;standpoint epistemology,&quot; that is, critical assessment based on &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*327]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ongoing experience and critical reflection informed by that experience. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIL observes, for example, that human rights law has tacitly expanded to include neo-liberal trade rights. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, entrepreneurs have had the &quot;right&quot; to mine diamonds that fund civil wars in Africa. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interrogating the premises of international law reminds us of our own complicity and our own historical roles in the nightmare we come to judge. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It reminds us that the dark side may not be that which we can project onto the Other, the demonized war criminal, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but part of the human heart. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It exposes such projections as an exercise of power, and even a denial of the Other's humanity. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*328]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Limits of Theory.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Postmodern incredulity toward metanarratives also exposes the limits of theory. Philosopher Jonathan Glover expounds upon the theory underlying the linkage of human rights and the prevention of atrocities in a recent book focusing on Bosnia, Cambodia and Rwanda. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Glover argues that the crimes of genocide, mass murder, disappearance, and torture become possible when their victims are dehumanized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that dehumanization occurs through repeated and increasingly vicious &quot;violations of human dignity.&quot; Indeed, once a certain level of dehumanization is reached, these crimes become almost inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relatively petty violations of human dignity through which victims are dehumanized often include mockery and what Glover calls the &quot;cold joke.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These violations may be culturally specific, and what may be an intolerable insult in one culture may be shrugged off in another. As these violations become increasingly egregious, however, they increasingly fall within the prohibitions of well-established human rights law. The exhortations on Hutu-controlled radio to kill Tutsis, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for example, violated article 21 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (prohibiting hate speech and incitement to violence). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The camps into which Croat and Muslim civilians were herded, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> similarly, violated well-accepted international norms against arbitrary detention </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and international standards for the treatment of those in state custody. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*329]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In short, just as genocide - perhaps the ultimate violation of human rights </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - may be understood as the complete absence of any recognition of human dignity, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the opposite end of the spectrum, where human rights are fully assured, human dignity is given fullest recognition. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the modern metanarrative, international law discourages genocide, the complete denial of human dignity, on the one hand, by encouraging the fullest recognition of human dignity through human rights law, on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PIL recognizes the persuasive force of this argument, but also notes its limitations. Genocide may be more dependably deterred by violating human rights, by imposing curfews or even preventive detention, for example. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Genocide has occurred, moreover, without the apparent accretion of indignities, as in the Polish village of Jedwabne in which half the population murdered the other half. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Genocide may also be accompanied by the most meticulous attention to law, as the Nazis demonstrated and documented through their careful promulgation of regulations and orders governing treatment of the Jews. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, as Adeno Addis and others have noted, there are important aspects of human dignity which are generally ignored by human rights law, such as the collective rights of particular cultural groups. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Martha Minow soberly concludes, &quot;No one, of course, knows how to deter genocide or mass violence.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*330]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition, PIL exposes the underlying assumptions of homogeneity on which much of international legal theory is predicated. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIL recognizes that amnesty, for example, may well be useful, even necessary, in South Africa </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and a cynical mechanism to immunize violators in Peru. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact that most methods similarly recognize a range of amnesties, rather than a dichotomy between our amnesty - compassionate, pragmatic, and just - and their amnesty - cynical, self-serving, and unjust (a predictable dichotomy during the Cold War), simply indicates the extent to which &quot;we're all postmodernists now.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, by exposing the limits of theory, postmodern incredulity suggests a shift in focus from theory-building to storytelling. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stories give meaning to phrases like &quot;violations of human dignity&quot; and, as philosopher Richard Rorty explains, stories generate the &quot;sympathy&quot; crucial to a human rights culture: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*331]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR> A better sort of answer [than philosophy] is the sort of long, sad, sentimental story which begins, 'because this is what it is like to be in her situation - to be far from home, among strangers'... such stories, repeated and varied over the centuries, have induced us, the safe, rich, powerful people, to tolerate, and even to cherish, powerless people. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Most of the methods set out in the symposium contemplate such stories, but they focus on ferreting out the &quot;true story.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIL, in contrast, focuses on the multiplicity of stories. This does not mean accepting all stories as equally valid, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but it does mean recognizing multiple truths. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the recently published story of Konrad Latte, for example, we learn how he - along with about 2000 other Jews - survived World War II in Berlin. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As journalist Peter Schneider observes, &quot;For every Jew who survived in Berlin, at least 7 people must have intervened ... . We will never know how many Berliners had the decency and courage to save their Jewish co-citizens from the Nazis - 20,000, 30,000?&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, this story takes its place along with Daniel Goldhagen's stories of Hitler's Willing Executioners </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and innumerable stories of a fascist state so omnipresent, so relentless, that no German could possibly resist. The new story does not mean &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*332]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the others are untrue, but it subverts their claims of ubiquity and, in doing so, contributes to a more complex, nuanced understanding. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. &quot;The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In Fredric Jameson's oft-quoted phrase, &quot;postmodernism is the cultural logic of late capitalism.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This &quot;cultural logic&quot; has two related but distinct manifestations: commodification and globalization. Commodification refers to the transformation of something which is not commonly sold, traded or otherwise alienated - love, water, rituals of indigenous cultures - into something that is - mail-order brides, bottled water, $ 50 per head &quot;performances.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Globalization, as Boaventura de Sousa Santos explains, is &quot;the process by which a given local condition or entity succeeds in expanding its reach over the globe and, by doing so, develops the capacity to designate a rival social condition or entity as local.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By packaging culture, commodification makes globalization possible. By creating markets, globalization makes commodification profitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, along with dollars, Western culture </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is flowing freely around the world. Along with Coca Cola and Bruce Willis, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> western culture means &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*333]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  constitutionalism </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and free market ideology. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mass production of goods has been succeeded by the mass production of images </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and information, from the Golden Arches to MTV, proliferating in endless iterations around the world. Images of &quot;freedom&quot; and the rhetoric of &quot;rights&quot; are hot commodities, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> especially when they are linked, implicitly or explicitly, with images of American prosperity. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commodification and globalization are in large part responsible for the spread of the &quot;human rights idea.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They can be constructively exploited, as Amnesty International has effectively demonstrated with its celebrity extravaganzas. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While some modernists may wince at Rockin' for Human &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*334]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rights, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it raises consciousness and it raises money, with which Amnesty can continue to ratchet its public visibility in a series of high profile advertisements. Indeed, this has been understood since the beginning of the human rights </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which emerged not from the Holocaust but from mass-marketed stories of the Holocaust, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the carefully-edited Diary of Anne Frank, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elie Weisel's Night, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the grim lyricism of The Sorrow and the Pity. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commodification contributes to respect for human dignity, it can be &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*335]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  argued, through high-grossing movies like Schindler's List, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and tourist attractions like the Holocaust Museum. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the commodification of justice detracts from its legitimacy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, ironically, commodification cheapens justice, even if it costs billions. As commentator Charles Krauthammer notes, for example, Milosevic lost the election because the &quot;U.S. poured millions of dollars into the democratic opposition&quot;; he was arrested after &quot;the U.S. Congress had stipulated that unless Serbia showed cooperation ... the U.S. would withhold $ 50 million in reconstruction aid&quot;; and he was surrendered on the eve of the donors' conference on whether to grant aid. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Krauthammer says, &quot;Money talks... . These are the forces that brought Milosevic to justice.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice may be blind, but as Manni realizes in the last scenario (when the blind woman points to the fleeing figure with his bag of cash), </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it pays to keep an eye on the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the cultural logic of late capitalism takes on a life of its own, not subject to anyone's control. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n136</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The impact of an image, technologically enhanced, simultaneously available everywhere, whether &quot;true&quot; or not, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n137</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*336]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  drives the law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n138</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rhetoric, especially powerful visual images, generates the political will to link violence and the word. This may result in punishment for those who violate human dignity, as the footage of the death camps did at Nuremberg. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n139</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it may also make such violations possible. Thus, the image of the American soldier being dragged along the street in Somalia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n140</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appearing on millions of screens throughout the country, discouraged intervention in Rwanda. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n141</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As in Lola, only in hindsight does any result seem inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Fragmentation<BR>&nbsp;<BR> According to David Harvey:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> The most startling fact about postmodernism [is] its total acceptance of the ephemerality, fragmentation, discontinuity, and the chaotic ... . But postmodernism responds to that fact in a very particular way. It does not try to transcend it, counteract it, or even to define the &quot;eternal and immutable&quot; elements that might lie within it. Postmodernism swims, even wallows, in the fragmentary and the chaotic currents of change as if that is all there is. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n142</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> PIL's &quot;total acceptance of ... fragmentation&quot; illuminates the instant context in three specific ways. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n143</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, it focuses us on the fragmentation of the law, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*337]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  addressing the issue of accountability for violations of human dignity, particularly the humanitarian/human rights law divide. Because of this fragmentation, which is exacerbated by the multiple bodies interpreting and applying the law, lex lata (&quot;the law as it is&quot;) is problematic in this context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Second, PIL's acceptance of fragmentation encourages a closer look at lex ferenda, or &quot;what the law should be,&quot; particularly the underlying assumption of a universal standard. Even if there is a universal hunger for nomos, the project of imagining it is necessarily culture-specific. The law should be fragmented, accordingly, but coherent within a particular context. Finally, PIL's acceptance of fragmentation highlights the fragmentation of states themselves, in which some argue the problem is grounded. That is, the collapse of the nation state leads to violations of human dignity because there is no effective police authority to prevent them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Lex Lata-&quot;The Law As It Is&quot;.L ex Lata-'The Law As It Is'.Lex Lata-'The Law As It Is'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a. The Fragmentation of International Law in General<BR>&nbsp;<BR> As Pierre Schlag and others have pointed out, the law is already postmodern. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n144</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the features associated with postmodernism, &quot;the increasing fragmentation and heterogeneity of culture, the weakening of traditional historical narratives, the devolution of the modernist syntheses, the increasing speed, proliferation and succession of forms of life, the new modes of critical practice and techniques - are all already present in the law.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n145</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These features are even more &quot;present&quot; in international law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n146</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike domestic law, international law remains fragmentary: there is no Supreme Court to reconcile warring districts, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n147</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> no legislature to fill in doctrinal gaps. Indeed, international &quot;law-making&quot; is often so contentious that no law is made at all; in many areas there are more gaps than law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n148</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*338]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  International law is unapologetically </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n149</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;discontinuous&quot;; the decisions of the International Court of Justice have no precedential value, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n150</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and those of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n151</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n152</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are similarly ad hoc. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n153</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Treaty law applies only to the specific subject the particular treaty addresses and is binding only on the parties to the treaty. While customary international law (&quot;CIL&quot;) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n154</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> applies more broadly, states may persistently dissent from CIL and exempt themselves from its coverage. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n155</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the broad general principals that comprise CIL, moreover, such as the duty to avoid harm to neighboring states, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n156</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prove difficult to apply in specific cases. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n157</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b. The Fragmentation of IHL/Human Rights Law in Particular<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The law governing individual accountability for violations of human dignity in internal wars is so fragmentary that it is incoherent. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n158</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*339]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  symposium demonstrates, the sharpest legal minds in international law are unable to agree on what the law is, let alone its meaning, impact, or application. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n159</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, there are two distinct bodies of international law purporting to apply here, international humanitarian law (&quot;IHL&quot;) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n160</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and international human rights law. Neither is particularly clear in this context. Notwithstanding lex specialis; the general rule that the more specific law will apply, the more specific IHL is riddled with exceptions in the context of internal armed conflict. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n161</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As set out in the four Geneva Conventions, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n162</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for example, only common Article 3 applies to internal armed conflicts. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n163</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Common Article 3 only applies, moreover, if the armed conflict occurs &quot;in the territory of one of the high contracting parties.&quot; In addition, it only applies to &quot;persons taking no active part in the hostilities,&quot; thus eliminating the prisoner of war regime applicable in international armed conflicts. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n164</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IHL is further muddled because &quot;conflict not of an international character&quot; is nowhere defined. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n165</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*340]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Optional Protocol II, specifically focused on non-international conflicts (whatever they are), is further limited to conflicts among &quot;organized armed groups, which, under responsible command, exercise such control over part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement this Protocol.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n166</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Article 1.2, however, explicitly exempts &quot;situations of internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence and other acts of this similar nature, as not being armed conflicts.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n167</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Theodor Meron notes, as long as there is a state, it will characterize an armed conflict within its borders as a &quot;disturbance.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n168</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While conventional human rights law </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n169</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not explicitly limited to peacetime, during conflict it is subject to derogation under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n170</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n171</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Specified rights, e.g., the right to life or freedom from arbitrary detention, are nonderogable, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n172</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but even these may be balanced against the humanitarian law defense of &quot;military necessity.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n173</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While peremptory norms, i.e., jus cogens norms, from which no derogation is permitted, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n174</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remain in effect, reliance on other CIL during conflict is problematic. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n175</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances, if any, under which individuals may be held accountable is similarly a matter of continuing controversy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n176</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> States may be &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*341]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  liable under the Geneva Conventions, the human rights treaties, or CIL, and there is some precedent for individual civil liability in connection with jus cogens violations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n177</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But individual criminal liability is a matter of domestic law </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n178</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the statutes of the ad hoc tribunals. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n179</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the Nuremberg Tribunal established liability for crimes against humanity, it expressly limited liability to those involving interstate aggression. Thus, Nuremberg provides no authority for imposing liability in the context of internal armed conflict. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n180</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, growing numbers of international </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n181</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as well as national tribunals </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n182</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> address all of these issues, and the relations among them are unsettled. The ICTY </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n183</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and ICTR </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n184</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interpret both bodies of law as well as their own statutes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n185</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several states have asserted universal jurisdiction over &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*342]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jus cogens violations </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n186</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as well as other violations of human rights law. The proliferating truth commissions - part tribunal, part public confessional - do not always attempt to sort out what the law is. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n187</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applicable law, in short, is relatively recent, unsettled, and shows few signs of stabilizing. In fact, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 1998, which will come into force in July 2002, may make international criminal law even more ambiguous. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n188</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While many consider the provisions of the ICC Statute to state existing customary law, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n189</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this is difficult to reconcile with several major states' refusal to ratify it, including the United States, China, and Russia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n190</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reflecting a lack of consensus on central issues. The United States refuses to ratify the ICC, for example, in part because of concerns about exposing U.S. nationals, particularly those in the military, to criminal prosecution before tribunals hostile to the United &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*343]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  States. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n191</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the United States agreed that the U.S. military would be subject to such prosecution under CIL, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n192</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> however, its opposition would be academic. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n193</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it may be argued that the elements of a crime should be distinguished from jurisdiction over the alleged perpetrator, the relationship between the violation of the law and a state's willingness to punish that violation is all too clear in this context. As Lord Browne-Wilkinson opined in the Pinochet case:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> [Before the coming into force of the Torture Convention] ... there was no international tribunal to punish torture and no general jurisdiction to permit or require its punishment in domestic courts. Not until there was some form of universal jurisdiction for the punishment of the crime of torture could it really be talked about as a fully constituted international crime. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n194</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> This doctrinal parsing reflects (and sustains) a fatal disconnect, a gap, between violence and the word. The law is as variable as the political will to impose it. Lex lata, accordingly, remains fragmentary and discontinuous. Recognizing the absence of any firm legal ground, international lawyers answer strategically when asked, &quot;What is the law?&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n195</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They hope that a few key convictions, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n196</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in conjunction with the willingness of at least some national courts to assert jurisdiction </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n197</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the revelations of the truth commissions, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n198</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will help some of the victims, their families, and &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*344]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  communities come to terms with what has happened to them. Perhaps there will be enough violence to deter some violations of human dignity, and to leave some perpetrators with a lifelong apprehension of retribution, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n199</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> however uncertain in form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Lex Ferenda - The Fragmentation of the &quot;Law As It Should Be&quot;.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Lex Ferenda poses a very modern question: What should the law be? The question assumes an answer, that there is some law that will effectively prevent, deter or punish violations of human dignity. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n200</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIL does not preclude the question posed by lex ferenda, but it questions the modern premise, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n201</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and again insists on the contingency of any answer. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n202</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the premise is wrong, however, the question may still be worth asking. This is the demand of Cover's martyrs, &quot;insisting on the law to which they are committed&quot;; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n203</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that is, the restoration of nomos, a normative universe. It is important to note that the project here is not the creation of nomos, requiring the strong forces which &quot;create the normative worlds in which law is predominantly a system of meaning rather than an imposition of force.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n204</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather, we are concerned with its restoration, requiring the &quot;weak forces&quot; which Cover identifies with liberalism. As he explains,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> The universalist virtues that we have come to identify with modern liberalism ... are essentially system-maintaining &quot;weak&quot; forces. They are virtues that are justified by the need to ensure the coexistence of worlds of strong normative meaning. The systems of strong normative life that they maintain are the products of &quot;strong&quot; forces: culture-specific designs of particularist meaning. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n205</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Cover's weak, system-maintaining forces are similarly the virtues of international law. They are justified, as they are in liberalism, by &quot;the need to ensure the coexistence of worlds of strong normative meaning.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n206</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIL contemplates the restoration of nomos within the framework of international law. PIL will neither support nor allow a nomos grounded in caste </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n207</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*345]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  women's subordination, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n208</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for example. But PIL, unlike liberalism and modern international law, recognizes that international law also incorporates &quot;strong forces [or] culture-specific designs of particularist meaning.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n209</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIL recognizes that international law is not &quot;neutral,&quot; but a culture unto itself. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n210</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International lawyers are always concerned with at least two &quot;cultures,&quot; the national and the international, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n211</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and often even more where violations of human dignity are alleged. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n212</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From a PIL perspective, international law must resonate within and across the borders of these cultures. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n213</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lex ferenda is necessarily fragmented because its objective is to restore an inevitably fragmented normative universe. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n214</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even if the law cannot effectively address violations of human dignity, it may still be important to try - for a multiplicity of reasons, reflecting the range of &quot;culture-specific designs of particularist meaning&quot; whose coexistence it seeks to assure. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n215</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Minow, for example, notes the need to avoid complicity. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n216</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lawrence Weschler reports the consensus of atrocity scholars that public &quot;acknowledgment&quot; is &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*346]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  psychologically crucial for most, if not all, victims. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n217</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked why he participated in a UN fact-finding mission to Rwanda, William Schabas responded simply: &quot;It seemed important to let the Rwandans know that [Westerners] were interested in their stories.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n218</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Schabas left it to those who came forward to decide why it was important for them to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a PIL perspective, lex ferenda should be particularly open to challenge from the bottom, from those who have been subordinated and claim that the law perpetuates that subordination, but considerably more skeptical regarding challenges from above. Recognizing that the omission of rape as a war crime perpetuates the subordination of women, for example, is a good reason </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n219</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for expanding the law to include rape as a war crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PIL's acceptance of the fragmentation of the normative universe multiplies such challenges. The conviction for war crimes of four Rwandans by a Belgian court in June, 2001, for example, was both an effective exercise of universal jurisdiction and a painful reminder of imperialism. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n220</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The normative universe is fragmented here into that of the Tutsi victims in 1994 and that of the larger Rwandan population (including the Hutus) throughout its colonial history. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n221</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lex ferenda, accordingly, should recognize the challenges of both subordinated groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a PIL perspective, the Belgian trial both vindicated international law by punishing the 1994 violations of human dignity, and simultaneously recalled international law's role in colonialism, which institutionalized the violations of human dignity in which the 1994 violations were arguably grounded. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n222</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lex ferenda could address this dilemma in several different ways. It could indicate a preference, for example, for trials before international tribunals over trials before the courts of former colonial powers. But there may well be cases where such courts should assume the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*347]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  responsibility and the expense of such prosecutions precisely because of their historical complicity. The argument that international law is an imposition of Western will </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n223</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> neither precludes application of that law nor requires the refutation, or denial, of its characterization as another iteration of &quot;victor's justice.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n224</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather, the argument demands a more complex understanding of international law. Lex ferenda should incorporate that understanding, but how it does so in a particular case may best be left open. Like Lola, international lawyers sometimes must rely on inspiration. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n225</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Fragmentation of States.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The fragmentation of states is often viewed as the underlying cause of the &quot;internal conflicts&quot; in which violations of human dignity occur with grim regularity. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n226</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fragmentation of states may allow violations of human dignity, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n227</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or may result from them. It is unclear who &quot;civilians&quot; are or who constitutes a &quot;stable and permanent group.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n228</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is blamed not on international law, but on international politics. The conventional story is that the superpowers supported strong-arm regimes that were able to hold diverse states together. With the fall of the Soviet Union and the withdrawal of the U.S., &quot;the center does not hold, things fall apart,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n229</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from Tito's Yugoslavia to Mobutu's Zaire. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n230</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*348]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From a PIL perspective, however, this is a very statist view, which is not surprising since the nation state remains the major player in the modern story. The particular agendas of particular nation states are complicated, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n231</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but none happily relinquish sovereign prerogatives. While rumors of the demise of the sovereign state may be premature, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n232</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proliferation of political forms is clear, from increased fragmentation on the one hand, such as the continuing breakdown of the already fragmented former Yugoslavia, to growing numbers of regional arrangements on the other, such as the ongoing consolidation of authority by the European Union, North American Free Trade Agreement, and Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The question thus becomes whether there are legal institutions capable of ensuring the accountability of these new political institutions. As described above, such institutions are emerging rapidly in the international law context. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n233</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, national courts are redefining their roles, effectively functioning as transnational legal institutions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n234</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, while fragmented states may be dangerous places, few are in the same league for sheer murderousness as the Soviet Gulag. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n235</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Violations of human dignity may well be easier to conceal in a unified state, especially in a state less concerned with avoiding such violations than with hiding them. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n236</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the violations of human dignity in the strong-arm regimes before the end of the Cold War are now coming to light. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n237</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While many warn about the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*349]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  obvious risks of rogue states with nuclear weapons, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n238</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the United States remains the only country that has actually attacked another state with such weapons. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n239</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no question that fragmented states create many problems - including some life-threatening problems - for their populations. But it is unclear whether increased &quot;violations of human dignity&quot; are among them, especially if we are only considering violations committed &quot;under a commander in charge&quot; as required by Protocol II, rather than violations in general. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n240</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. Whose Actions Matter?<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The Symposium asked, &quot;Who are the decision makers? ... . In other words, whose actions matter in each method's universe?&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n241</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIL challenges the assumptions in these questions by suggesting that the &quot;decision makers&quot; are not necessarily the ones &quot;whose actions matter.&quot; PIL focuses not on those at the center, but on those at the margins, at the periphery. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n242</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, those &quot;whose actions matter&quot; are not necessarily the judges and the statesmen (sic) in the public eye, but those who are barely visible at the edges. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n243</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*350]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  includes the victims, but it may also include powerful players who seek the relative privacy of the margins precisely for the purpose of avoiding accountability. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n244</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those whose actions matter may also include those who are invisible, like the filmmaker, or those whose significance only becomes clear in hindsight. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n245</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Run Lola Run, a few of the people Lola runs into, peripheral to the main story, are followed by fast montages showing their futures, which change in each version. The irritated pedestrian, for example, is followed by a series of photos showing her holding up a winning lottery ticket, hugging a fat happy man, and with the same man on a boat, beaming. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n246</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The postmodern recognition that everyone has a story, and that every story has a narrator, shifts the focus from the positivists' analyses of functional processes and even the &quot;thick&quot; descriptions of the New Haven School, to serendipity (who has a friend in the media </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n247</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or the arts? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n248</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whose story appeals to those in power?) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n249</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and to transient players, like the &quot;teenagers who brought Milosevic down.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n250</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*351]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lola also reminds us that sometimes those in charge remain behind the scenes, like the filmmaker himself, the hidden subject. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n251</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As in a movie, moreover, the idea of &quot;accountability for violations of human dignity&quot; depends on an audience. A trial, or truth commission, is in fact a performance, a very public form of &quot;justice.&quot; Who scripts this performance and who plays the crucial roles? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n252</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Who are they trying to mobilize, placate, or warn? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n253</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Who's at Risk?<BR>&nbsp;<BR> This ever-changing cast must begin with the actual victims (if any survive), those whose human dignity has in fact been violated.

Who is left out, ignored by the law? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n254</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Violations of women's human rights, such as rape, for example, were historically neither violations of humanitarian law nor of human rights law, because the state was not the perpetrator. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n255</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stories of Bosnian women and girls repeatedly raped and often impregnated horrified feminists and women's groups. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n256</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They brought the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*352]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rapes to media and government attention through a variety of stratagems. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n257</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michigan law professor Catherine MacKinnon, for example, called the media and delivered moving sound bites while also suing in U.S. district court. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n258</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Feminist groups throughout Europe lobbied their governments and the ICTY. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n259</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was a laborious, multipronged effort, raising the consciousness of participants at multiple levels. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n260</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The victims' stories, strategically publicized and disseminated, resulted in provisions recognizing rape as a war crime in the statutes of the ICTY </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n261</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the ICC, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n262</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as well as the ICTR. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n263</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feminists have criticized these provisions because they characterize rape as a crime against &quot;dignity,&quot; reflecting the notion of rape as a crime against the honor of the woman's husband and community, rather than as a violation of the woman's rights. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n264</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Charlesworth notes, furthermore, their inclusion may have little impact on deeply gendered social structures. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n265</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, the consequences for the perpetrators have been negligible. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n266</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, the stories of a group of seemingly powerless victims, far removed from the decision makers, helped shape the law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n267</SUP></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Who's in Charge?<BR>&nbsp;<BR> PIL is less interested in nuanced and sophisticated descriptions of legal doctrine than in the acts of powerful players at the margins, where &quot;human dignity&quot; is not discussed. The forced return of Haitian refugees to a country where they faced almost certain persecution and death, for example, was not considered a &quot;violation of human dignity.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n268</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As an outraged international human rights community pointed out, their return clearly violated the right of non-return, or non-refoulement, i.e., the rights of refugees everywhere to not be sent back to the hell they have fled. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n269</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet those who made the decision to return the Haitians were able to remain at the periphery, largely insulated from legal repercussions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n270</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less dramatically, because there was no action comparable to the forced return, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n271</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but perhaps more disturbing, because there was no violation of international law, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n272</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the U.S. refusal to support sending U.N. troops to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*354]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rwanda to prevent the ensuing genocide carried no legal liability. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n273</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In both cases, powerful leaders were able to avoid the charge of violating &quot;human dignity&quot; by what Glover calls &quot;a passive response.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n274</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the appearance of power is often desirable, its invisibility may be even more so. Thus, some of the major players remain behind the scenes, like film makers, directing the action, calling the shots, but invisible and unaccountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Who Cares?<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In addition to the players, i.e., those at risk and those in charge, PIL recognizes that there is always a larger audience to be addressed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n275</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This audience is necessarily fragmented, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n276</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> consisting most immediately of a judge, jury, or tribunal, but also of politicians, their constituencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n277</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, crucially, the media and media consumers, all of whom function on national and international levels. In addition, these &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*355]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  international audiences operate within the globalized and commodified contexts of CNN, the internet, and satellite media. These audiences are increasingly sophisticated, skeptical as to any metanarrative, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n278</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alert to spin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law matters, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n279</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but the question &quot;Who is accountable?&quot; quickly becomes politicized. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n280</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Who can be blamed? Who can profit from prosecuting? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n281</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> War crimes, of course, have always been politicized. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n282</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is precisely the impression that &quot;objective&quot; and consistent international law is intended to overcome. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n283</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is complicated by the presence of many players with conflicting objectives. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n284</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The surviving victims or their families may seek to identify the responsible individuals, to punish and to deter. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n285</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Or they may simply seek official, formal acknowledgment of the crimes committed against them. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n286</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perpetrators may seek amnesty or forgiveness. Victims and perpetrators may overlap. The state may seek to impose liability on individuals in order to exonerate a people. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n287</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where there would be no state left if all violators were imprisoned, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n288</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in contrast, it may instead push for &quot;truth and reconciliation.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n289</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*356]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  National authorities may well be in the best position to weigh these alternatives, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n290</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inviting popular input as authorities did in South Africa. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n291</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But national authorities are also likely to have the most at stake. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n292</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Accountability&quot; may become a mechanism for purging the opposition, obtaining foreign aid, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n293</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and securing their own authority. &quot;Exoneration&quot; may enable a regime to assure the loyalty of powerful groups, or even to avert a coup. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n294</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is further complicated, paradoxically, by the need to provide a broader, global audience </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n295</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with an unambiguous spectacle, a moral drama. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n296</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lawyers not only need to prevail on the legal merits, but need to generate, or sustain, the political will to assure the violence that Cover explains is necessary to enforce the law. This requires publicity and skillful handling of the media. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n297</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Drafting an indictment for Milosevic, for example, was only a preliminary step. It is doubtful that he would have been arrested without relentless marketing. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n298</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*357]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like a filmmaker, an international lawyer needs to take a pro-active stance with respect to the question, &quot;Who cares?&quot; The question becomes a question of marketing: &quot;Who needs to care&quot; to generate the requisite political will </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n299</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and how can this audience be made to care? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n300</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IV. The Inevitability of PIL and Its Transience<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The symposium's final question - &quot;Why is [your method] a better method than the others?&quot; - is carefully posed in the alternative: &quot;Why is your method better at tackling some subject areas than others?&quot; The co-chairs recognize the necessary contingency of any thoughtful response. From a PIL perspective, however, even what is &quot;better&quot; at tackling some subject areas remains a contingent determination. What is &quot;better&quot; for whom? Even narrowing the question to &quot;which is better to assure accountability for particular kinds of violations?&quot; gives rise to at least seven plausible answers, as set forth in the symposium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Precisely because there are an indefinite number of plausible answers, PIL is inevitable as long as international law is functioning within the &quot;cultural logic of late capitalism.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n301</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever one's method of choice, at some point its limitations, or the obvious advantages of some other method, will induce a switch. While every method assumes a world view, PIL moves among them like a cable subscriber with a remote control. At the same time, however, PIL is inevitably transient, always changing form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. PIL's Inevitability<BR>&nbsp;<BR> While the International Legal Process school provides a rational approach to decisionmaking, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n302</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and law and economics offers tools of measurement, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n303</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIL offers ambiguity. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n304</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the New Haven school provides a way to track consensus, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n305</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIL offers marginality. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n306</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*358]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  feminist theory offers a normative polestar, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n307</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIL offers ambivalence. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n308</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While critical theory provides tools to rigorously deconstruct international law, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n309</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIL goes to the movies. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n310</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Who needs it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most international lawyers, sooner or later, seek alternatives to whatever method(s) they employ. None of the methods in the symposium claims to be timeless, eternal, or &quot;true,&quot; and no one cares. PIL is implicit in the structure of the symposium itself, which recognizes that no method trumps; none can possibly exclude all the others or those still to come. As even the positivists Simma and Paulus concede, &quot;of course, the time when the claim of positive science to objective knowledge remained largely unchallenged is over, and there is no way back to yesterday's certainties behind the insights of critical theory, be it late - or postmodern.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n311</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIL is the portal to all that lies beyond the various &quot;modernisms&quot; set out in the symposium. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n312</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the methods in the symposium, PIL explicitly situates analysis in the spatial and historical context of globalization. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n313</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;spatial context of globalization&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n314</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> includes not only geography (Where are these violations occurring? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n315</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How close to Europe? How far from any U.N. &quot;peacekeepers?&quot;) but technology </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n316</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Is the violation of &quot;human dignity&quot; on CNN? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n317</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Or is it &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*359]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  only available through an obscure listserve?). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n318</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;historical context of globalization&quot; refers not only to the post-Cold War triumph of &quot;free market democracy,&quot; but also to the transposition of Cold War conflicts to other contexts. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n319</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Modern&quot; analyses are more constrained. They may take globalization into account, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n320</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but they do so hegemonically, subsuming it to their own metanarratives. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n321</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conceptual frameworks of modernity can no more represent globalization than texts can represent the polymorphous information streaming through the internet. PIL, in contrast, plays with the frameworks of modernity, recognizing them as human inventions, always subject to reinvention. This may lead to the &quot;black hole of relativism,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n322</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but it can also lead to the transformative politics </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n323</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of critical theories </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n324</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> such as feminism, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n325</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> critical legal studies, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n326</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> critical race theory, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n327</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and postcolonialism. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n328</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*360]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Professors Balkin and Schlag note, all law produced during the postmodern era will show signs of postmodernism. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n329</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PIL is inevitable as a method, a strategic choice, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n330</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> because PIL offers the fullest access to the methods set out in the symposium </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n331</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, at the same time, the fullest array of tools with which to unpack the metanarratives of which these methods are a part. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n332</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like Lola, PIL asks: Whose story is it? Who is appropriating it for what purpose? Who will get the money at the end? Who will survive?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PIL is the idiolect of our time. We need only note the fragmentation and discontinuity of our own discourse, and our apparently happy acceptance of that fragmentation, as evidenced by the symposium itself. Incredulity toward metanarratives is apparent in the U.S. resistance to the ICC (and its preference &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*361]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for ad hoc tribunals). It is equally apparent in the widespread criticism of that resistance, which scoffs at the United States' invocation of its major metanarrative, the Constitution, as disingenuous if not hypocritical. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n333</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even as we dismiss Lola's plot and gimmicky premise, its focus on money and its reliance on slick camera work, we might note the commodification of our own discipline as we advertise </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n334</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and produce videos. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n335</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The American Society of International Law has hired its own media specialist. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n336</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nuremberg was made into a mini-series last summer. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n337</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. PIL's Inevitable Transience<BR>&nbsp;<BR> PIL is inevitably transient because, like postmodernism in general, it &quot;swims, even wallows, in the fragmentary and the chaotic currents of change as if that is all there is.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n338</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no eternal and universal &quot;justice&quot; to be meted out; there are only victims, alleged war criminals, witnesses, judges and lawyers together trying to &quot;project ... an imagined future,&quot; a normative universe, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n339</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> grounded not in some glorious abstraction, but in painstakingly constructed, albeit flexible and contingent, norms of human dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PIL precludes another Nuremberg. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n340</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The circumstances of Milosevic's surrender, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n341</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as well speculations as to his sanity, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n342</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have already assured that his trial in the Hague will be very different. Whatever the outcome, moreover, no one will be hung since Europe has rejected the death penalty. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n343</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the international community may &quot;never again&quot; experience the moral certainty of Nuremberg is not necessarily bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*362]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The question remains, however, whether there is enough certainty to inspire and legitimate the violence of the law, to draw states together to impose their collective will. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n344</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the question that Lola, and all international lawyers, must grapple with in the surreal red light between nightmare and action, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n345</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and it is a question inevitably answered piecemeal, on the run, as we draw on experience and count on luck, hoping to prevent another death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">V. Conclusion<BR>&nbsp;<BR> What saves Lola from mere cleverness is that she is not running for money; she is running for love, to save Manni's life, to affirm and sustain her connection with another human being. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n346</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like saving Manni, the issue of accountability for violations of human dignity is ultimately one of human connection. The international law project is to reconnect the victims, and sometimes even the perpetrators, to the community, and, in doing so, to reestablish that community and a normative universe in which it can thrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PIL reminds us that identities of &quot;violator&quot; and &quot;victim&quot; may be problematic, that the notion of some nomos embracing them both may be even more so, and that in a postmodern world, all such constructions are inevitably unstable and tentative. This does not, of course, preclude the effort. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n347</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the contrary, it heightens the importance of the work, and the sense of urgency and purposefulness of those who undertake it. Run Lola run.</SPAN></P>

PIL's relationship to modernism is one of the ways in which it is distinguishable from the &quot;New Approaches to International Law&quot; (NAIL), which David Kennedy describes as &quot;a self-conscious effort to build a collective intellectual project of disciplinary criticism and renewal [which the author calls] &quot;new approaches' to suggest a big tent, interested in the widest range of innovative energy without predetermining where it would lead.&quot; David Kennedy, When Renewal Repeats: Thinking Against the Box, 32 N.Y.U. J. Int'l L. &amp; Pol. 335, 489 (2000). PIL is more likely to define itself in terms of its relationship to modernism; unlike NAIL, it puts &quot;new&quot; in inverted quotes. Another distinction between NAIL and PIL is in their relationship to &quot;critical theories.&quot; See infra Section IV.A., PIL's Inevitability. But many elements of the NAIL project resonate with postmodernism, such as their shared attention to the &quot;will to power,&quot; their &quot;embrace of the dark side,&quot; their skepticism, their resistance to &quot;progress,&quot; and their preference for ambivalence.

Among recent international incidents involving the use of force, the NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (&quot;F.R.Y. ... In order to evaluate the attack, one may consider the following three possibilities: (1) that the RTS was used for civilian broadcasting, including propaganda, which often did not accurately reflect objective facts but which in no way could be characterized as incitement to international criminal activity, for example, genocide; (2) that the RTS' broadcasts could be characterized as incitement to genocide; or (3) that the RTS functioned as in situation (1) and, in addition, had a military function. ...  The OTP Report is equivocal on this point by concluding that the legality of the attack on the RTS was &quot;debatable&quot; if the justification was that the target was a propaganda organ. ... Assuming that the RTS was a legitimate military target, the subsequent question must concern whether the number of casualties - sixteen civilian Serbs - was proportional to the military advantage gained by destroying the TV station. ... &quot; Additionally, both the Inter-American and the European human rights regimes have recently examined cases that included aspects of armed conflict and international humanitarian law. ... The important question is not whether the convoy constituted a military target, but rather, whether NATO took sufficient precautions in order to determine and verify that the target was legitimate. ... &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INTRODUCTION<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The age-old maxim, inter arma silent leges (&quot;in times of war, the laws are silent&quot;) often applies to situations in which states perceive their vital interests to be involved, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and has found a contemporary expression in Dean Acheson's famous utterance that &quot;the survival &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*766]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of states is not a matter of law.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite this acknowledgement, states traditionally have not been able to escape community judgment, especially in a variety of non-judicial fora, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when using force for self-defense or national survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the twenty-first century, the legal merits of a state's decision to use force (jus ad bellum) and the actual implementation of such a decision (jus in bello) are likely to be of concern to &quot;third parties&quot; other than the &quot;persuasive,&quot; but rather ineffectual college of international lawyers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, judicial bodies are increasingly likely to scrutinize decisions to resort to force and other forms of hostilities. Among recent international incidents involving the use of force, the NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (&quot;F.R.Y.&quot;), Operation Allied Force (&quot;OAF&quot;), has been and continues to be subject to scrutiny in a variety of international fora, including international courts. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*767]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NATO's OAF campaign against the F.R.Y. began on March 24, 1999 and was suspended on June 10, 1999. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During this period, NATO planes made approximately 38,000 sorties, of which around one-third were actual attack missions, and delivered 23,614 pieces, totaling around 6,000 tons of munitions. Approximately thirty-five percent of these were Precision Guided Munitions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although other figures have been raised, there appears to be general agreement that approximately five hundred Yugoslav civilians were killed during the seventy-eight day campaign. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of these, two-thirds were killed in &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*768]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  only twelve incidents. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several organizations and international bodies have severely criticized NATO's bombing campaign. Most prominently, at least among judicial investigations, is the case at the International Court of Justice (&quot;I.C.J.&quot;), assessing the legality of OAF. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 29, 1999, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*769]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the F.R.Y. instituted proceedings before the I.C.J. against ten NATO member states, accusing them of violating the international legal obligation not to use force against another state. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The F.R.Y. also filed a request for interim measures of protection, asking the Court to order a halt to the bombing. On June 2, 1999, the Court refused to issue such an order because it found that it lacked prima facie jurisdiction in eight of the cases. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With regard to two of the cases, against Spain and the United States, the Court held that it manifestly lacked jurisdiction, and these two cases were removed from the list. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The remaining eight states have subsequently presented their arguments concerning the jurisdictional issue to the Court. The F.R.Y. was originally given until April 5, 2001 to respond, but this deadline has since been extended until April 5, 2002. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*770]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a separate case, several family members of individuals killed during NATO's attack on the Serbian television station (&quot;RTS&quot;) filed a separate claim entitled Bankovic and Others v. The Contracting States, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the European Court of Human Rights (&quot;ECHR&quot;) in Strasbourg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to many other judicial initiatives, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> there were attempts to investigate and prosecute NATO leaders and personnel at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (&quot;ICTY&quot;). The Office of the Prosecution (&quot;OTP&quot;) at the ICTY received several requests to investigate NATO conduct during Operation Allied Force. Among these, was a request sent to Chief Prosecutor, Louise Arbour, from Professor Michael Mandel of Osgoode Hall Law School, on behalf of a number of international lawyers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On May 14, 1999, the chief prosecutor decided to establish &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*771]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a Committee to evaluate the accusations against NATO and to advise her of the need for a formal investigation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Committee delivered its report at the end of May 2000. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 2, 2000, Carla del Ponte, Arbour's successor, informed the U.N. Security Council that she intended to follow the recommendations in the Report to not initiate a formal investigation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OTP subsequently made its report public (&quot;OTP Report&quot;). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OTP Report deals with jus in bello questions, such as damage to the environment in the F.R.Y., the use of depleted uranium and cluster bombs, and the question of target selection. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the OTP Report subjects five individual attacks to specific evaluation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two prominent non-governmental organizations (&quot;NGOs&quot;), Amnesty International </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Human Rights Watch, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also issued &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*772]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  substantial reports dealing with the conduct of OAF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although comparable in subject matter, the OTP Report can reasonably be identified as the most &quot;important&quot; of the three. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The possible conclusions of the OTP Report would have had further reaching consequences for the investigated states, the ICTY, international humanitarian law, and international criminal law. Viewing the mandates of the three organizations can briefly highlight the qualitative difference, not in legal wisdom but in potential reach and influence. Human Rights Watch's mandate is to investigate and expose human rights violations and hold abusers accountable. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International works broadly to promote adherence to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other internationally recognized human rights instruments. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their most formidable &quot;weapons&quot; are information campaigns. Juxtaposed to these mandates, the ICTY has the authority to prosecute individuals who have committed serious violations of international humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> States are obligated to cooperate with the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*773]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ICTY in connection with the investigations and prosecutions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The differences in the mandates and authority between the two NGO's and the ICTY have a number of implications, especially with regard to who is held responsible. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, the three organizations differ in the way each may be subject to varying degrees of political or other extra-judicial influence that may affect the conclusions of their reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fundamental difference between the mandates is found in Article One of the ICTY Statute, which enables the tribunal to prosecute individuals. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Benvenuti puts it,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>State responsibility has a wide scope because it includes all violations of [international humanitarian law] and, furthermore, it has a more &quot;objective&quot; character; while individual responsibility has a narrower scope because it includes only the &quot;grave breaches&quot; of [international humanitarian law] and, furthermore, in this regard the role of the subjective element of the conduct is much more relevant. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> With regard to the latter, the OTP report notes that &quot;the mens rea for the offence is intention or recklessness, not simple negligence.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is therefore probable that the OTP report may conclude that prosecution cannot be recommended because the subjective element is judged to be negligence and therefore insufficient for prosecution, even if a certain rule is considered to have been violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*774]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finally, it is worthwhile to briefly consider the differences between the NGOs and the ICTY with regard to the potential for political pressure. It is hardly fair to randomly accuse the OTP of succumbing to political pressure, whether in the present case of the NATO investigation or in any other case. On the other hand, one ought not discount completely the political environment in which the ICTY operates. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three of the states investigated by the OTP are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and have, in spite of the Tribunal's formal independence, significant influence on its future. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact that NATO member states constitute the core of the Stabilization Force (&quot;SFOR&quot;) in Bosnia, and subsequently the force in Kosovo (&quot;KFOR&quot;), means that the force being investigated is the same force upon which the OTP and the Tribunal is heavily dependent for arresting fugitives from previous Balkan wars. In any case, it would be naive to completely discount the political reality of the Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One example is the initial indictment against Slobodan Milosevic, which was completed in approximately fifty days during the conflict between NATO and the F.R.Y. in 1999. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although some Western observers viewed the indictment as a possible impediment to negotiations between NATO and Milosevic, it is somehow difficult to imagine that the indictment just happened to be finalized at that particular time, that it just happened to be limited in content to the conflict in Kosovo, and that it did not include the far more substantial allegations related to Croatia and Bosnia. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*775]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The focus of the present essay is an analysis of the treatment of the NATO action by the OTP Report. After some brief general remarks about the Report, this essay discusses the following three issues. First, it discusses use of cluster bombs in the Yugoslavian conflict. Next, the essay discusses two specific incidents that occurred during NATO's bombing campaign: the bombing of the RTS in Belgrade and the attack on a refugee convoy near Djakovica. In discussing these incidents, the essay refers to the observations by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of additional issues covered by the OTP Report will not be addressed: Hence, the essay does not discuss, for example, whether the potential damage to the environment violated the laws of armed conflict. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, this essay will not address a number of additional issues related to OAF, including deliberations in NATO concerning the use of electronic or cyber warfare and the question about a possible naval blockade of the Montenegrin coast in order to cut off the oil supply to the F.R.Y.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. GENERAL REMARKS ON THE OTP REPORT<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Following the publication of the OTP Report, the issue became one of authorship. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Substantial parts of the Report's discussion of the principles of warfare were drawn from an article written by &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*776]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  William Fenrick, Senior Legal Advisor at the OTP. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One might expect acknowledgement of this source, even if the OTP Report is not an academic work. It is, however, hard to find anything fundamentally wrong with such an approach. Indeed, one would expect that the considerations of principles related to warfare and the protection of civilians are universally applicable. Even so, the missing acknowledgement is surprising. Considering the importance of the OTP Report, one might also expect that resources are on hand to research and write a new report, thus avoiding the &quot;cut and paste&quot; method. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether due to the &quot;cut and paste&quot; approach or not, the OTP Report is incoherent. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among other things, one may inquire why, considering the Report is not an academic work, we are treated to some of the criticism of the definition of a military target found in the Additional Protocol I (1977) to the 1949 Geneva Conventions (&quot;API&quot;).This is particularly puzzling when the discussion is very brief, and ends with the conclusion that the API definition is &quot;the contemporary standard which must be used when attempting to determine the lawfulness of particular attacks.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One may also ask why the NATO campaign has to be considered in the context of aerial bombardments during the Second World War. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the Report exhibits a lack of consistency. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At one &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*777]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  point, it states that sixteen persons were killed during the attack on RTS, but states elsewhere that &quot;between [ten] and [seventeen] people are estimated to have been killed.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, the Report states that &quot;whether the media constitutes a legitimate target group is a debatable issue,&quot; but then finds that &quot;the media as such is not a traditional target category.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These few examples illustrate a more general failure of the Report to draw firm and clear conclusions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, one may question the proficiency and comprehensiveness of the research into factual circumstances of the incidents that the Report evaluates. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the introductory section, the Report lists the materials that have been consulted and remarks that &quot;the information available was adequate for making a preliminary assessment of incidents in which civilians were killed or injured.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Report, the F.R.Y. was not visited or asked to provide information because no official channels of communication existed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The subsequent sentence is somewhat surprising and contradictory when it states that the F.R.Y. &quot;submitted a substantial amount of material.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How was this possible if no channels of communication existed between the OTP and the F.R.Y.? The Report further states that &quot;very little information&quot; was accessible concerning &quot;communication targets,&quot; such as the RTS. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is difficult to understand how the Report can reconcile these findings with the statement that the amount of information was &quot;adequate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*778]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. CLUSTER BOMBS<BR>&nbsp;<BR> During and after OAF, NATO was criticized for its use of cluster bombs. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This criticism was directed partly at the actual use against certain targets, such as the bombing near the city of Nis on May 7, 1999, where a number of civilians were killed, and partly at the high dud rate of cluster munitions, which left an unknown number of unexploded bombs scattered throughout Serbia and Kosovo. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OTP Report's treatment of the use of cluster bombs is both unsatisfactorily brief and incomprehensive in manner. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The paragraph analyzing the issue draws three conclusions: (1) cluster bombs are not illegal weapons; (2) individual unexploded bombs from a cluster bomb are not legally comparable to landmines; and (3) cluster bombs were not used during Operation Allied Force in a manner similar to the Martic case, where cluster bombs were used against civilians in the Croatian capital Zagreb. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Amnesty International agreed that international humanitarian law does not include cluster bombs among prohibited weapons, the organization found that &quot;NATO failed to meet its obligations to take necessary precautions by using cluster weapons in the vicinity of civilian concentrations, thereby violating the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks under Article 51(4) and (5) of Protocol I.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*779]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The OTP Report does not consider whether NATO employed cluster bombs in any manner different to the Martic case, which might have been incompatible with international law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One could at least expect that the OTP Report would initially find that NATO did not intend to hit a hospital and a market place in Nis. NATO's explanation for this incident was that the cluster bombs were aimed at the airport near Nis but due to a malfunction, one or more containers holding the bombs opened too soon after release from the NATO aircraft, scattering the bombs over the city. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This explanation is parallel to the OTP Report's conclusion that civilians were not the intended targets. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n61</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even if is this is accepted, it does not necessarily follow that NATO or NATO personnel do not have any responsibility - criminal or other - for the deaths in Nis. This possibility is never addressed in the OTP Report, in spite of Amnesty International's conclusion that NATO did not take sufficient precautions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. THE TV STATION ATTACK<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Early in the morning of May 23, 1999, NATO aircraft attacked RadioTelevisija Srbije (&quot;RTS&quot;) in the center of Belgrade. There was, as Amnesty International puts it, &quot;no doubt that NATO hit the intended target.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The central questions in connection with this controversial attack are: (1) whether the TV station constituted a legitimate military target; and (2) if so, whether the number of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*780]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  civilian casualties was proportional to the military advantage expected from the partial or complete destruction of the TV station. The key to answering the first question is found in Article 52 (2) of the API:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Attacks shall be limited strictly to military objectives. In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Hence, the first question to be addressed pertains to the purpose or use of the RTS, i.e., the function at the specific time. It is possible that the RTS had a dual role, functioning as a civilian television station while at the same time playing some kind of military role, presumably connected to military communications. As the OTP Report puts it, &quot;to the extent particular media components are part of the C3 (command, control and communications) network they are military objectives. If media components are not part of the C3 network then they may become military objectives depending upon their use.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to evaluate the attack, one may consider the following three possibilities: (1) that the RTS was used for civilian broadcasting, including propaganda, which often did not accurately reflect objective facts but which in no way could be characterized as incitement to international criminal activity, for example, genocide; (2) that the RTS' broadcasts could be characterized as incitement to genocide; or (3) that the RTS functioned as in situation (1) and, in addition, had a military function. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*781]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. RTS as a Propaganda Organ<BR>&nbsp;<BR> A number of statements from NATO leaders and spokespersons indicate that RTS was perceived as a propaganda tool. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International refers to a meeting between the organization and NATO officials during which the officials &quot;insisted that the attack was carried out because RTS was a propaganda organ and that propaganda is direct support for military action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other examples include the British Minister for International Development, Clare Short, who stated that &quot;the propaganda machine [RTS] which is prolonging the war and meaning more and more of this brutality continues, is a legitimate target&quot; and that &quot;a propaganda machine that creates false propaganda constantly is a legitimate target and that's why it was hit.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon stated that &quot;[RTS] has misreported on what's going on in a way that has, I think, made it extremely difficult, impossible probably, for the Serb people to grasp the full magnitude of the problem in Kosovo.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As an example, he mentioned that the RTS characterized the Kosovar delegation to the Rambouillet negotiations that preceded the bombing campaign as &quot;terrorists and drug dealers&quot; while the station failed to mention the ethnic cleansing taking place in Kosovo. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Television stations (&quot;the installations of broadcasting and television stations&quot;) were included in a 1956 draft of API's definition of &quot;military targets.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This inclusion is occasionally emphasized as &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*782]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an indication that television stations generally constitute military targets. It is important to note, however, that &quot;even if [the potential targets] belong to one of [the listed target] categories, they cannot be considered as a military objective where their total or partial destruction, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers no military advantage.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, it is noteworthy that in the following year, the International Red Cross abandoned the draft, which contained a list of installations that are believed to be military targets, and subsequently adopted a more abstract definition of a military target found in the current version of the API. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 1956, the traditional notion of what constituted a military target may have changed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hence, the API draft from 1956 can only be considered of historical interest today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few are probably inclined to deny that the state-run Serbian radio and television stations were employed for propaganda and failed to broadcast a truthful rendition of events related to Kosovo. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question, however, remains whether this alone made the RTS a legitimate military target under API's definition. Does propaganda provide an &quot;effective contribution to military action&quot; and would its destruction offer a &quot;definite military advantage?&quot; In constructing an argument for the inclusion of television stations in the definition of military target, one might emphasize the central role of propaganda during military conflicts in general, and perhaps specifically, in the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*783]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kosovo conflict. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most may, however, find that the inclusion of propaganda as a military target will stretch the definition far, possibly too far. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, it appears very difficult to quantify the impact of propaganda from a certain outlet on the military action. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More importantly, there are potential threshold problems that will arise if propaganda is deemed to be a military target. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, the issue of what constitutes propaganda and who will define it comes to mind. If the Voice of America at times broadcasts official editorials from the United States Department of State, reflecting the official view of the U.S. government, does this constitute propaganda? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Does it make a difference if the Voice of America does not allow the Serbian government to broadcast similar editorials? Does propaganda have to be false or incorrect? What about withholding information? The Israeli media is partly subjected to military censorship, which may prevent Israeli media outlets from broadcasting information relating to a certain story. The general rational behind this is state security. Does this fact make the Israeli media a legitimate target? What if, in a hypothetical case, twenty persons were killed in an incident and the censor allowed the incident to be mentioned but either refused to disclose casualty &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*784]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  figures or claimed that none was killed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Generally, targeting propaganda outlets appears to be too open-ended and has the potential to substantially undercut the protection of civilian objects. The OTP Report is equivocal on this point by concluding that the legality of the attack on the RTS was &quot;debatable&quot; if the justification was that the target was a propaganda organ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Genocide<BR>&nbsp;<BR> A series of statements from NATO spokespersons conveyed the organization's belief that the RTS encouraged atrocities against the Kosovar-Albanian population and even incited genocide. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Pentagon, U.S. officials stated that the &quot;Serb TV [was] as much a part of Milosovic's murder machine as his military ... .&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The British had similar concerns, voiced by their Under Secretary of State:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>We are very clear that the station that was hit [RTS] recently was an absolutely key part of the hate campaign from the Serbian regime... . So we are not talking about an independent media in that sense, we are talking about a core part of preparation of the Serbian people and the confusion of the Serbian people as to actually the situation around the country, what is actually happening in Kosovo, but even more importantly pouring out racist attacks in a constant barrage in order to create the background for the ethnic cleansing that has then taken place, not just here but in previous campaigns by the Serbian regime. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> In spite of these and similar statements, the OTP Report determined that &quot;it was not claimed that the [Serbian TV-and radio stations] were used to incite violence akin to Radio Milles Collines during the Rwandan genocide, which might have justified their &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*785]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  destruction.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the complaint to the ECHR, the plaintiffs argued that even though the British Ministry of Trade and Industry claimed that RTS broadcasts &quot;included propaganda inciting genocide and racial hatred,&quot; there was no proof to substantiate these allegations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, while the question of incitement to genocide does not arise in the context of the Serbian TV station, potential attacks against such broadcasting facilities do, however, raise a number of difficult and challenging problems in abstracto. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the definition of a military target found in API is accepted as authoritative, it is very difficult to place institutions that incite genocide within this definition. One author argues that &quot;there is, of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*786]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  course, no necessary relationship between the use of a facility to commit a war crime and the classification of that facility as a military objective.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the surface at least, a broadcasting station that incites genocide does not make an effective contribution to military activities and its destruction would, therefore, not constitute a clear military advantage. On the contrary, to the extent the armed forces participate in the genocide, this would appear, from a cynical point of view, to detract from their contribution to legal military efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One could argue, however, that the genocide was an integral part of the military campaign, in which case military &quot;success&quot; had to be measured according to the number of civilian casualties from a specific ethnic group. From such a perspective, the criteria of &quot;effective contribution&quot; would have been fulfilled. Even such a distorted deliberation, however, would not account for &quot;definite military advantage&quot; if the enemy regarded the genocide as being without military significance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the above comments demonstrate, &quot;extra-military&quot; arguments fit poorly within the context and terminology found in the API. In addition, once such arguments are introduced, it would make it easier for a military force to attack a broadcasting station that does not incite genocide. Consider a revolutionary government that announces over its radio stations that it intends to destroy all private property in territory it has occupied. If such a policy is assumed to violate Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, does said statement make the radio stations legitimate military targets? Clearly, it does not. One can argue that there is a huge difference between genocide and the destruction of private property. This is beyond doubt, but the point is that if &quot;extra-military&quot; arguments are introduced, it is difficult, if not impossible to distinguish formally between the two examples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on the notion of a &quot;generalized right to prevent the continuing commission of crimes,&quot; one may, however, &quot;suggest that a facility which is being used to incite the commission of serious violation of international humanitarian law or to provide the location for the commission of such an offence may be lawfully attacked even &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*787]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if it did not meet the criteria for a military objective.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concepts such as &quot;some generalized right&quot; are difficult for lawyers to conceptualize and to use as justification, for example, of an attack on a radio station. However, this proposal may be the best option at present. The legitimate and moral goal of stopping genocide outweighs the concerns related to conceptualization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, in the context of humanitarian intervention such as the Kosovo conflict, however, one may be able to suggest an additional justification for attacking a broadcasting station that incites genocide. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This justification is based on a well-known legal principle, in maiore minus, and assumes that jus ad bellum considerations may aid and support the interpretation of the jus in bello corpus. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The questions concerning the legality of resorting to the use of force and the actual conduct of hostilities have traditionally been separated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>It is a basic premise of the law of war (or of armed conflict) radically to separate jus in bello from jus ad bellum, a premise without which it would be impossible to apply the fundamental principle that underlie the whole edifice of jus in bello, i.e., the principle of the equality of the parties. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*788]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The reason for this separation is to be found in the fact that humanitarian law of armed conflict is intended to protect individuals, primarily vulnerable and helpless individuals such as civilians, the sick, and the wounded. Such a purpose is better achieved by avoiding any considerations about how the conflict originated. Considering this principled background, it would not, however, be unreasonable to let jus ad bellum justifications, such as humanitarian intervention, influence, or aid in the interpretation of jus in bello rules, as long as the goal and objective is a better, more comprehensive protection of individual persons. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stated purpose of and justification for Operation Allied Force was based on humanitarian intervention &quot;to stop the killing in Kosovo and the brutal destruction of human lives and properties; to put an end to the appalling humanitarian situation that is now unfolding in Kosovo,&quot; and was initiated in order to save the Kosovar-Albanian civilian population from deportation, deprivation, or worse. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If it is possible to justify a sustained bombing campaign in order to stop genocide, it would appear, a fortiori, to be justifiable to take measures to halt incitement to genocide, as propagated by a radio or television station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Military Function<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Surprisingly, it is difficult to find clear statements from NATO alleging that the RTS had a military function. Amnesty International quotes NATO officials as saying that the RTS was &quot;used as radio relay stations and transmitters to support the activities of the F.R.Y. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*789]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  military and special police forces.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OTP Report uses this statement as proof of the RTS's military function. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International, however, firmly maintains that NATO subsequently emphasized that the RTS was attacked solely because it was an organ of propaganda. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, Human Rights Watch appears to doubt that the RTS had a military function. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, the complaint to the ECHR holds that &quot;there was and is no evidence that the RTS building in Belgrade was, at any point, part of Milosovic's &quot;war machine'&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that &quot;it [had] never been claimed by the respondent Governments that it was used to relay military communications.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OTP Report quotes NATO statements from April 27, 1999, four days after the attack, indicating that the RTS did have a dual-use function. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Wesley Clark then stated, &quot;As I said, it's essentially a dual-nature system ... military [radio] traffic is also routed through the civilian system.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OTP Report clearly states the questions that are central to the attack on the RTS. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OTP Report, however, fails to conclude &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*790]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  whether and to what degree the RTS or its components were in fact part of the C3 structure or had any other military function. The Report also fails to determine whether the RTS was a legitimate target according to the criteria in API. In fact, the OTP Report does not even identify NATO's justification for its attack on the RTS. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OTP Report states that the attack was legal to the extent that NATO attempted to disrupt the F.R.Y.'s C3 network, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> whereas the legality of the attack was &quot;debatable&quot; if it was justified only because the RTS was a propaganda organ. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As mentioned above, the Committee behind the Report found that it possessed enough information to make a sound evaluation. When examining the most controversial attack during the entire campaign, it should have been possible to determine whether the target was a legal target or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. Proportionality<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Quite a lot has been made of the fact that the attack only disrupted the RTS's television broadcast for a few hours. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critics note this fact as proof that the bombing did not provide a &quot;definite military advantage.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This argument, however, appears to be based on a confusion of various aspects of the attack. If it is assumed that normal television broadcasts do not constitute a legitimate military &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*791]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  target, then the duration of the interruption cannot influence the legality of the attack. What is determinative is how the attack influenced any military components or communications, which may, in the first place, legitimize the attack. One may be able to draw a conclusion based on an analogy to the amount of time it took to restore the civilian television signal and assume that the restoration of military communications would take a similar amount of time. This, however, would appear to be mere speculation. Hence, it is not particularly useful and does not further a legal analysis when Amnesty International, for example, observes that &quot;NATO deliberately attacked a civilian object, killing [sixteen] civilians, for the purpose of disrupting Serbian television broadcasts in the middle of the night for approximately three hours. It is hard to see how this can be consistent with the rule of proportionality.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assuming that the RTS was a legitimate military target, the subsequent question must concern whether the number of casualties - sixteen civilian Serbs - was proportional to the military advantage gained by destroying the TV station. API prohibits indiscriminate attacks. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Included among the types of attacks that are considered indiscriminate is &quot;an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question of excess is most often referred to as the principle of proportionality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How are we to weigh the loss of sixteen lives vis-a-vis the military advantage gained by the destruction of the TV station and the resulting temporary disruption of military communication? The treatment of this essential question in the OTP Report is confusing. In reviewing the applicable law regarding target selection, the OTP &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*792]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Report states that questions arising in the context of the proportionality principle must be addressed on &quot;a case by case basis.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This approach parallels the view that potential war crimes are individual crimes that have to be evaluated case by case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the OTP Report determines that when analyzing the attack on the RTS, the legal evaluation of &quot;the proportionality of the attack should not be premised on a specific incident.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This means the individual attack on the RTS and the civilian casualties are not the main focus. Rather, the attack on the RTS must be viewed as one phase of &quot;an integrated attack&quot; against multiple objects. The legal evaluation must take into account this plurality of targets, which constitutes the overall strategic goal, the Yugoslav C3 structure. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If consistently applied, the logic presented by the OTP Report will end by weighing the total number of casualties, around five hundred, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the entire Operation Allied Force. Even if the total number of civilian casualties was limited in light of the extent and intensity of the bombing campaign, it is questionable whether such a comparison is useful for anything. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An initial complaint is that the accumulation of targets in the OTP Report, allegedly belonging to the same &quot;integrated attack,&quot; is based on a collection of NATO press releases. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The more serious &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*793]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  problem, however, is whether it is permissible to dilute the significance of a single attack by pouring it into the sea of integrated attacks. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least two aspects of this question must be addressed: (1) the authority of the approach followed by the OTP Report; and (2) to what extent the approach is acceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Kupreskic Case<BR>&nbsp;<BR> According to the OTP Report, the foundation for the integrated attack theory appears to be a somewhat backward interpretation of dictum delivered by the ICTY Trial Chamber in the Kupreskic case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tribunal concluded that repeated, individual legal attacks might be illegal because the described pattern of attacks places the &quot;lives and assets&quot; of civilians in great jeopardy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OTP Report completely misconstrues the Trial Chamber's dictum by concluding that it meant to compare the total number of casualties with the overall goals of the military action. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, while the Tribunal determined, in a hypothetical case, that a series of legal attacks may be deemed illegal when accumulated, the OTP Report stipulates that an attack that is illegal in and of itself (due to excessive civilian casualties) becomes legal when viewed in the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*794]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  context of the &quot;integrated attack&quot; theory. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a highly original use of precedence. For one thing, it raises a serious issue of double standards at the tribunal. The accused in the Kupreskic case, Croats from the former Yugoslavia, could be judged according to the broad interpretation adopted by the Trial Chamber, but when investigating the NATO countries, the OTP Report adopts a significantly narrower standard, to the extent that the standards are reconcilable at all. Moreover, it would appear to be untraditional for a prosecutorial authority to undercut the court that may subsequently decide the case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If a court has adopted a broad interpretation that works to the detriment of the accused, prosecutors will rarely fail to follow through. One possible explanation is, of course, that the prosecutorial authority is looking for reasons not to prosecute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Is the &quot;Integrated Attack&quot; Approach Correct?<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The next fundamental question relates to whether an attack, such as the one against the RTS, should be judged individually or rather, as implied by the OTP Report, be viewed in a larger context. A number of authors advocate that the individual attack against the individual target must be the point of concern. Bernard Brown, for example, found that &quot;both policy factors and the language of the [articles of the Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law Applicable in Armed Conflicts] support a &quot;case by case' interpretation of military advantage.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*795]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such a case-by-case approach appears, however, to be too narrow and unrealistic in practice. A number of states entered declarations concerning the issue during the negotiations of API. Italy, for example, noted that the evaluation of the military advantage, which forms part of the principle of proportionality, must be considered on the basis of &quot;the attack as a whole and not in relation to each action regarded separately.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To this, the API Commentary replied, &quot;these statements, which all have the same tenor, seem redundant; it goes without saying that an attack carried out in a concerted manner in numerous places can only be judged in its entirety.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This commentary does not, however, contribute to a more thorough understanding of what &quot;an attack carried out in a concerted manner&quot; includes. Does it cover the entire Operation Allied Force, as the OTP Report intimates? In that case, the principle of proportionality is a reality without any normative constraint or content. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, it is hardly surprising that the API Commentary finds that &quot;[[Article 57 (2)(a)(iii)] like Article 51 ... is not concerned with strategic objectives but with the means to be used in a specific tactical operation.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Louise Doswald-Beck, who partly accepts the mentioned declarations, proposes a similar interpretation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*796]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  interpretation narrows the scale substantially, and Doswald-Beck provides an example in which six military targets are considered as one attack when weighing the military advantage and the principle of proportionality. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This interpretation fundamentally differs from the list of targets that the OTP Report suggests belong to the same &quot;integrated attack.&quot; The limitation to &quot;a given tactical operation&quot; is both sound and reasonable as opposed to the &quot;integrated attack&quot; approach adopted by the OTP Report, which, as pointed out, logically will end up comparing the complete number of casualties to the entire bombing campaign, thereby robbing the principle of proportionality of any restraining power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E. The Complaint to the European Court of Human Rights<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Relatives of persons killed during the attack on the RTS have made a complaint to the ECHR in Strasbourg. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The complaint asks the Court to find that member states of NATO violated articles 2 (right to life), 10 (freedom of expression) and 13 (right to an effective remedy) of the European Human Rights Convention (&quot;the Convention&quot;). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Question of Admissibility<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The initial question for the ECHR was whether the complaint was admissible. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The answer to this question turned on the interpretation &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*797]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the term &quot;jurisdiction&quot; in Article 1 of the Convention. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Applying the rules of interpretation found in the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Court determined that the term &quot;jurisdiction&quot; in Article 1 encompasses an essentially territorial notion. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n136</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Court, however, proceeded to acknowledge that non-territorial bases of jurisdiction might be contemplated, although they would be exceptional and require special justification. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n137</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Court's jurisprudence contains examples of jurisdiction beyond the purely territorial, most notably, in the present context, the Loizidou Case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n138</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hence, the Court needed to determine whether circumstances &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*798]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  surrounding the bombing of the RTS were equally exceptional &quot;such that they amounted to the extra-territorial exercise of jurisdiction by a Contracting State.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n139</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court determined that the required exceptional circumstances were absent in the RTS bombing case, primarily by distinguishing it from the Loizidou decision. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n140</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Loizidou, Turkey's army had exercised &quot;effective control&quot; over part of Cyprus. Generally, the Court recognizes extra-territorial jurisdiction where the respondent state, &quot;through the effective control of the relevant territory and its inhabitants abroad as a consequence of military occupation or through the consent, invitation or acquiescence of the Government of the territory, [exercises] all or some of the public powers normally to be exercised by that Government.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n141</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the dicta from Louzidou and other cases dealing with extra-territoriality are construed in this manner, it becomes obvious that NATO did not exercise the requisite &quot;effective control.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n142</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, Cyprus is a party to the European Convention on Human Rights. If Turkey's de facto control over the northern part of Cyprus had not been held to bring that territory within the jurisdiction of Turkey, the inhabitants of this part of Cyprus would &quot;have found themselves excluded from the benefits of the Convention.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n143</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The F.R.Y., however, is not a party to the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*799]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Convention. Thus, the Court's decision to hold the Complaint inadmissible does not deprive F.R.Y. civilians of rights they would otherwise possess under the European Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When considering extra-territorial jurisdiction, it is somewhat unclear whether both &quot;effective control,&quot; as stipulated under Bankovic, and the loss of otherwise held rights must be present. This arguably appears to be the case. n144Thus, the decision in the Bankovic case appears to have closed the somewhat open-ended dictum pertaini</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>ng</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to extra-territorial exercise of jurisdiction found in the Loizidou judgment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n145</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In essence, the Court has now firmly limited the application of the Convention to Europe. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n146</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, if soldiers from a Contracting State on a peace-keeping mission mistreat detained locals, it would appear that the mistreated persons could not seek final redress through the ECHR even if the mission resulted in &quot;effective control&quot; outside Convention territory. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n147</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One can debate whether such consequences are desirable or not. As to the possible policy considerations behind the Court's decision, one may suggest that the increasing use of national and international tribunals to correct real and imagined wrongs may have played a part. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n148</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although all potential &quot;extra-territorial complaints&quot; would &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*800]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not be considered frivolous, the ECHR may have had a realistic fear of being inundated by complaints from around the world. Furthermore, it is difficult to entirely dismiss the concern expressed by the governments regarding possible consequences for future collective military actions, including U.N. actions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n149</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Human Rights Law and Humanitarian Law<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Since the Court found that Bankovic did not come within the jurisdiction of the respondent states, the subsequent questions become somewhat academic but still interesting: 1) which rights protected by the Convention were in fact violated; and 2) how the Court would examine this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right to life will briefly be considered. Initially, it may appear surprising that an act of war or armed conflict such as the bombing of the RTS can be evaluated under human rights standards. This surprise is based on the traditional division between the (international) law of peace and the (international) law of war, where human rights belong to the former category. From a principled perspective, however, an &quot;integral linkage [exists] between the law of human rights and humanitarian law because they share a &quot;common nucleus of non-derogable rights and a common purpose of protecting human life and dignity.'&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n150</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, this division is not apparent from a human rights perspective and the European Convention from 1950 states explicitly which rights may be derogated from during wartime and which will &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*801]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  remain in effect. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n151</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, during the past decades, there has been an increasing convergence between rules from human rights law and rules from international humanitarian law. One author is able to date the beginning of this development to the United Nations Human Rights Conference in Teheran in 1968. In Teheran, international humanitarian law was &quot;transformed into a branch of human rights law and termed &quot;human rights in armed conflicts ... .'&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n152</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, post-Cold War developments have added to the attraction of applying international humanitarian law to human rights. One author noted &quot;the change in direction toward intrastate or mixed conflicts - the context of contemporary atrocities - has drawn humanitarian law in the direction of human rights law.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n153</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Additionally, both the Inter-American and the European human rights regimes have recently examined cases that included aspects of armed conflict and international humanitarian law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n154</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, any remaining doubt about the continued relevance of human rights during war or armed conflict has been removed by the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*802]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  International Court of Justice in its 1996 Advisory Opinion concerning nuclear weapons:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Court observes that the protection of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights does not cease in times of war, except by operation of Article 4 of the Covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in time of national emergency. In principle, the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one's life applies also in hostilities. The test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life, however, then falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict, which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities. Thus whether a particular loss of life, through the use of a certain weapon in warfare, is to be considered an arbitrary deprivation of life contrary to Article 6 of the Covenant, can only be decided by reference to the law applicable in armed conflict and not deduced from the terms of the Covenant itself. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n155</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Confirming the continued relevance of human rights during armed conflict, the International Court also emphasizes that the evaluation of a potential violation of the right to life claim must be conducted with reference to international humanitarian law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n156</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This dictum appears to fit well with Article 15 of the European Convention, which deals with possible derogation from the rights protected by the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*803]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Convention. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n157</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Article 15, the right to life protected by Article 2 is non-derogable during times of war or other public emergencies, &quot;except in respect of deaths resulting from lawful acts of war.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n158</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Determining the lawfulness of acts of war appears best done according to jus in bello.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ECHR has, on occasion, made implicit use of international humanitarian law, most notably in cases concerning the situation in southeastern Turkey. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n159</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aisling Reidy, however, finds that the Court may be reluctant to make explicit references to international humanitarian law, in spite of considering a humanitarian law context. He notes that this reluctance might be due to the scarcity of cases dealing with situations where international humanitarian law is applicable, such as the one contained in the complaint against the NATO member states. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n160</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*804]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When considering the potential for the future application of international humanitarian law before the European Court of Human Rights, one must be mindful of the boundaries established in the Bankovic decision, particularly in cases involving the right to life. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n161</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As part of their argument for admissibility, the applicants relied both on the ordre public mission of the Convention and on Article 15 for a broad understanding of the term jurisdiction. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n162</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Court, however, dismissed both approaches and emphasized that the Convention is a &quot;constitutional instrument for European public order&quot; and that Article 15 must &quot;be read subject to the &quot;jurisdiction' limitation enumerated in Article 1.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n163</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Considering how narrowly the Court construed the term &quot;jurisdiction&quot; with regard to extra-territorial acts, it seems doubtful that more traditional armed conflict situations will reach the Court. If it is accepted that international humanitarian law will only flourish at the European Court in such traditional inter-state armed conflict situations, it appears unlikely that international humanitarian law will play a substantive part in the Court's judgments in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IV. THE ATTACK AT DJAKOVICA<BR>&nbsp;<BR> One point of criticism directed at NATO's actions in OAF concerned the altitude from which several NATO attacks were conducted. The altitude was particularly central in the context of a number of attacks near Djakovica on April 14, 1999. For several days, the specific circumstances surrounding the attacks were in dispute. Most observers now seem to agree that NATO aircraft attacked one or more convoys of Albanian refugees due to mistaken identification. As many as seventy-five civilians are believed to have been killed. It is still unclear whether any military vehicles were part &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*805]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the convoy. It is reasonable to conclude, however, that the NATO aircraft did not intentionally target the civilian convoys in order to hit the refugees, even if the OTP Report does mention one source believing this to be the case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n164</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The important question is not whether the convoy constituted a military target, but rather, whether NATO took sufficient precautions in order to determine and verify that the target was legitimate. According to the API, Article 57(2)(a)(i), those who plan or decide upon an attack shall inter alia do &quot;everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects...&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n165</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The difficulties connected to the interpretation of the word &quot;feasible&quot; are legion. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n166</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the time of ratification, a number of countries entered their understanding of the word, understanding the term &quot;everything feasible&quot; to mean &quot;everything that was practicable or practically possible, taking into account all the circumstances at the time of the attack, including those relevant to the success of military operations.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n167</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The API Commentary emphasizes that the general reference to &quot;the success of military operations&quot; involves a risk of depriving the rule of any significant normative content. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n168</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The API Commentary itself does not attempt to formulate any precise definition and merely states that any interpretation is fundamentally a question of &quot;common sense and good faith.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n169</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concerning the obligation to distinguish and the altitude of fifteen thousand feet, the OTP Report found that &quot;the fifteen thousand feet minimum altitude adopted for part of the campaign may have meant that the target could not be verified with the naked eye&quot;. It appears, however, &quot;that with the use of modern technology, the obligation to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*806]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  distinguish was effectively carried out in the vast majority of cases during the bombing campaign.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n170</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This finding naturally leads one to question to what extent the obligation to distinguish was respected in the residual small minority of cases. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n171</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the attack at Djakovica, there was at least some doubt about what was observed on the ground. &quot;NATO itself claimed that although the cockpit video showed the vehicles to look like tractors, when viewed with the naked eye from the attack altitude they appeared to be military vehicles.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n172</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If one indicator, the video, conveyed one thing and the other indicator, the eye of the pilot, conveyed something else, it would be fair to conclude that there was some degree of doubt about what was being observed. Interestingly, the OTP Report implicitly commends NATO for suspending the attack as soon as the presence of civilians was &quot;suspected.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n173</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to this rendition, attacks are apparently allowed if there is doubt, as long as the attackers do not actually &quot;suspect&quot; civilian presence. Here, suspicion would seem to demand some cognition beyond mere doubt. Such an understanding goes against the general principle found in the API. For example, Articles 50(1) and 52(3) hold that in case of doubt, persons and objects are presumed to be civilian in nature. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n174</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Precautionary Measures<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The OTP Report failed to evaluate the legality of the individual attack near Djakovica. The Report dismisses the idea that precautions taken, or not taken, can be judged with reference to &quot;a specific incident&quot; and proceeds to determine that to the extent &quot;precautionary measures have worked adequately in a high percentage of cases then the fact they have not worked well in a small number of cases does &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*807]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not necessarily mean they are generally inadequate.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n175</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This interpretation of international humanitarian law is, of course, a perfect fit with the overall findings of the OTP Report concerning the NATO air campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This statement is problematic for several reasons. First, it allows the attacker, in this case NATO, to excuse a few transgressions or mistakes as long as they are seen in a sufficiently broad perspective. Such an approach may, as noted by Paolo Benvenuti, lead to the misconception that &quot;war crimes occur and should be prosecuted only if committed in the context of a plan or of a large-scale commission, when the inadequacy of precautionary measures is deliberate on the part of the warring party.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n176</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benvenuti adds that &quot;it is only when each attack is considered in its specific circumstances that it is possible to say whether or not all practicable precautions have been taken and whether or not the attack constitutes a breach of [international humanitarian law].&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n177</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, even if the statement on the surface may generally appear to be correct, it cannot possibly be correct at any given time. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n178</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consider, for example, an attack against a railroad bridge, which is considered to be a legitimate military target. Prior to the attack, a number of precautions are taken, but at no point is the train schedule consulted. Assume ten of such bridges are attacked. The first nine attacks are carried out smoothly with no collateral damage because no trains were close to the bridges at the time of the attacks. During the tenth and final attack, a train happens to be on the bridge. Can we, based on the dictum of the OTP Report, conclude that since everything went well in nine of ten cases, that sufficient precaution &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*808]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had been taken? It would appear so, but is this legally correct? If the final attack had been the first, it would have been obvious that the precautions had been insufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a similar fashion, we may consider attacks carried out from an altitude of fifteen thousand feet. Assume ten attacks take place. Assume, also, that a number of precautions have been taken, but in reality the pilots are unable to determine positively whether the convoy on the ground contains civilian vehicles. In nine of the ten cases, it turns out that the convoys consisted solely of military vehicles. The tenth convoy attacked, however, was civilian. Can we conclude that because the first nine convoys happened to be military, that the attackers had fulfilled their obligations under Article 57 of the API?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What consequences do these deliberations have for a legal evaluation of the NATO attack near Djakovica? Amnesty International posits that the decision by NATO to conduct attacks from an altitude of fifteen thousand feet &quot;may well have contributed to an indiscriminate attack, in breach of international humanitarian law.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n179</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, Human Rights Watch concludes that the fact that NATO subsequently altered its procedures &quot;indicates that the alliance recognized that it had taken insufficient precautions in mounting this attack, in not identifying the civilians present, and in assuming that the intended targets were legitimate military objectives rather that in positively identifying them.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n180</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Report from the OTP finds that the altitude, combined with other circumstances, such as the speed of the aircraft, make it difficult for the crew to distinguish civilian from military vehicles. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n181</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*809]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Report concluded that the crew would have benefited from observing the potential target from a lower altitude. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n182</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Report, however, does not find proof of recklessness, which is a requirement for criminal prosecution. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n183</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One may read the OTP deliberation as an implicit confirmation that NATO violated Article 57 of the API, but that the mens rea failed to qualify the violation for prosecution. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n184</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If this reading is accepted, the three reports concur regarding this specific incident. Yet, to the detriment of the OTP Report and the future of international humanitarian law, clear conclusions are never drawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. More Moral Considerations<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In addition to the preceding lex lata observations, it may be worthwhile to contribute a few ethical or lex ferenda considerations, which may assist in the interpretation of the elusive demands of Article 57. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n185</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Each mission flown or each attack conducted involves a certain risk of unwanted casualties, such as casualties among friendly forces or among civilians. As proven during Operation Allied Force, the risk may not materialize very often. It is often possible to shift the risk between the NATO pilot and the civilian on the ground. If the pilot flies at a high altitude, he reduces the risk to himself, but civilians on the ground become harder to identify. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n186</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The risk, by contrast, is shifted towards the pilot if he flies low in order to make a positive identification of the target. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n187</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*810]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These considerations are valid in any armed conflict. Michael Waltzer, for one, describes a similar situation during the Korean War. There, the specific question concerned whether to employ artillery against suspected enemy positions with a high risk of civilian casualties, or to send out a patrol in order to identify enemy positions more precisely. He writes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Even if the proportions work out favorably [i.e., only limited civilian casualties] ... we would still want to say, I think, that the patrol must be sent out, the risk accepted, before the big guns are brought to bear. The soldiers sent on patrol can plausibly argue that they never chose to make war in Korea; they are soldiers nevertheless; there have obligations that go with their war rights, and the first of these is the obligation to attend to the rights of civilians - more precisely, of those civilians whose lives they themselves endanger. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n188</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Deliberations such as these are now partly guided by API. In reality, however, the partial guidance only helps to solve the easy questions and lets the subtle situations such as the example from Kosovo go unresolved. Based on deliberations outlined above, which conclude that radio stations can be legitimate targets in cases where they incite genocide, one may also consider whether jus ad bellum &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*811]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  considerations may assist the interpretation of jus in bello rules in the present case. If an attack on a radio station can be justified by in majore minus, the following parallel appears appropriate to draw: if Operation Allied Force is legally justified as a humanitarian intervention, i.e., to save the Kosovar-Albanian population, it would be hard to justify an allocation of the risk of casualties onto the Kosovar-Albanian population in order to avoid losses among NATO pilots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OTP Report makes references to similar deliberations. The Report finds that &quot;the application of the definition [of a military target] to particular objects may also differ depending on the scope and objectives of the conflict.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n189</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These latter &quot;objectives&quot; may be presumed to be closely intertwined with the reasons for the initiation of Operation Allied Force, i.e., jus ad bellum. It is, however, doubtful whether this OTP statement lends itself to the interpretation proposed here. As Michael Bothe observes, the OTP Report fails to investigate the question of whether:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Traditional considerations of military necessity and military advantage have a legitimate place in a conflict the declared purpose of which is a humanitarian one, namely to promote the cause of human rights. The thought would deserve further consideration that in such type of a conflict, more severe restraints would be imposed on the choice of military targets and of balancing test applied for the purposes of the proportionality principle that in a normal armed conflict. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n190</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> The Independent International Commission on Kosovo (&quot;Commission&quot;) submitted a proposal with a similar interpretation. The Commission advocates that the International Red Cross draft a new convention to cover military operations during humanitarian interventions that would restrain the use of force to a further degree than what is currently permitted under the laws of armed conflict. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n191</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*812]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCLUSION<BR>&nbsp;<BR> When the member states of NATO decided to initiate Operation Allied Force, few governments probably contemplated that they risked defending their actions before an international court. The increasing presence and importance of international courts appear to be the way of the future, whether one likes it or not. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n192</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ICTY is one court before which NATO leaders will not have to appear. Although the Court clearly had jurisdiction, the prosecutor at the Court decided to follow the advice of the Committee that no formal investigation be initiated. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n193</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even if one is inclined to agree with the conclusion of the OTP Report, it is very difficult to accept the reasoning and the ambiguities of the Report. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n194</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An inability or unwillingness to determine the facts, as well as a subsequent inability to apply legal rules to those facts, mars the OTP Report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aversion to drawing concrete and firm conclusions has further consequences beyond bringing peace of mind to NATO leaders. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n195</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As W.J. Fenrick notes, &quot;to the extent the media is identified as a separate target category, Operation Allied Force may represent an attempt to broaden rather than narrow the range of objects regarded as lawful military objectives.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n196</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OTP Report did not retard such a development, which it could have done by clearly stating that television stations are not military targets unless they fulfill the criteria in API, Article 52(2). Deliberations concerning the targeting &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*813]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of television stations tie in with broader discussions regarding the use of military force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Operation Allied Force, many Americans advocated more substantial attacks on strategic targets in Serbia, including in Serbian cities. This advocacy is connected to recent theories about the use of air power to target the infrastructure of the enemy state. As J.W. Crawford comments, potential consequences would be &quot;the indirect targeting of the civilian population, euphemistically referred to as &quot;popular support.'&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n197</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This development might be effective from a military point of view, but it is hardly recommendable from a humanitarian point of view. Even if the OTP Report did not intend to encourage the trend toward broadening the range of lawful military targets, the equivocal findings of the Report do not impede such a finding. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n198</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the Report's interpretation of the principle of proportionality is detrimental to humanitarian concerns. The wide interpretation of what should be included in the evaluation of the expected military advantage threatens the normative restraint of the principle of proportionality. Even if it is agreed that an evaluation of each individual attack would be too narrow, the logic of the OTP Report seems irreconcilable with reasonable humanitarian considerations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c21"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, in light of the conclusions drawn here, it would have been preferable if the OTP had conducted a formal investigation. On the whole, there seems to be enough doubt to warrant such a formal investigation, and the doubt should not necessarily benefit NATO in &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*814]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the present circumstances. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>n199</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, additional and necessary facts, which were clearly absent from the OTP Report in spite of assertions to the contrary, could have been established and some of the problematic interpretations could have been challenged and amended.</SPAN></P>

Among its general conclusions, Amnesty International stated that &quot;in one instance, the attack on the headquarters of the Serbian state radio and television (RTS), NATO launched a direct attack on a civilian object, killing sixteen civilians. Such attack breached article 52 (I) of Protocol I and therefore constitutes a war crime.&quot; Amnesty Report, supra note 24, at 25. In contrast, Human Rights Watch found &quot;no evidence of war crimes. The investigation did conclude that NATO violated international humanitarian law.&quot; HRW Report, supra note 8, at 3.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c34">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Petitioner alien, an ethnic Serb, who was born in Yugoslavia, filed a petition for judicial review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) upholding a decision of an immigration judge (IJ), which denied his request for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1231(b)(3)(A) and for other relief. The IJ found that the government rebutted the alien's fear of persecution due to changed country conditions from a change in government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c34">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">The alien was involved with a political party opposing the government, and he was severely beaten by government supporters while speaking in opposition to the government. The IJ found that this incident constituted past persecution under &sect; 1231(b)(3)(A), but that the fear of future persecution was rebutted by a change of country conditions from the overthrow of the government and the death of its leader. On appeal, the alien argued that his claim of persecution was based on the actions of purely local officials, and thus that the change in government could not constitute a change in country conditions sufficient to rebut the presumption of future persecution. However, this argument was never presented to the IJ or BIA. Even if this claim was properly exhausted, the court found that there was adequate evidence to support the IJ's decision because at the hearing, the persecution suffered by the alien was tied to his actions opposing the government, and the perpetrators were consistently identified as government supporters. Thus, the IJ properly concluded that, upon the removal of this government, the alien no longer feared future persecution for his actions against the government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*568]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ROVNER, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Circuit Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Petitioner appeals the Board of Immigration Appeal's (BIA) denial of his request for withholding of removal. We note at the outset that although the caption of the case identifies petitioner as Vecislay Milanouic, he made it clear at the hearing before the Immigration Judge that his name is actually spelled Vecislav Milanovic. We will refer to Milanovic by the spelling that he has declared to be the correct one in this opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milanovic, an ethnic Serb, was born in Yugoslavia and came to this country as a non-immigrant visitor in February 1996. He did not leave the country when his authorization expired in July 1996, and on September 24, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security served him with a Notice to Appear charging that he was subject &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[**2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to removal because he had remained longer than his visa allowed. Milanovic subsequently applied for asylum, withholding of removal under &sect; 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied that relief after an evidentiary hearing, but granted him voluntary departure under &sect; 240B of the INA.&nbsp;8 U.S.C. &sect; 1229c. Milanovic then appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the IJ in an order dated September 24, 2008. He now appeals to this court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milanovic's asylum claim was based upon actions taken against him when he lived in the former Yugoslavia, and on the threat to his sons of conscription in the Serbian army should they return. Milanovic testified at the hearing that he served in the military in the former Yugoslavia between 1979 and 1980. In 1993, he was again called upon to serve in the military, and was sent to Kosovo on maneuvers for 15 days. He fled towards Serbia, and was caught by the military police and detained for 45 days, during which time he was mistreated by the military police. After the 45 days passed, he returned home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*569]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He subsequently became involved in supporting the Serbian Renewal &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[**3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party against the governing Socialist Party which was led by Slobodan Milosevic. In September 1995, he was at a restaurant speaking to others about opposing the government, when Milosevic supporters-- led by a local official who was a member of the Socialist Party, Ratko Zecevic, and several policemen --severely beat him. He suffered serious injuries as a result of that beating, which required hospitalization and resulted in the removal of one of his testicles. Those incidents form the basis of his claim for asylum and withholding of removal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IJ denied the asylum claim as untimely, rejecting Milanovic's contention that the potential conscription of his son constituted a changed circumstance justifying the delay. In so holding, the IJ noted that his son's potential conscription was distinct from the political activities that formed the genesis of his claim, that it was not a harm to Milanovic himself, and that in any case it was not timely raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IJ proceeded to address Milanovic's claim for withholding of removal.  [HN1] An alien is entitled to withholding of removal if he can demonstrate a clear probability that his life or freedom would be threatened based on his race, religion, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[**4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(b)(3)(A); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Ishitiaq v. Holder</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 578 F.3d 712, 717 (7th Cir. 2009); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Patel v. Holder</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 581 F.3d 631, 634 (7th Cir. 2009). Once an alien establishes that he was subject to past persecution, that triggers a rebuttable presumption of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. &sect; 1208.16(b)(1); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Ishitiaq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 578 F.3d at 717; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Patel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 581 F.3d at 634. The government may rebut that presumption by demonstrating--by a preponderance of the evidence--either a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant's fear is no longer reasonable, or that the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the country and that it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so. 8 C.F.R. &sect; 1208.16(b)(1). The burden of proof to rebut that presumption is on the government. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Id</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IJ found that the incident involving the military police was insufficient to demonstrate past persecution and Milanovic does not contest that on appeal. The IJ found credible Milanovic's testimony as to the beating at the restaurant, however, and held that the incident was sufficient to constitute past persecution. Accordingly, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[**5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milanovic was entitled to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution. The IJ held, however, that the government demonstrated a change in country conditions that rebutted that fear of future persecution. Specifically, the IJ noted that Slobodan Milosevic had been overthrown, and had died while on trial at the Hague for war crimes. Milosevic's Socialist Party was no longer in power in Serbia, and Milanovic's party, the Serbian Renewal Party, had been elected to some seats in parliament. Accordingly, the government had rebutted the presumption of future persecution. Milanovic did not offer evidence to establish that the threat persisted despite that change in power, and the IJ held that he had failed to meet the criteria for withholding of removal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the outset, we note that the transcription of the IJ's oral decision appears to be incomplete, as reflected in the disconnect between the first and second pages. To its credit, the government pointed out that discrepancy in its responsive brief to this court. Milanovic does not complain that the record is incomplete, or that any substantive aspect of the IJ's decision is missing. Moreover, our independent review of the record as a whole &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[**6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*570]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  makes clear that all portions of the oral decision relevant to the IJ's determination are transcribed, and we can review the decision. We note, however, that this is not the first time in this past year that we have been presented with an incomplete record. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Patel v. Holder</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 563 F.3d 565, 567 (7th Cir. 2009) (noting that one page of the IJ's decision was missing from the administrative record.) This is unacceptable and we trust that greater care will be exercised in the future to ensure that records presented to this court are accurate and complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We turn to the contention raised by Milanovic in this appeal. He argues that the IJ erred in determining that the government had rebutted his showing of past persecution by demonstrating that a transfer in power in Serbia constituted a change in country conditions. Milanovic asserts that it is insufficient for the IJ to rely merely on the country report to rebut a finding of past persecution, and also appears to argue that his claim of persecution was based on a local official's independent actions and therefore the demise of Milosevic does not address the basis of the persecution claim.  [HN2] In affirming the IJ, the BIA relied on the findings &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[**7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the IJ but added some analysis of its own. In such a circumstance, we review the IJ's decision as supplemented by the additional reasoning of the BIA. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Mema v. Gonzales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 474 F.3d 412, 416 (7th Cir. 2007); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Pavlyk v. Gonzales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 469 F.3d 1082, 1087 (7th Cir. 2006).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we noted, Milanovic appears to argue on appeal that his claim of persecution was based on the actions of a purely local official and thus the ouster of Milosevic could not constitute a change in country conditions sufficient to rebut the presumption of future persecution. It is questionable as to whether this argument is even preserved, because it is developed to some extent in the recitation of facts, but not in the argument section of the brief. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Long v. Teachers' Retirement System of Illinois</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 585 F.3d 344, 349 (7th Cir. 2009) ( [HN3] &quot;To present an argument on appeal, a party must develop its position by providing citation to the relevant portions of the record and supporting authority.&quot;) If raised, there is the additional problem that this argument was never presented to the IJ or the BIA. Although Milanovic challenged the finding that the country report rebutted his presumption of future persecution, he never challenged &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[**8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it on the ground that the actions of the officials were not tied to the ruling regime. In fact, before the IJ, the persecution was specifically characterized as having taken place at the hands of Milosevic supporters based on Milanovic's support for the opposition party. In his Statement in Support of I0589, Milanovic discussed his membership in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">movement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opposing Milosevic, and stated that his opposition resulted in the beating at the restaurant at the hands of a well-known Milosevic supporter Ratko Zecevic, stating that he was threatened with further harm if he continued his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">anti-Milosevic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> activities. That is consistent with his testimony at the hearing before the IJ. In fact, during closing arguments, his attorney argued that he had suffered the severe beating by Milosevic supporter Zecevic and the policemen because of his membership in the opposition. Similarly, the Brief in Support of Notice of Appeal states that &quot;supporters and police of President Slobodan [sic] Milosevic, namely Ratko Zecevic who was a judge and an official in his town together with several policemen, beat him severely and inflicted serious injuries on him.&quot; Therefore, throughout the administrative process, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[**9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Milanovic characterized the persecution as having been undertaken by Milosevic supporters because of his opposition to Milosevic. He never asserted that the persecution was &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*571]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  perpetrated by local officials acting independently such that the ouster of Milosevic and his party would lose relevance. Instead, the only argument raised to the BIA was the contention that the IJ erred in relying on the country report without giving him an opportunity to rebut it, thus &quot;taking the place of the Trial Attorney for the Department of Homeland Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have made clear that  [HN4] an alien must exhaust all administrative remedies before seeking review in this court, and that the duty to exhaust includes the obligation to present to the BIA each argument against the removal order. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Ishitiaq v. Holder</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 578 F.3d 712, 717-18 (7th Cir. 2009), citing 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1252(d)(1) and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Ghaffar v. Mukasey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 551 F.3d 651, 655 (7th Cir. 2008). In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Ishitiaq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, we held that Ishitiaq had waived his claim that the IJ had mistakenly equated past persecution with torture. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Ishitiaq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 578 F.3d at 718. We held that although Ishitiaq had challenged the finding of past persecution, he had based that challenge only on the argument that his &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[**10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case was distinguishable from the two cases relied upon by the IJ. That challenge did not preserve all possible challenges to the past persecution determination, however, but rather exhausted only the specific arguments actually raised. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Id</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, in this case, Milanovic raised only a challenge to the procedures used in relying on the country report, and to the role exercised by the IJ in using that report to rebut his presumption. Milanovic did not assert that the country report was insufficient to rebut his claim because the actions of the local officials were not tied to Milosevic or the party. Accordingly, this issue is waived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if it were considered, however, the testimony at the hearing and the standard of review would doom the claim.  [HN5] We review factual findings under the substantial evidence test, and will uphold them if supported by evidence a reasonable mind would find adequate to support the conclusion. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Terezov v. Gonzales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 480 F.3d 558, 563 (7th Cir. 2007). The IJ determined that the country report constituted a change in conditions sufficient to rebut the presumption of future persecution.  [HN6] We have repeatedly upheld the use of country reports to demonstrate such a change &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[**11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in conditions if the report addresses the specific basis for the alien's fear of persecution; where that individualized assessment is not made, or the report fails to address the basis for the fear of persecution at issue in the case, we have rejected such a use of the country reports. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Ayele v. Holder</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 564 F.3d 862, 871 (7th Cir. 2009); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Brucaj v. Ashcroft</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 381 F.3d 602, 607 (7th Cir. 2004); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Berishaj v. Ashcroft</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 378 F.3d 314, 327 (3d Cir. 2004). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">See also </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Pelinkovic v. Ashcroft</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 366 F.3d 532, 540-41 (7th Cir. 2004) (relying in part on the change in conditions following the removal of Milosevic as a basis to uphold BIA decision.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question, then, is whether the record supports the IJ's determination that the change in government in Serbia was sufficiently tied to Milanovic's fear of persecution as to rebut the presumption. Here, there is adequate evidence to support the IJ's determination that the removal of Milosevic constituted a change in country conditions sufficient to rebut the presumption of future persecution. At the hearing, the persecution suffered by Milanovic was tied to his actions in opposition to Milosevic and the Socialist Party, and the perpetrators were consistently &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[**12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> identified as Milosevic supporters. Accordingly, the IJ could reasonably conclude that with the removal of Milosevic and his party from power, Milanovic would no longer face the fear of future persecution for his actions in working toward that ouster. That does not mean that the country report &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*572]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is dispositive--it rebutted the presumption but did not ordain the outcome. Milanovic could still have proven entitlement to such withholding by demonstrating that the local officials were still in power, or that there was continued persecution in the country against those who had opposed Milosevic, but he did not do so. Although Milanovic states that he was not provided an opportunity to provide such evidence, he raises that contention in one sentence and never develops the argument, nor does he identify what evidence he would have introduced, and therefore he has not fairly presented that issue in this appeal. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Long v. Teachers' Retirement System of Illinois</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 585 F.3d 344, 349 (7th Cir. 2009) ( [HN7] &quot;A party may waive an argument by disputing a . . . ruling in a footnote or a one-sentence assertion that lacks citation to record evidence.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Milanovic contends that the BIA erred in failing to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[**13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> consider his claim for humanitarian asylum. The IJ rejected his claim for asylum because it was not timely filed, and Milanovic has not contested that determination. Therefore, he has presented no grounds for reversal. The decision of the IJ and the BIA is AFFIRMED.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A motion for summary judgment must be granted &quot;if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,&quot; based upon the depositions, affidavits, and other factual materials in the record. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), (c). A fact is &quot;material&quot; if it &quot;might affect the outcome of the suit under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the governing law.&quot; Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). And &quot;a dispute over a material fact is 'genuine' if 'the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.'&quot; Arrington v. United States, 473 F.3d 329, 333, 374 U.S. App. D.C. 189 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247). The moving party bears the initial burden of showing the absence of a disputed material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If this burden is satisfied by the moving party, the burden then shifts to the opposing party to &quot;set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.&quot; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. &quot;Although summary judgment is not the occasion for the court to weigh credibility or evidence, summary judgment is appropriate 'if the nonmoving party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.'&quot; Talavera v. Shah, 638 F.3d 303, 308, 395 U.S. App. D.C. 7 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citations omitted) (quoting Holcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d 889, 895, 369 U.S. App. D.C. 122 (D.C. Cir. 2006)). &quot;[T]here is no issue for trial unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a [reasonable] jury to return a verdict for that party.&quot; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. In making this assessment, &quot;[t]he evidence is to be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.&quot; Talavera, 638 F.3d at 308 (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255). These inferences, however, must be &quot;justifiable.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">II. BACKGROUND</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the outset, the Court notes that the plaintiff has made it difficult to discern which purported material facts are in dispute.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> See generally ECF No. 158-2, Plaintiff Philip Zepter's Statement of Genuine Issues of Material Facts in Opposition to Defendant [International Crisis Group]'s Motion for Summary Judgment (&quot;Material Facts I&quot;) (disputing the defendant's proffered undisputed material facts). In response to many of the allegedly undisputed facts proffered by the defendant, the plaintiff raises a garden variety of objections that do not genuinely dispute the truth of the undisputed facts asserted by the defendant. For example, the plaintiff merely cites case law, therefore making only legal arguments in many of its responses to the defendant's undisputed facts. But legal arguments alone are insufficient to create a factual dispute to defeat a motion for summary judgment. See Glass v. Lahood, 786 F. Supp. 2d 189, 199 (D.D.C. 2011) (&quot;legal memoranda are not evidence and cannot themselves create a factual dispute sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment&quot;), aff'd, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 24459, 2011 WL 6759550 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 8, 2011); see also Conservation Force v. Salazar, 715 F. Supp. 2d 99, 106 n.9 (D.D.C. 2010) (&quot;arguments of counsel . . . are not evidence&quot; (internal quotations and citations omitted)).<BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c20">2&nbsp;The Court will primarily cite to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c37">[*7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c20">  parties' submissions in connection with the defendant's motion for summary judgment, as that motion is dispositive and encompasses the relevant arguments made in the other motions before the Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff also repeatedly uses qualifiers that do not genuinely dispute the truth of the allegedly undisputed facts set forth by the defendant. Thus, when the defendant cites Serbian press articles from the record as the evidentiary basis for its undisputed facts, the plaintiff merely disputes those facts &quot;to the extent they rely on an article from the Serbian press which [the defendant] described as 'sensationalist bordering on libel' and 'notorious for spreading [rumors] and outright lies.'&quot; E.g., ECF No. 158-2, Material Facts I &para; 145 (quoting Pl.'s Private Figure Mot., ECF No. 145-4, Exhibit (&quot;Ex.&quot;) 12 (July 2003 International Crisis Group Report Entitled &quot;Serbian Reform Stalls Again&quot; (&quot;Report 145&quot;)) at 9-10). However, Report 145 does not reasonably suggest that these characterizations are attributable to all publications of the Serbian press in the relevant timeframe. See Pl.'s Private Figure Mot., ECF No. 145-4, Ex. 12 (Report 145) at 9-10. Indeed, the primary researcher and author&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Report 145 recognized that the accuracy of the Serbian press articles had to be assessed on a &quot;case-by-case basis.&quot; Def.'s Summ. J. Mot., ECF No. 150-1, Ex. 16 (Deposition of James Lyon, Ph.D. (&quot;Lyon Dep.&quot;)) at 22:6-15. Thus, where the plaintiff does not specifically dispute the facts from a particular Serbian press article by citing to evidence from the record, these facts remain uncontroverted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> See Local Civ. R. 7(h); see also Jackson v. Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett &amp; Dunner, 101 F.3d 145, 153, 322 U.S. App. D.C. 35 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (placing &quot;burden on the parties to focus the court's attention on the salient factual issues in what otherwise may amount to a mountain of exhibits and other materials&quot;).<BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c20">3&nbsp;Some of the Serbian press articles contain interviews with or quotes from the plaintiff. E.g., Def.'s Summ. J. Mot., ECF No. 151-3, Ex. 25; Def.'s Summ. J. Mot., ECF No. 151-5, Ex. 27. The plaintiff does not specifically contend that the Serbian press articles inaccurately reported what he publicly stated. In any event, as the Court will soon explain, the Serbian press articles cited by the defendant in support of its undisputed facts are not necessarily being used for the truth of the matters asserted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alternatively, when the defendant cites Serbian press articles as the evidentiary basis for its undisputed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  facts, the plaintiff sometimes merely disputes those facts &quot;to the extent they rely on a news article which is hearsay.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> E.g., ECF No. 158-2, Material Facts I &para; 145. This objection is without merit under controlling precedent, as the defendant cites these articles for purposes other than the truth of the matter asserted. See Def.'s Summ. J. Reply, ECF No. 163-21, Response of Defendant [International Crisis Group] to Plaintiff Philip Zepter's Statement of Genuine Issues of Material Fact and His Response to [International Crisis Group]'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (&quot;Resp. to Material Facts I&quot;) at 6-8. First, the articles assist the Court in identifying a public controversy, Waldbaum v. Fairchild Publ'ns, Inc., 627 F.2d 1287, 1297, 201 U.S. App. D.C. 301 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (&quot;The court can see if the press was covering the debate, reporting what people were saying and uncovering facts and theories to help the public formulate some judgment. It should ask whether a reasonable person would have expected persons beyond the immediate participants in the dispute to feel the impact of its resolution. If the issue was being debated publicly and if it had foreseeable and substantial ramifications for nonparticipants, it was a public controversy.&quot; (internal footnotes omitted)). And&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  second, they aid the Court in determining the plaintiff's role, if any, in that public controversy. Id. (&quot;The plaintiff either must have been purposely trying to influence the outcome or could realistically have been expected, because of his position in the controversy, to have an impact on its resolution. In undertaking this analysis, a court can look to the plaintiff's past conduct, the extent of press coverage, and the public reaction to his conduct and statements.&quot;).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>5</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c20">4&nbsp;Because some of these Serbian press articles contain interviews with or quotes from the plaintiff, it is unclear to the Court why these are not at least party admissions that are not excluded under the hearsay rule. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><BR></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c20">5&nbsp;Nowhere does the plaintiff contest that these articles were actually published by the Serbian press.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff also objects to the defendant's proffered undisputed facts that rely on reports from the defendant's experts on hearsay grounds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> E.g., ECF No. 158-2, Material Facts I &para; 24. But expert reports are an exception to the rule against hearsay in the summary judgment context. See Fed. R. Evid. 802 advisory committee's note (listing &quot;Rule 56: affidavits in summary judgment proceedings&quot; as an exception to prohibition against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hearsay). The Court, therefore, can and will consider expert reports in resolving the parties' summary judgment motions, provided that the expert has &quot;personal knowledge,&quot; &quot;set[s] out facts that would be admissible in evidence,&quot; and &quot;show[s] that [he or she] is competent to testify on the matters stated.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4)); see also Lohrenz v. Donnelly, 223 F. Supp. 2d 25, 37 (D.D.C. 2002), aff'd, 350 F.3d 1272, 358 U.S. App. D.C. 425 (D.C.

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c20">6&nbsp;The plaintiff repeatedly cites A-J Marine, Inc. v. Corfu Contractors, Inc., 810 F. Supp. 2d 168, 178 n.6 (D.D.C. 2011) and Mahnke v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Auth., 821 F. Supp. 2d 125 (D.D.C. 2011) in support of his argument that expert reports are hearsay. But neither case is helpful on that point. The Court in A-J Marine dealt with an &quot;unsworn&quot; report, 810 F. Supp. 2d at 178 n.6 (emphasis added), an issue that the plaintiff has not raised here. And in Mahnke, the Court discussed expert reports as hearsay in the context of their use at trial. 821 F. Supp. 2d at 154.</SPAN></P>

In particular, Report 145 addressed &quot;the inability of the Serbian government to assert civilian control over Milosevic-era police, military and intelligence agencies,&quot; as well as continuing Serbian &quot;concerns regarding the influence of wealthy businessmen on Serbia's fledgling democracy, businessmen commonly referred to as oligarchs or tycoons.&quot; Id.

The plaintiff does not contest, however, that Lyon has testified that he did in fact rely on confidential sources.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on Lyon's knowledge and his research, the following excerpt from Report 145 (&quot;challenged passage&quot;) was published:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c20">The unwillingness to continue the crackdown reflects the power of the Milosevic-era financial structures that-with the rigid oversight once provided by the dictator removed-have transformed themselves into a new Serbian oligarchy that finances many of the leading political parties and has tremendous influence over government decisions. Some of the companies were originally formed as fronts by State Security or Army Counterintelligence (KOS), while&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c37">[*33]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c20">  others operated at the direct pleasure of the ruling couple. Under Milosevic, many of these companies profited from special informal monopolies, as well as the use of privileged exchange rates. In return, many of them financed the regime and its parallel structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c39"><SPAN CLASS="c20">Some of the individuals and companies are well known to average Serbs: Delta Holding (Milorad Miskovic), Karic (Bogoljub Karic), Pink (Zeljko Mitrovic), Zepter (Milan Jankovic, aka Filip Zepter), Kapital Banka (Djordje Nicovic), Toza Markovic (Dmitar Segrt), Progres (Mirko Marjanovic), Simpo (Dragan Tomic), Komercijalna Banka (Ljubomir Mihajlovic), Novokabel (Djordje Siradovic), Stanko Subotic, Dibek (Milan Beko), ABC (Radisav Rodic), Hemofarm (Miodrag Babic), AIK Banka Nis (Ljubisa Jovanovic) and Dijamant (Savo Knezevic) are but some of the most prominent. Because of the support they gave to Milosevic and the parallel structures that characterised his regime, many of these individuals or companies have at one time or another been on EU visa ban lists, while others have had their assets frozen in Europe or the US.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>80</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c39"><SPAN CLASS="c20">In the popular mind, they and their companies were associated with the Milosevic regime and benefited from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c37">[*34]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c20">  it directly. The DOS campaign platform in September 2000 promised that crony companies and their owners would be forced to answer for past misdeeds. Few of the Milosevic crony companies have been subjected to legal action, however. The enforcement of the &quot;extra-profit&quot; law is often viewed as selective and there have been only a handful of instances in which back taxes, perhaps 65 million Euros worth, have been collected. Most disturbing is the public's perception that-at a time when the economy is worsening-these companies' positions of power, influence and access to public resources seem to have changed very little.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the District of Columbia Circuit partially reversed this Court's ruling, finding that the challenged passage in Report 145 was susceptible of a defamatory meaning and that the plaintiff's claims should not have been dismissed. Jankovic v. Int'l Crisis Grp., 494 F.3d 1080, 1091, 1092, 377 U.S. App. D.C. 434 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Following the Circuit's remand, the defendant filed another motion to dismiss, arguing that the challenged passage was shielded by the fair report and fair comment privileges, as well as protected as an opinion, and that the tortious interference claim was inadequately pleaded. See Jankovic, 593 F.3d at 25. The District of Columbia Circuit affirmed this Court's dismissal of the tortious interference claim, but&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*36]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reversed this Court's dismissal of the plaintiff's defamation and false light invasion of privacy claims, concluding that &quot;none of the privileges or protections raised&quot; by the defendant applied to the assertion that the plaintiff supported and received benefits from the Milosevic regime. Id. at 26. In support of the Circuit's conclusion, it found that footnote 80 in the challenged passage of Report 145, which purportedly led readers of the report to an Office of Foreign Assets Control (&quot;OFAC&quot;) website containing a 1998 frozen assets list and a 1998 Executive Order, id., did &quot;[n]ot . . . suggest[] that . . .

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First Amendment protection is afforded to defendants when the object of an alleged defamatory statement is about a public figure. New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964). The issue of whether a plaintiff is a public figure is a question of law for the courts to determine. See Waldbaum, 627 F.2d at 1294 n.12. There are two types of public figures: (1) general public figures who maintain such status for all purposes and (2) limited-purpose public figures &quot;'(who) voluntarily inject[] [themselves] or [are] drawn into a particular public controversy and therefore become[] . . . public figure[s] for a limited range of issues.&quot;' Id. at 1292 (quoting Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 351, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1974)). &quot;A person becomes a general purpose public figure only if he or she is 'a well-known celebrity,' his name a 'household word.'&quot; Tavoulareas v. Piro, 817 F.2d 762, 772, 260 U.S. App. D.C. 39 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (en&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*38]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  banc) (citation omitted). &quot;Few people,&quot; however, &quot;attain the general notoriety that would make them public figures for all purposes.&quot; Waldbaum, 627 F.2d at 1296. Much more common are &quot;public figures for the more limited purpose of certain issues or situations.&quot; Tavoulareas, 817 F.2d at 772. The defendant agrees that the plaintiff is not a general public figure. E.g., Private Figure Opp'n at 1. But the parties dispute whether the plaintiff is a limited-purpose public figure for a limited range of issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The District of Columbia Circuit has formulated a three-prong test to determine whether an individual is a limited-purpose public figure. Lohrenz v. Donnelly, 350 F.3d 1272, 1279, 358 U.S. App. D.C. 425 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (citing Waldbaum, 627 F.2d at 1294). First, the Court must determine whether a public controversy existed. See Waldbaum, 627 F.2d at 1296. This assessment requires the Court to determine whether there was &quot;a dispute that in fact ha[d] received public attention because its ramifications w[ould] be felt by persons who [we]re not direct participants.&quot; Id. at 1296. Second, the Court must analyze the plaintiff's role in the controversy. Id. at 1297. &quot;Trivial or tangential participation is not enough. . . . [To be considered a limited[-]purpose public figure, a plaintiff] must have achieved a 'special prominence' in the debate.&quot; Id. To satisfy the &quot;special prominence&quot; requirement, &quot;[t]he plaintiff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*39]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  either must have been purposely trying to influence the outcome or could realistically have been expected, because of his position in the controversy, to have an impact on its resolution.&quot; Id. Finally, the Court must assess whether the &quot;alleged defamation [was] germane to the plaintiff's participation in the controversy.&quot; Id. at 1298. As applied here, the defendant has established that the plaintiff is a limited-purpose public figure as determined by Waldbaum's three-prong test.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>15</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c20">15&nbsp;In reaching its conclusion that the plaintiff is a limited-purpose public figure, the Court did not rely on the plaintiff's business activities or philanthropic work, which the plaintiff contends are irrelevant to the limited-purpose-public-figure inquiry. See Summ. J. Opp'n at 18-22. Therefore, the Court need not address the propriety of those factors in conducting its analysis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">1. The Scope of the Public Controversy</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties do not dispute the existence of a public controversy &quot;concerning the progress of political and economic reform in Serbia and the integration of Serbia into international institutions.&quot; Pl.'s Private Figure Mot. at 5; Private Figure Opp'n at 4. Instead, they disagree as to the temporal scope of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*40]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the public controversy. See Private Figure Reply at 5. According to the plaintiff, the scope of the public controversy is addressed by Report 145--&quot;the post-Djindjic Serbian government's lack of progress in implementing political and economic reform and what that meant for Serbia's integration into the international community.&quot; Pl.'s Private Figure Mot. at 17 (emphasis in original); see also Summ. J. Opp'n at 8-9. But the defendant argues that the temporal scope of the public controversy is not so limited. See Private Figure Opp'n at 4-12; Def.'s Summ. J. Mot. at 16-24. The defendant concedes that Report 145 is relevant to the Court's task of identifying the proper temporal scope of the public controversy inquiry, but also argues that the Court must &quot;look[] beyond the content&quot; of Report 145 and evaluate the context in which Report 145 was published. Private Figure Opp'n at 4-5. Thus, the defendant contends that the proper temporal scope of the controversy is Serbian political and economic reform, and integration into international institutions, in the post-Milosevic Serbian government. Id. at 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court agrees with the defendant. In Waldbaum, the District of Columbia Circuit explained:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c20">To determine&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c37">[*41]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c20">  whether a controversy indeed existed and, if so, to define its contours, the judge must examine whether persons actually were discussing some specific question. . . . The court can see if the press was covering the debate, reporting what people were saying and uncovering facts and theories to help the public formulate some judgment. It should ask whether a reasonable person would have expected persons beyond the immediate participants in the dispute to feel the impact of its resolution. If the issue was being debated publicly and if it had foreseeable and substantial ramifications for nonparticipants, it was a public controversy.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waldbaum, 627 F.2d at 1297 (internal citations and footnotes omitted)).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>16</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c20">16&nbsp;The plaintiff suggests that press clippings that &quot;post-date the public of Report 145&quot; should be entitled to no weight. Private Figure Reply at 24; see also Summ. J. Opp'n at 14, 22-23. The plaintiff cites no case on point for the wholesale rejection of press articles that post-date the publication at issue in a libel case even if those articles discuss events that occurred on or before the challenged publication was published. To the extent that the articles are dated after Report 145's publication date of July 2003,&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c37">[*42]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c20">  the Court will only rely on the retrospective aspects of those articles. This is consistent with the Court's obligation in determining the plaintiff's private or public status when the allegedly defamatory statements were made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, a reasonable reading of Report 145 reveals that while it did emphasize economic and political reforms after the assassination of Djindjic, or the lack thereof, such reform was part of the &quot;larger debate&quot; concerning economic and political reforms in Serbia after the ouster of Milosevic from power in 2000. See Hatfill v. The New York Times Co., 532 F.3d 312, 322-23 (4th Cir. 2008); see also Tavoulareas, 817 F.2d at 767, 773 (identifying public controversy concerning how the United States' private oil industry &quot;should respond to the rise of OPEC and the ensuing energy crisis&quot; in the 1970s); OAO Alfa Bank v. Ctr. for Pub. Integrity, 387 F. Supp. 2d 20, 43 (D.D.C. 2005) (isolating the public controversy as &quot;[t]he rise of the oligarchs and the decline of the Russian economy into what one observer described as a 'criminal-syndicalist state' was one of the defining foreign policy controversies of the 1990s, and the topic of intense discussion in the media, classrooms, think tanks, and the government of the United States, as well as through the rest of the world&quot;). As the defendant correctly observes, Report 145 is replete with references to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*43]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  political and economic climate in Serbia prior to Djindjic's assassination. See Private Figure Opp'n at 10-12. Indeed, it would be extremely difficult to understand &quot;the post-Djindjic Serbian government's lack of progress in implementing political and economic reform and what that meant for Serbia's integration into the international community&quot; discussed in Report 145, Pl.'s Private Figure Mot. at 17 (second emphasis added), if Report 145 did not compare the degree of progress to the status quo before Djindjic's assassination. Thus, the plaintiff's reading of Report 145 is too narrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond Report 145, there was &quot;regular[]&quot; press attention given to the &quot;specific question,&quot; Waldbaum, 627 F.2d at 1297, of whether Serbian political and economic reform could take place once Milosevic's reign ended, ECF No. 158-2, Material Facts I &para; 164 (&quot;The future of Serbian reforms was of international concern, and prominent news publications regularly covered the issue.&quot;); ECF No. 151-9, Ex. 31 (January 2001 Economist Article) at 2 (&quot;One of Serbia's leading columnists, by no means a fan of Mr[.] Milosevic, calls Mr[.] Djindjic 'Little Slobo[,'] implying that he has the same dictatorial tendencies.&quot;); id. at 3 (&quot;If foreigners are to invest, the judiciary must be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*44]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cleaned up, and the criminals who ran the show under Mr[.] Milosevic must be dealt with. Many well-wishers fear that Mr[.] Djindjic, who is far from monkish himself, may not be inclined to take them on.&quot;). And one aspect of that public debate included Djindjic's ability to institute meaningful reforms in the Serbian government, notwithstanding his questionable associations with &quot;the financial elite.&quot; Def.'s Summ. J. Mot., ECF No. 151-10, Ex. 32 (January 2001 Reporter Article) at 2 (&quot;[T]here's a wave of attacks against Djindjic as well: statements that the changes he's trying to introduce are purely cosmetic and aimed at following the financial elite created during the Milosevic regime -- representatives of whom are allegedly his close friends -- to keep its positions and power[.]&quot;). &quot;The public plainly ha[d] a vital interest . . . in . . . the groups or factions supporting&quot; Djindjic, as well as the &quot;the quality of [his] . . . backers&quot; because they do &quot;play an influential role in ordering [Serbian] society.&quot; Thompson v. Evening Star Newspaper Co., 394 F.2d 774, 776, 129 U.S. App. D.C. 299 (D.C. Cir. 1968); see also Def.'s Summ. J.

The Plaintiff's Role in the Public Controversy</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff's participation in the public debate concerning economic and political reform in Serbia, and its integration into international institutions after Milosevic's downfall, was neither trivial nor tangential.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The standard of actual malice is a daunting one.&quot; McFarlane v. Esquire Magazine, 74 F.3d 1296, 1308, 316 U.S. App. D.C. 35 (D.C. Cir. 1996). To meet this burden, the plaintiff can &quot;come forward with any direct evidence of actual malice.&quot; OAO Alfa Bank, 387 F. Supp. 2d at 49. Otherwise, &quot;[p]roof of actual malice may take the form of circumstantial evidence.&quot; Id. at 50 (citing Clyburn, 903 F.2d at 33). Moreover, the plaintiff is &quot;entitled&quot; to &quot;the benefit of the aggregate of [the] evidence&quot; concerning actual malice. Lohrenz, 350 F.3d at 1283 (citing McFarlane, 74 F.3d at 1304, and Tavoulareas, 817 F.2d at 794 n.43). However, &quot;courts have identified only three scenarios in which the circumstantial evidence of subjective intent could be so powerful that it could provide clear and convincing proof of actual malice.&quot; Id. &quot;These scenarios are where there is evidence that the story: (i) was 'fabricated' or the product of defendants' imagination; (ii) is 'so inherently improbable that only a reckless man would have put [it] in circulation'; or (iii) is 'based wholly on a source that the defendant had obvious reasons to doubt, such as an unverified anonymous telephone call.'&quot; Id. (quoting McFarlane, 91 F.3d at 1512-13). &quot;[A]ctual malice[, however,] does not automatically become a question for the jury whenever the plaintiff introduces&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*66]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pieces of circumstantial evidence tending to show that the defendant published in bad faith.&quot; Tavoulareas, 817 F.2d at 789. &quot;Such an approach would be inadequate to ensure correct application of both the actual malice standard and the requirement of clear and convincing evidence.&quot; Id.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, because the plaintiff is a limited-purpose public figure, the burden of demonstrating actual malice proves too much for the plaintiff to overcome on summary judgment, as he merely introduces &quot;pieces of circumstantial evidence tending to show that the defendant published in bad faith,&quot; which are individually and collectively insufficient as a matter of law to demonstrate actual malice on the part of the defendant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Id. This burden is compounded by the plaintiff's seemingly erroneous understanding of the evidentiary standard for malice at the summary judgment stage for a limited public figure such as himself. See Summ. J. Opp'n at 26-27. The plaintiff asserts that it is unnecessary for him to come forward with clear and convincing evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the defendant acted with actual malice in publishing the challenged passage. See id. Not so.<BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

See, e.g., Summ. J. Opp'n at 26, 45. But based on the plaintiff's opposition to the defendant's motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff's understanding of what is &quot;sufficient&quot; to survive summary judgment on the issue of malice, is not &quot;clear and convincing&quot; evidence--it is some lesser standard.

<DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff's reliance on Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc., 960 F.2d 896 (9th Cir. 1992) is misplaced.

Id. at 900. The plaintiff's allegations there also suggested that the fact checker looked into the merits of the objections, the fact checker then removed some inaccuracies in the draft article, and that the changes were not incorporated into the final publication. See id. at 901. As a result of this conduct, the Ninth Circuit concluded that a jury could infer that the defendant had serious doubt about the accuracy of what was written about the plaintiff.

<DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth, the plaintiff asserts that the defendant's mistaken reliance on a United States frozen assets list from OFAC demonstrates actual malice.

The law does not support the plaintiff's assertion, as it amounts to nothing more than a failure to investigate, which alone does&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*77]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not prove actual malice.

Here, however, the defendant understood and interpreted the OFAC list in a manner consistent with OFAC. Summ. J.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifth, the plaintiff criticizes the defendant for relying on the Serbian press, which the defendant described in Report 145 as &quot;sensationalist bordering on libel&quot; and &quot;notorious for spreading [rumors] and outright lies.&quot; Summ. J. Opp'n at 39 (quoting Pl.'s Private Figure Mot., ECF No. 145-4, Ex. 12 (Report 145) at 9, 10). But, as explained earlier, the plaintiff has taken these characterizations out of context. A reasonable reading of Report 145 neither leads to the conclusion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*78]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nor even implies that all Serbian press articles cannot be trusted. See Pl.'s Private Figure Mot., ECF No. 145-4, Ex. 12 (Report 145) at 9-10. Similarly, the sources in the record cited by the plaintiff do not demonstrate that the defendant should have ignored the information published by the Serbian press entirely. See Summ. J. Opp'n at 39-40. In fact, Lyon, who was one of the Balkan experts at the International Crisis Group and the primary researcher and author of Report 145, recognized that the accuracy of the press had to be assessed on a &quot;case-by-case basis,&quot; as some press articles relied on &quot;detailed information from certain government media files.&quot; Def.'s Summ. J. Mot., ECF No. 150-1, Ex. 16 (Lyon Dep.) at 22:6-22. To the extent that the Serbian press lacked some degree of credibility, reliance on &quot;some&quot; of its articles is insufficient for a finding of actual malice. See McFarlane, 91 F.3d at 1508 (&quot;'[T]he plaintiff must establish that even in relying upon an otherwise questionable source the defendant actually possessed subjective doubt.'&quot; quoting Secord, 747 F. Supp. at 794); Lohrenz, 350 F.3d at 1286 (&quot;'reliance upon some biased sources . . . do[es] not amount to reckless disregard of the truth'&quot; (quoting Loeb v. New Times Communs. Corp., 497 F. Supp. 85, 93 (S.D.N.Y. 1980))). In fact, the defendant's recognition that some unreliability exists,&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*79]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rebuts the plaintiff's contention that the defendant acted with actual malice. See McFarlane, 74 F.3d at 1304 (&quot;full (or pretty full) publication of the grounds for doubting a source tends to rebut a claim of malice, not to establish one&quot; (citing Tavoulareas, 817 F.2d at 788 n.35)).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixth, the plaintiff objects to the defendant's reliance on confidential sources to dispel any notion that it did not act maliciously in publishing the allegedly defamatory publication.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>32</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Summ.

McFarlane, 91 F.3d at 1508 (quoting Secord, 747 F. Supp. at 794 ). The plaintiff has not presented clear and convincing evidence as to why Lyon should have doubted, let alone that he did doubt, the reliability of his confidential sources. The plaintiff, without proof, merely calls them &quot;shadowy,&quot; Summ. J. Opp'n at 44, which is insufficient to show that Lyon should&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*80]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  have doubted the information he received from his confidential sources, see McFarlane, 91 F.3d at 1508 (allowing the defendant to rely on a questionable source so long as there is no subjective doubt on the part of the defendant).<BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>

That was not done.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the plaintiff's charge that Lyon &quot;targeted Zepter . . . for extortion&quot; is an appealing basis for finding actual malice at first blush.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>33</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Summ.

<P CLASS="c25"><SPAN CLASS="c20">It is settled that ill will toward the plaintiff or bad motives are not elements of actual malice and that such evidence is insufficient by itself to support a finding of actual malice. The rationale for this rule is that speech honestly believed, whatever the speaker's motivation, contributes to the free interchange of ideas and the ascertainment of truth. To recover, plaintiffs cannot ground their claim on a showing of intent to inflict harm, but must, instead, show an intent to inflict harm through falsehood. . . . The appropriateness of such evidence must be determined on a case-by-case basis, bearing in mind that evidence of ill will or bad motives will support a finding of actual malice only when combined with other, more substantial evidence of a defendant's bad faith.</SPAN></P>

The plaintiff's reliance on this collateral electronic correspondence is misplaced. The substance of the electronic correspondence does not concern the challenged passage of Report 145, so it is not evidence that Lyon subjectively doubted the accuracy of the challenged passage in Report 145. And there is no indication from the record that Lyon was informed by anyone, aside from the plaintiff, that the association drawn between Milosevic and the plaintiff in Report 145 was unfounded.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, even if Lyon attempted to solicit money from the plaintiff in return for Lyon's termination of his derogatory allegations about the plaintiff, this does not show a &quot;willingness to publish falsehoods&quot; about the plaintiff.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Id. To the contrary, during this alleged meeting, the plaintiff admits that Lyon told him that he &quot;ha[d] reliable sources&quot; and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*83]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that he &quot;believed&quot; that what he wrote about the plaintiff was &quot;true.&quot; Summ. J. Reply, ECF No. 163-12, Ex. 8 (Deposition of Philip Zepter (&quot;Zepter Dep. I&quot;)) at 307:21-311:7. In fact, the plaintiff admits that allegations concerning the others identified along with him in the challenged passage of Report 145 as allegedly having supported Milosevic, are &quot;mostly&quot; true. Def.'s Summ. J. Mot., ECF No. 150-7, Ex. 22 (Deposition of Philip Zepter II (&quot;Zepter Dep. II&quot;) at 292:3-5 (&quot;I[ am] in the same category like all these people that really have connections with the Milosevic regime.&quot;); id. at 292:6-11 (&quot;Q: . . . Do you agree that the other people in the category who were listed did have [connections with Milosevic?] -- A: Mostly. Yes.&quot;). So, there is no basis for the Court to find that Lyon had reason to subjectively entertain serious doubts as to the truth of what was published about the plaintiff in Report 145, as he was legally permitted to rely on confidential sources. See McFarlane, 91 F.3d at 1508. Although the Court certainly does not condone such journalistic behavior, if in fact it occurred,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the law of this Circuit does not permit the plaintiff to prove malice through &quot;contemptible&quot; behavior. See Tavoulareas, 817 F.2d at 796 (&quot;[The defendant]'s&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*84]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  avowed interest in [unlawfully] obtaining documentary evidence from [the plaintiff] . . ., no matter how contemptible the means to be employed, does not indicate a willingness to publish unsupported allegations.&quot; (emphasis in original)). The case law &quot;resoundingly rejects the proposition that a motive to disparage someone is evidence of actual malice.&quot; Parsi, 890 F. Supp. 2d at 90.<BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c20">35&nbsp;The plaintiff seems to contradict himself concerning his contact with Lyon before Report 145 was published. According to the plaintiff, the defendant, i.e., Lyon, &quot;never contacted [the plaintiff] for comment concerning the allegations or anything else in Report 145 before publishing Report 145.&quot; ECF No. 157-1, Material Facts II &para; 20 (emphasis added); see also Summ. J. Opp'n at 32. Yet the plaintiff testified during his deposition that he met with Lyon either &quot;shortly before&quot; or &quot;shortly after[]&quot; Report 145 was published. Summ. J. Opp'n, ECF No. 163-12, Ex. 8 (Zepter Dep. I) at 301:9-20. In light of this seeming contradiction, it can be reconciled only if what the plaintiff sought to convey is that his meeting with Lyon must have occurred after the defendant published Report 145. And even if Lyon had reason to subjectively doubt the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c37">[*85]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c20">  accuracy of what he wrote after Report 145 was published, that is insufficient to demonstrate actual malice. See Parsi, 890 F. Supp. 2d at 88 (&quot;[A] plaintiff must show [that the] defendant 'realized the inaccuracy at the time of publication.'&quot; (emphasis in original) (quoting Bose Corp., 466 U.S. at 512)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><BR></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c20">36&nbsp;The plaintiff filed a motion to strike expense receipts from Lyon that the defendant attached in its reply memorandum in support of the defendant's motion for summary judgment. Pl.'s Strike Mot. at 1. The expense receipts purportedly rebut Lyon's attempt to extort the plaintiff in Geneva, Switzerland. See id. at 2. But because the Court finds no actual malice on the part of the defendant in publishing the challenged passage of Report 145, notwithstanding any meeting between the plaintiff and Lyon, the plaintiff's motion is moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the Court's examination of the plaintiff's proffered evidence of actual malice in the aggregate does not compel a different outcome, see Lohrenz, 350 F.3d at 1283, 1284 (recognizing that plaintiff was entitled to &quot;the benefit of the aggregate of her evidence&quot; regarding actual malice, but finding no malice despite evidence that the defendant was &quot;on a mission to advance a preconceived story line,&quot; that the defendant &quot;acted on the basis of a biased&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*86]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  source,&quot; and that the defendant had &quot;incomplete information&quot;); McFarlane, 91 F.3d at 1510, 1511-14 (finding &quot;cumulative force of the evidence&quot; of actual malice to be &quot;very weak&quot; where evidence demonstrated a &quot;failure to contact any individual who would have had first-hand knowledge,&quot; a &quot;lack of corroboration,&quot; a reliance on a source with &quot;credibility&quot; issues, as well as a document that yielded an &quot;inconsistency&quot;), as even collectively, it does not demonstrate clearly and convincingly that the challenged passage in Report 145 was fabricated, inherently improbable, or based on a source that the defendant or any of its employees had obvious reasons to doubt, Lohrenz, 350 F.3d at 1284. In sum, none of the plaintiff's proffered evidence is enough to bring this case before a jury that must find by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant maliciously published the challenged passage in Report 145.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>37</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c29"><SPAN CLASS="c20">37&nbsp;The plaintiff's argument that the defendant should be barred from relying on a report from the Office of the High Representative (&quot;OHR Report&quot;) for any purpose in resolving the parties' dispute is well founded. Summ. J. Opp'n at 40-41. The defendant unequivocally represented to the Court on several occasions that the OHR Report was not relevant to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c37">[*87]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c20">  this litigation. See id. (citing all instances where the defendant instructed the Court to ignore the OHR Report). The plaintiff has undoubtedly relied on that representation and to allow the defendant to change course now would certainly prejudice the plaintiff. See New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749, 121 S. Ct. 1808, 149 L. Ed. 2d 968 (2001) (&quot;'[W]here a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken by him.'&quot; (alteration in original) (quoting Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U.S. 680, 689, 15 S. Ct. 555, 39 L. Ed. 578 (1895)). In light of the defendant's earlier representations, the Court must judicially estop it from relying on the OHR report.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">4. The Defendant's Motion to Strike Hearsay Declarations</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant sought to preclude the Court from considering, in its summary judgment analysis, the declarations of three individuals submitted by the plaintiff, by moving to strike them on hearsay grounds. See Def.'s Mot. to Strike at 1-3. Those declarations were provided by the following individuals: (1) Dris Sayad, Pl.'s Private Figure Mot., ECF No. 145-6, Declaration of Dris Sayad (&quot;Sayad Decl.&quot;); (2) Vibor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*88]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mulic, Summ. J. Opp'n, ECF No. 158-8, Declaration of Vibor Mulic (&quot;Mulic Decl.&quot;); and (3) Elmar Jordan, Summ. J. Opp'n, ECF No. 158-9, Declaration of Elmar Jordan (&quot;Jordan Decl.&quot;). Def.'s Mot. to Strike at 1-2. The declaration of Dris Sayad generally describes the substance of a meeting he had with a man named Stanko Subotic, during which Subotic allegedly explained how he was the target of an extortion scheme by Lyon. See Pl.'s Private Figure Mot., ECF No. 145-6, Sayad Decl. &para;&para; 2-4, 6-7. Likewise, Vibor Mulic's declaration describes meetings he had with, among others, a man named Bogoljub Karic. See Summ. J. Opp'n, ECF No. 158-8, Mulic Decl. &para; 4. During these meetings, Karic allegedly also described an extortion attempt by Lyon. Id. &para;&para; 5-7. Elmar Jordan's declaration calls into question the alleged Office of the High Representative report (&quot;OHR Report&quot;) relied upon by the defendant in publishing Report 145. See Summ. J. Opp'n, ECF No. 158-9, Jordan Decl. &para;&para; 1-4. The Court will grant the defendant's motion to strike the declarations of Dris Sayad and Vibor Mulic, but deny the motion to strike the declaration of Elmar Jordan as moot because the defendant was judicially estopped from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">[*89]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  relying on the OHR report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The declarations of Sayad and Mulic essentially serve as mouthpieces for Subotic and Karic, respectively. The defendant attempted to depose Subotic and Karic abroad in this case, but to no avail. See Pl.'s Private Figure Mot., ECF No. 145-6, Sayad Decl. &para; 2 (&quot;Mr. Subotic also agreed to give his deposition in this case at a later date. I have been advised that he did not appear when scheduled in a Geneva Court.&quot;); Summ. J. Opp'n, ECF No. 158-8, Mulic Decl. &para; 3 (&quot;I understand that Mr. Karic was going to testify in this action but that he was unable to do so.&quot;); see also Def.'s Mot. to Strike at 5, 9 (describing efforts to depose Subotic and Karic). The Court will not allow the plaintiff to subvert the discovery process by using these declarations to oppose the defendant's motion for summary judgment, as the defendant has not had the opportunity to cross-examine the testimony of either Subotic or Karic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c22"><SUP>38</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cf.
